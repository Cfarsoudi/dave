                   NOISES of Enterprise bridge, clicking of relays,

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              Captain's log. Stardate 8130.3,
                             Starship Enterprise on training
                             mission to Gamma Hydra. Section 14,
                             coordinates 22/87/4. Approaching
                             Neutral Zone, all systems
                             functioning.

 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 
                   As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations;
                   (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER
                   SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con-
                   sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The
                   Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young
                   and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan.
                   In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her
                   skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless
                   facial immobility of a Vulcan.

 SULU                              Leaving Section Fourteen for
                             Section Fifteen.

 SAAVIK                              Project parabolic course to
                             avoid entering Neutral Zone.

 SULU                              Aye, Captain.

 UHURA                                      (suddenly)
                             Captain... I'm getting something
                             on the distress channel. Minimal
                             signal... But something...

 SAAVIK                              Can you amplify?

 UHURA                              I'm trying...

 SULU                              Course change projected.

 UHURA                              It's an emergency distress call!

 SAAVIK                              On speakers!

 VOICE                                      (filtered, breaking up)
                             Imperative! Imperative! This is
                             the Kobayashi Maru -- nineteen
                             periods out of Altair Six. We
                             have struck a gravitic mine and
                             have lost all power... Our hull
                             is...

                             ... and many casualties.

 UHURA                              This is the Starship Enterprise.

                             us, Enterprise? Can you...

                   Breaks up.

 SAAVIK                              Data on Kobayashi Maru! Tactical!

 SAAVIK                              Damn.
                                     (then)
                             Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course.

 SULU                              May I remind the Captain that if a
                             Starship enters the zone --

 SAAVIK                              I'm aware of my responsibilities,
                             Mister.

 SULU                                      (with a nod)
                             ... Now entering the Neutral 
                             Zone...

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Warning. We have entered the
                             Neutral Zone... Warning...

 SULU                              Estimating two minutes to intercept.

                   On screen: Enterprise approaches the stricken vessel.

 SAAVIK                              Stand by transporter room, ready
                             to beam survivors, aboard.

 UHURA                              Captain, I've lost their signal!

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Alert. Sensors indicate three
                             Klingon Cruisers, bearing 316,
                             mark 4, closing fast.

 SAAVIK                              Visual!

                   On screen we see the approach  of the Klingon vessels,
                   they are dark and sinister.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Battle stations! Activate shields!

                   The ALARM SOUNDS.

 SULU                              Shields activated!

 SAAVIK                              Inform the Klingons we are on a
                             rescue mission...

 UHURA                              They're jamming all frequencies,
                             Captain --

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingons on attack course and closing.

                   Screen verifies this. Saavik makes an agonized choice.

 SAAVIK                              We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu,
                             get us out of here.

 SULU                              I'll try, Captain.

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingon cruisers approaching,
                             bearing 090, mark 20.

 SAAVIK                              Visual!

                   The image flops: more Klingons approach. They FIRE
                   photon torpedoes.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Evasive action!

                   Sulu does his best, but Enterprise is hit; Sulu is
                   hurled from his station, and Bones hurries to him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Engineering! damage report!

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (INTERCOM)                              Main energizer hit, Captain!

 SAAVIK                              Engage auxiliary power. Prepare
                             to return fire!

                   The bridge takes another hit -- a big one. In its wake
                   there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the communi-
                   cations panel. Uhura falls from her station. Bones
                   rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

 A CADET                              Shields collapsing, Captain!

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, we're losing auxiliary
                             power!

 SAAVIK                              Fire all phasers...!

 SPOCK                              No power to the weapons system,
                             sir.

                   Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame
                   on the bridge. Spock dies. Bones comes to him, but
                   even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final
                   hit and Bones falls. The room is smoke filled and a
                   shambles. Saavik looks about in shock.

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, it's no use. We're
                             dead in space.

                   Saavik digests this for a painful moment. Then, touch-
                   ing a comm button:

 SAAVIK                              Activate escape pods. Send out the
                             Log Buoy... All hands abandon ship.
                             Repeat -- all hands --

 KIRK'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              All right, open her up.

                   There is a loud CLANGING and  --

 4 FULL SHOT - ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 4 
                   The side walls of the "bridge" slide apart, revealing
                   a lighted room beyond. Through the opening strides
                   KIRK. He stops, surveys the shambles, and shakes his
                   head.

 SAAVIK                              Any suggestions, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons
                             do not take prisoners.
                                     (to Spock)
                             Captain.

 SPOCK                              Trainees to the briefing room.

                   Sulu awakens with a grin. Uhura straightens herself
                   demurely. The Trainees head toward the distant room,
                   Spock rises and leaves. Bones remains on the floor,
                   head propped in his hand, whimsically.

 KIRK                              Physician, heal thyself.

 BONES                              That's all you have to say?

 KIRK                              I'm not a drama critic.

                   Bones rolls his eyes and rises. Kirk sees Saavik who
                   has not moved.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going
                             to stay with the sinking ship?

 SAAVIK                              Permission to speak candidly, sir?

 KIRK                              Very well.

 SAAVIK                                      (fights emotion)
                             I don't believe this was a fair
                             test of my command capabilities.

 KIRK                              And why not?

 SAAVIK                              Because... there was no way to win.

 KIRK                              A no-win situation is a possibility
                             every commander may face. Has that
                             never occurred to you?

 SAAVIK                              ... No, sir. It has not.

 KIRK                              How we deal with death is at least
                             as important as how we deal with
                             life, wouldn't you say?

 SAAVIK                                      (falters)
                             As I indicated, Admiral, that
                             thought had not occurred to me.

 KIRK                              Then you have something new to think
                             about. Carry on.

                   She stays at attention.

 BONES                              Wouldn't it be easier to put
                             an experienced crew back on the
                             ship?

 KIRK                              They'll learn. Galloping about the
                             cosmos is a game for the young,
                             doctor.

                   He leaves. They look at each other.

 UHURA                                      (offended)
                             What is that supposed to mean?

                   HOLD ON Saavik.

 5 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY 5 
                   Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against
                   the wall.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             Aren't you dead?

                   Spock almost smiles.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             I assume you are loitering here
                             to learn what efficiency rating
                             I plan to give your cadets.

 SPOCK                              I am understandably curious.

                   They walk together.

 KIRK                              They destroyed the simulator room
                             and you with it.

 SPOCK                              The Kobayshi Maru scenario 
                             frequently wreaks havoc with
                             students and equipment.
                                     (dry)
                             As I recall you took the test
                             three times yourself. Your final
                             solution was, shall we say, unique?

 KIRK                                      (solemn)
                             It had the virtue of never having
                             been tried.                             

 SPOCK                              Yours was not a solution which
                             would have occurred to a Vulcan
                             mentality.

 KIRK                              So you said at the time. Speaking
                             of which, your protg's first
                             rare -- a trifle emotional --

 SPOCK                              She's half Romulan, Jim. The
                             admixture makes her more volatile
                             than -- me, for example.

 KIRK                              Than you. Yes, I see that. By
                             the way, thank you for this.

                   He lifts the book.

 SPOCK                              I know of your fondness for antiques.

 KIRK                                      (reads)
                             'It was the best of times, it was
                             the worst of times...' Message,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK                              None of which I am consciously
                             aware -- except, of course, happy
                             birthday -- surely the best of times.

                   Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps:

 KIRK                              Hrummm... and where are you off
                             to, now?

 SPOCK                              The Enterprise. I must check in
                             before your inspection. And you?

 KIRK                                      (shortly)
                             Home.

                   Spock studies him --

 SPOCK                              Something oppresses you.

                   They are old friends --

 KIRK                              Something.

                   He steps into a turbo elevator. The doors close as
                   Spock watches, wiping the scene.

                   In f.g. is the U.S.S. RELIANT, an older, somewhat
                   battered starship of the ENTERPRISE class, with a
                   slightly different configuration. Reliant approaches
                   an inhospitable-looking yellow planet: CETI ALPHA V

 7 INT. BRIDGE OF RELIANT 7 
                   Well-aged and distinctive. The usual compliment of
                   officers and crew. CAPTAIN CLARK TERRELL, about 45,
                   soft spoken and in good shape, but somewhat laconic.

                   Behind Terrell, surveying the data screen is COMMANDER
                   CHEKOV, aged some, but still boyish.

 TERRELL                              Standard orbit, Mr. Beach.

 BEACH                              Standard orbit, sir.

 TERRELL                              Any change in surface scan?

 BEACH                              Negative. Limited atmosphere,
                             dominated by craylon gas, sand and
                             high velocity winds. Incapable
                             of supporting life forms.

                   Forward screen: Ceti Alpha.

 CHEKOV                              Does it have to be completely
                             lifeless?

                   Terrell rises and crosses to Chekov.

 TERRELL                              Don't tell me you've got something.

 CHEKOV                                      (points)
                             We've picked up a minor energy flux
                             reading on one dyno scanner.

 TERRELL                              Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the
                             scanner's out of adjustment --

 CHEKOV                              I suppose it could be a particle
                             of preanimate matter caught in the
                             matrix...

 TERRELL                              All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to
                             Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something
                             we can transplant.

 CHEKOV                              You know what she'll say...

 8 EXT. DEEP SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION 8 
                   A functional cluster of modules serve as a scientific
                   complex, a futuristic White Sands, orbiting a small
                   barren plantoid in b.g.: Regula.

 CAROL MARCUS'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Something you can transplant? I
                             don't know --

 9 INT. SPACE STATION - CAROL'S LAB 9 
                   Big but deserted except for Carol, in contact with
                   Reliant. Surrounded by equipment clearly meant for
                   many workers, CAROL MARCUS is in her early forties,
                   attractive and intelligent. Static mars the trans-
                   missions.

                   On the monitor: Terrell and Chekov, looking hopeful.

 TERRELL                              It might only be a particle of
                             preanimate matter...

 CAROL                              Then again it might not. You
                             boys have to be clear on this:
                             there can't be so much as a
                             microbe or the show's off.
                                     (she thinks)
                             Why don't you have a look? If it
                             IS something that can be moved...

 TERRELL                                      (eager)
                             You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

                   Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.

 10 INT. CORRIDOR, SPACE STATION REGULA I 10 
                   Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with
                   DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
                   He is good looking and humorous.

 DAVID                              How can you let them pull that
                             stuff on you? They're just lazy.

 CAROL                              And bored. I know. But maybe it
                             IS something they can...

 DAVID                              Come on, Mother, that's just the
                             military mentality. Never put off
                             tomorrow what you can put off today.
                             If there's one atom of life...

 CAROL                              I know, I know...

                   Silence.

 DAVID                              Well, don't have kittens.
                             Genesis is going to work. They'll
                             remember  you in a wreath with
                             Newton, Einstein, Surak...

 CAROL                                      (mock outrage)
                             Thanks a lot. No respect from my
                             offspring --

 DAVID                              Par for the course... you teaming
                             up with me for bridge after dinner?

 CAROL                              Maybe...

 DAVID                              Every time we have dealings with
                             Starfleet, I get nervous.
                                     (shrugs)
                             We're dealing with something
                             that COULD be perverted into
                             a dreadful weapon. Remember that
                             overgrown boy scout you used to
                             hang out with? That's exactly
                             the --

                   They walk past the CAMERA, their VOICES FADING.

 CAROL                              Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many
                             things, but he was never a Boy
                             Scout...

                   HOLD ON the empty corridor.

 11 INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT 11 
                   Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. His flat befits
                   an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except
                   a collection of antiques.

 WE HEAR A SOFT BONG. 
                   Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.

 KIRK                              Come.

                   The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two
                   packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Bless me, doctor; and what beams
                             you into this neck of the woods?

 BONES                              'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'
                             Happy Birthday...

                   With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue
                   liquid.

 KIRK                              Romulan Ale! Bones, you know
                             this stuff is illegal --

 BONES                                      (broad)
                             I only use it for medicinal
                             purposes. Don't be a pring...

 KIRK                                      (reading the label
                                       with difficulty)
                             Twenty-two, eighty-three...

 BONES                              Takes the stuff a while to
                             ferment. Gimme.

                   He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Now open the other one.

                   Kirk starts to obey.

 KIRK                              I'm almost afraid to. What did
                             you bring me, contraband Klingon --

 BONES                              More antiques for your collection
                             -- Cheers!

                   They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold
                   "Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is
                   an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.)

 KIRK                              Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.

 BONES                              Four hundred years old. You don't
                             find many with the lens still
                             intact.

 KIRK                              Uh -- what are they?

 BONES                              For your eyes. For most patients
                             of your age, I generally administer
                             Retlax Five to restore flexibility
                             of the lens.

 KIRK                              But I'm allergic to Retlax.

 BONES                              Exactly. Happy birthday.

                   He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Slide them down your nose. Now look
                             at me over the top. And you read
                             printed matter through the bottom.

 KIRK                                      (reacts)
                             Amazing! I don't know what to say --

 BONES                              Say thank you.

 KIRK                              Thank you.

                   An awkward silence.

 BONES                              Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the
                             matter? Other people have birthdays.
                             Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

 KIRK                              Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

 BONES                              What DO you want? Damn it, why
                             isn't there a girl here? You know
                             this has nothing to do with age.
                             This is about you flying a goddamn
                             computer console when you wanna be
                             out hopping Galaxies.

 KIRK                              Spare me your notions of poetry,
                             please. We all have our assigned
                             duties and...

 BONES                              Bull. You're hiding -- hiding
                             behind the rules and regulations --

 KIRK                              And who am I hiding from?

 BONES                              From yourself, Admiral.

                   Pause. Kirk pours another drink.

 KIRK                              Don't mince words, Bones; tell
                             me what you really think.

 BONES                                      (mild take)
                             I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, 
                             Jim. Get back your command. Get it
                             back before you really do grow old.
                             Before you turn into part of this
                             collection.

                   They look at each other.

 12 EXT. RELIANT - DEEP SPACE 12

                   filtered, are hard to make out.

                   With the TRICORDER to guide them, they set out...

 TERRELL                              Are you sure these are the
                             coordinates?

 CHEKOV                              Captain, this is the garden spot
                             of Ceti Alpha VI --

 TERRELL                              I can hardly see --

 15 SEVERAL ANGLES 15 
                   The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind --

 16 TERRELL 16 
                   is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise --

 CHEKOV                              There's nothing, let's go --

 17 ANGLE 17 
                   Terrell waves him frantically forward. As Chekov
                   moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and
                   look down.

 18 ANGLE - THEIR POV 18 
                   A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half buried in
                   sand. They look at each other in consternation. Chekov
                   is worried; something about all this is familiar.

                   They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
                   wreckage of some sort of space craft.

                   They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
                   buried next to their feet.

 TERRELL                              They look like cargo carriers...

                   As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks
                   back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition
                   scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He
                   screams.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What is it?

                   He comes clumsily over --

 CHEKOV                              A face! I saw -- it was like a
                             child --

                   He points. The porthole is empty.

 TERRELL                              You're crazy -- !

 CHEKOV                              I saw it -- !

 TERRELL                              There's an air-lock.

                   He points and they go into the airlock.

 19 INT. CARGO HOLD 19 
                   Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV.
                   Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury-
                   rigged -- but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.

 TERRELL                              There's breathable atmosphere in here.

                   He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What the hell is this? Did they
                             crash? Where's the rest of the
                             ship?

                   They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be-
                   speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a
                   laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; A LARGE SAND TANK
                   filled with disgusting CETI EELS.

                   ABRUPTLY A SOUND -- They start: CHILD'S GURGLE.

 CHEKOV                                      (terrified)
                             I told you! I told you I saw a --

 TERRELL                              Ssssh!

                   They start looking. They enter a new chamber --

 20 KHAN'S QUARTERS 20 
                   On its side in the sand: the walls are now the floor,
                   etc. All in crookedness -- like its owner. On the
                   floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.

                   Tentatively they come over to it, looking around --

 21 ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV 21 
                   Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;
                   CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING
                   LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE -- and a seat belt dangling with
                   the name on it -- Botany Bay.

                   Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud --

 CHEKOV                              Botany Bay -- oh no!

 TERRELL                                      (examines the child)
                             What's the matter -- ?

                   Chekov runs, tries to get his helmet on, tries to drag
                   Terrell --

 CHEKOV                              Captain, we've got to get out of
                             here -- now! Damn! Hurry!

                   Terrell catches his urgency --

 TERRELL                              But the child --

 CHEKOV                              Never mind! Hurry!

 22 EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY 22 
                   Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.

 23 ANGLE - THEIR POV 23 
                   A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.

 24 INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE 24 
                   Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti
                   Alpha V on the forward screen.

 BEACH                              Try again.

 KYLE                              Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell
                             ... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will
                             you please respond, Captain...
                             Captain Terrell, respond please.

                   Nothing.

 BEACH                                      (thinks)
                             Let's give them a little more
                             time.

 25 INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V 25 
                   Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.

                   They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM.

                   Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A
                   moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri-
                   fied. The mask is peeled back.

 CHEKOV                                      (aloud despite himself)
                             Khan!

                   KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and
                   examines Chekov and Terrell.

 KHAN                                      (finally)
                             I don't know you. But you. I never
                             forget a face. Mister Chekov,
                             isn't it?
                                     (wonderingly)
                             I never thought to see your face
                             again.

 TERRELL                              Chekov, who is this man?

 CHEKOV                              A criminal, Captain -- a product of
                             the late 20th Century genetic
                             engineering --

 TERRELL                              What do you want with us? I demand --

 KHAN                                      (mild)
                             You are in a position to demand
                             nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,
                             am in a position to grant nothing.
                             What you see is all that remains of
                             the ship's company and the crew of the
                             Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen
                             years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

 TERRELL                              Listen to me -- you men and women --

 KHAN                              Save your strength, Captain, these
                             people have sworn to live and die at
                             my command two hundred years before
                             you were born. Do you mean he...
                                      (i.e. Chekov)
                             ... never told you the tale?
                             To amuse you, Captain? Never told
                             you how the Enterprise picked up the
                             Botany Bay, lost in space from the
                             year 1996, myself and the ship's
                             company in cryogenic freeze?

 TERRELL                              I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

 KHAN                              Admiral? He didn't tell you how
                             Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into
                             exile on this barren sand heap with
                             only the contents of these cargo bays
                             to sustain us?

 CHEKOV                              You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was
                             life, a fair chance to --

 KHAN                              This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI
                             exploded six months after we were
                             left here. The shock shifted the
                             orbit of this planet and everything
                             was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never
                             bothered to check on our progress.
                             It was only the fact of my genetically
                             engineered intellect that enabled us
                             to survive! On earth, two hundred
                             years ago, I was a prince, with power
                             over millions -- now, like Prometheus
                             I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
                             digest my own entrails.

 CHEKOV                              Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid
                             his hospitality by trying to steal his
                             ship and murder him.

 KHAN                                      (moves closer)
                             And I'll wager he never told you
                             about his shipmate, the beautiful
                             and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,
                             who gave up everything to join me
                             in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how
                             Admiral Kirk requited her devotion --
                             She's dead as earth!

                   The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his
                   eyes are filled with tears.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             A plague upon you all.

                   He recovers his poise and returns to them --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             You didn't expect to find me.
                             You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.
                             Why are you here?

                   They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH
 ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR -- 
 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Why?

                   Terrell gasps, stays silent --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             No matter.

                   He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             You will soon tell me willingly
                             enough.

                   He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,
                   pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
                             only remaining indigenous life form;
                             what do you think? They've killed
                             twenty of my people, including my
                             beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
                             and not instantly, to be sure. Their
                             young enter through the ears and wrap
                             themselves around the cerebral cortex.
                             This has the effect of rendering the
                             victim extremely susceptible to
                             suggestion. Later, as they grow,
                             follows madness, paralysis -- and
                             death. These are pets, of course --
                             not quite domesticated.

                   As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;
                   he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
                   martinis --

 CHEKOV                              Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk
                             was only doing his duty! You --

 26 CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN 26 KHAN                              There is some pain at first, I am
                             told, and then the effects are quite
                             benign -- until the end. That was
                             what I learned from watching my wife.

                   At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled
                   shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across
                   the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-
                   stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
                   There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
                   dazed calm.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             That's better! Now: tell me why
                             you are here -- and tell me where I
                             may find James Kirk.

                             This is Reliant; please respond.

                   No answer -- Beach makes up his mind --

 BEACH                              Mr. Kyle, muster a landing party

                             down.

                   He heads for the door but is stopped by:

                             all right?

                             Everything's fine, commander. I'll
                             explain when I see you. Oh, by the 
                             way, we're bringing several guests
                             aboard. Prepare to beam up on my
                             next signal. Terrell out.

                   Beach and Kyle look at each other.

 KYLE                              Guests?

 BEACH                              Maybe we ARE transplanting something.

                   A SPACE SHUTTLE moving toward us.

 29 INT. SPACE SHUTTLE 29 
                   A new composite. Bones, Sulu, Uhura and Kirk -- who
                   sits, reading. Through the windows we can see the
                   approach to the starship ENTERPRISE. Kirk looks up,
                   nods. Sulu activates a comm button.

 SULU                              Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
                             party on final approach.

 ENTERPRISE VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             Enterprise welcomes you. Prepare 
                             for docking.

                   Kirk looks up from his book as Sulu sits next to him.

 KIRK                              I really must thank you.

 SULU                                      (embarrassed)
                             I am delighted; any chance to go
                             aboard Enterprise, however briefly,
                             is always an excuse for nostalgia.

 KIRK                              I cut your new orders personally. By
                             the end of the month, you'll have your
                             first command: USS EXCELSIOR.

 SULU                              Thank you, sir. I've looked
                             forward to this for a long time.

 KIRK                              You've earned it. But I'm still
                             grateful to have you at the helm
                             for three weeks. I don't believe
                             these kids can steer.

                   Sulu laughs.

                   The shuttle approaches the mammoth airstrip. As we
                   near the ship, a few WORK CREWS IN SPACE flit about
                   her hull, working.

 32 INT. ENTERPRISE DOCKING BAY 32 
                   A reception group awaits, led by Captain Spock. Saavik
                   stands at his side, in company of the Trainee crew.
                   Also present: CHIEF ENGINEER MR. SCOTT and members of
                   his staff in their distinctive uniforms.

 INTERCOM VOICE                              Docking procedure complete.

 SPOCK                              Prepare for Admiral's inspection.

                   The group comes to attention.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Open the Air Lock.

                   The doors open. Kirk and his staff are piped aboard
                   by an electronic version of the boatswain's tradi-
                   tional whistle. Kirk salutes the Federation symbol
                   and steps forward to exchange salutes with Spock.

 KIRK                              Permission to come aboard, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe
                             you know my trainee crew. Certainly
                             they have come to know you.

 KIRK                                      (dryly to Saavik)
                             Yes, we've been through death and
                             life together.

                   Saavik stiffens slightly -- humor is not her forte.

 KIRK                                      (continuing to Scotty)
                             Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're
                             well?

 SCOTTY                              I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy
                             pulled me through.

 KIRK                              Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?

                   Uncomfortable, Scotty exchanges a glance with Bones --

 BONES                              Shore leave, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Ah.

                   He stops before a BRIGHT-FACED FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD, stand-
                   ing so stiff he looks like he'll break -- in an
                   engineer's uniform.

 KIRK                                     (continuing)
                             And who is this?

 PRESTON                                      (breathless)
                             Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
                             engineers mate, SIR.

                   A big salute. Kirk is amused, returns the salute.

 KIRK                              Your first training voyage, Mr.
                             Preston?

 PRESTON                              Yes, SIR.

 KIRK                              I see. Well, shall we start with
                             the engine room?

                   He moves, followed by his staff.

 SCOTTY                                      (eyeing his protg)
                             I believe you'll find all in order --

 SPOCK                              We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Very good, Mr. Spock.

                   Kirk and party leave. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON SPOCK AND
 SAAVIK. 
 SAAVIK                              He's not what I expected, Sir.

 SPOCK                              What did you expect, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                                      (uncertain)
                             He's very human.

 SPOCK                              We can't all be perfect, Saavik.
                             You must control your prejudices
                             and remember that as a Vulcan as
                             well as a Romulan you are forever
                             a stranger in an alien land.
                             Around you are humans, and as a
                             member of the Starfleet you are
                             unlikely ever to escape their
                             presence or their influence.
                             You must learn to tolerance in addition
                             to all else I have taught you.
                             Tolerance is logical.

                   Saavik is humbled.

 SAAVIK                              As always, my mentor. Company dismiss.

                   The inspection party dwarfed by the size. Silence as
                   Kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc.
                   Scotty, his team and Preston, stand at attention.

                   of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train-
                   ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the
                   responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston.

 PRESTON                                       (blurting)
                             I believe you'll find everything
                             shipshape, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (sternly puts
                                      him on)
                             Oh do you? Have you any idea,
                             Midshipman Preston, how many times
                             I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on
                             the Comm, telling me his troubles?
                             Have you any idea the ribbing I've
                             had to endure in the officers' mess
                             to the effect that the Enterprise
                             is a flying death trap?

 PRESTON                                      (scandalized)
                             Oh, no, sir! This is the finest
                             engine room in the whole Star --

                   The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's
                   face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused.

 PRESTON                                      (continuing)
                             If the Admiral can't see the facts
                             for himself, then, with all due
                             respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion
                             bat. SIR.

                   Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused.

 KIRK                              Midshipman, you're a tiger.

 SCOTTY                              My sister's youngest, Admiral.
                             Crazy to get to space.

 KIRK                              Every young boy's fancy. I seem
                             to remember it myself.
                                     (brisk)
                             Very well. Mr. Scott, are your
                             engines capable of handling a minor
                             training cruise?

 SCOTTY                              Give the word, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Mr. Scott, the word is given.

 SCOTTY                              Aye, sir.

                   He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last
                   salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.

 BONES                                      (dry)

                             inspection, Admiral?

 KIRK                              The inspection will continue once
                             we're underway, Doctor.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 SPOCK                              Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

                   Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik:

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, how many times have you
                             piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

 SAAVIK                              Never, sir.

                   Kirk tries to conceal his reaction. Spock enjoys it.

 SPOCK                              Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

                   Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at
                   the console -- Spock looks at Kirk.

 SPOCK                              There's a first time for everything,
                             Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (casual)
                             To be sure, Captain.

                   They all stifle their responses. Kirk is like a father
                   watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.

 SAAVIK                              Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

 SULU                              Aft thrusters, sir.

 SAAVIK                              Course heading, Captain?

                   Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk.

 KIRK                              Captain's discretion.

                   Spock digests this with a slight smile.

                   Khan occupies the Captain's chair. We PULL BACK: the
                   crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol-
                   lowers in their odd-looking clothes.

                   At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the
                   largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in
                   the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console.
                   Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation,
                   symptoms of their mind-controlled state.

 JOACHIM                              Steady on course. All systems normal.

 KHAN                              It's not much different from
                             Enterprise.

                             When I was a guest aboard her some
                             years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed
                             me to memorize her technical manuals.
                             And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:
                             You say you have no details of
                             Project 'Genesis' ?

 CHEKOV                              Beyond what I told you, sir, it is
                             classified information.

 KHAN                              Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have
                             access to such information?

 CHEKOV                              I would think so, sir. He's on the
                             Fleet General Staff.

 KHAN                              Then to whom do you report directly
                             regarding Genesis?

 CHEKOV                              To Doctor Marcus, the civilian
                             director of the experiments on Space
                             Laboratory Regula I.

 KHAN                                      (thinks)
                             I see. Helmsman?

 HELMSMAN                              Aye, sir.

 JOACHIM                              May I speak? We're all with you,
                             sir, but consider: we are free,
                             we have a ship and the means to
                             go where we will. We have
                             escaped permanent exile on Ceti
                             Alpha V. You have proved your
                             superior intellect and defeated
                             the plans of Admiral Kirk.
                             You do not need to defeat him
                             again.

 KHAN                              He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll
                             chase him round the moons of Nibia
                             and round the Antares maelstrom and
                             round perdition's flames before I give
                             him up.
                                     (as no one speaks)
                             Prepare to alter course -- for Space

                   Huge and busy. Among the scientists going about their
                   tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense;
                   MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and
                   earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer
                   console.

 DAVID                              Does that about do it?

 CAROL                              I don't think there's another piece
                             of information we could squeeze
                             into the memory banks. Next
                             time, we'll design a bigger
                             one.

 DAVID                              Who --

                   Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps.

 JEDDA                              Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel
                             ... It's Reliant.

                   Carol moves forward as the others close in.

 CAROL                              On the screen, please, Jedda.

                   Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles
                   on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.

 CHEKOV                              ... come in, please. This is Reliant
                             calling Regula I. Repeat. This is
                             USS Reliant --

 CAROL                              Commander, we are receiving. This
                             is Regula I. Go ahead.

 CHEKOV                              Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route
                             to you and should be there in three
                             days.

 CAROL                              En route? Why? We weren't expecting
                             you for another three months. Has
                             something happened?
                                     (pause)
                             Has something happened? Do you read 
                             us?

 CHEKOV                                      (fractional pause)
                             All went well. Nothing has happened.
                             Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

                   Pleased reaction from the scientists.

 CAROL                              I still don't under --

 CHEKOV                              We have received new orders. Upon our
                             arrival at Regula I, all materials of
                             Project Genesis will be transferred to
                             this ship for immediate testing at
                             Ceti Alpha VI.

                   Consternation in the lab. David is livid -- the words
                   "Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet!
                                     (back to console)
                             Commander Chekov, this is completely
                             irregular. Who gave the order you
                             are quoting? Who gave the order?

 CHEKOV                                      (still smiling)
                             The order comes from Starfleet
                             command, Dr. Marcus, direct from
                             the General Staff.

 CAROL                              But Genesis is a civilian project,
                             under my control --

 CHEKOV                              I have my orders.

 DAVID                              Pin him down, mother! Who gave the
                             orders!?

                   Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off
                   the monitor.

 CHEKOV                              The orders come from Admiral James
                             T. Kirk.

                   Sensation in the lab.

 DAVID                              I knew it! I knew it! All along
                             the military has wanted to get their
                             hands on this --

                   He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand
                   away and communicates herself.

 CAROL                              This is completely improper,
                             Commander Chekov. I have no
                             intention of allowing Reliant or
                             any other unauthorized personnel
                             access to our work or materials.

 CHEKOV                                      (pauses; listens)
                             I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.
                             Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
                             Please prepare to deliver Genesis to
                             us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

                   The image fades.

 CAROL                              Commander Chekov -- !

                   Chekov, in a matched cut, turns away as CAMERA WIDENS

 KHAN                              Well done, Commander.

 CHEKOV                              You realize, sir, that they will
                             attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and
                             confirm the order.

                   Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.

 49 INT. REGULA I LAB 49 
                   Everyone is talking at once.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet! We must
                             have order here.
                                     (as they subside)
                             This has to be some sort of mistake.

 DAVID                              Mistake? We're all alone here.
                             They waited until everyone was on
                             shift-leave to do this. Reliant is
                             supposed to be at our disposal, not
                             vice-versa.

 MADISON                              It seems clear that Starfleet never
                             intended that --

 CAROL                              I know, but --

 DAVID                              I've tried to warn you. Scientists
                             are always pawns of the military --

 CAROL                                      (angry)
                             Starfleet has kept the peace for
                             a hundred years, I cannot and
                             will not subscribe to your 
                             interpretation of this event.

                   Silence.

 JEDDA                                      (Deltan cool)
                             You may be right, Doctor, but what
                             about Reliant? She's on her way.

                   Carol reacts: this is certainly true.

 CAROL                              Get your gear together where it's
                             handy.

 MARCH                              Where are we going? 

 CAROL                              That's for us to know and Reliant
                             to find out. We have only three
                             days. Let's not waste time.

                   They split off in different directions as ordered.

                   Kirk waits for the Turbo Lift, which opens at last. As
                   he gets in --

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              Hold please -- !

                   Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in. She is surprised to
                   see him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Kirk nods, the doors close. There is an uneasy forced
                   intimacy between them.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, are you wearing your
                             hair differently?

 SAAVIK                              It is still regulation, Admiral.

                   She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             May I speak, sir?

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, self-expression does not
                             seem to be one of your problems.

 SAAVIK                              I wish to thank you for the high 
                             efficiency rating.

 KIRK                              You earned it.

 SAAVIK                              I did not think so.

 KIRK                              You're bothered by your performance
                             on the Kobayashi Maru.

 SAAVIK                              I failed to resolve the situation.

 KIRK                              There is no correct resolution.
                             It is a test of character.

 SAAVIK                              May I ask how you dealt with the
                             test?

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             You may ask, Lieutenant.

                   She stares.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             That was a little joke.

 SAAVIK                              Humor... that is a difficult concept
                             ... it is not logical...

 KIRK                              We learn by doing, Lieutenant.

                   She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the
                   elevator starts.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             You want my advice?

                   She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the
                   attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle
                   it.

 SAAVIK                              Yes.

 KIRK                              Take the test again.

                   The lift stops and the doors open.

                   He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely.

 SAAVIK                              Thank you, sir.

                   Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the
                   ceiling.

 BONES                              Has she changed her hairstyle?

                   Kirk says nothing.

 BONES                                      (finally)
                             Wonderful stuff, that Romulan
                             ale --

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Admiral Kirk --

 KIRK                              Kirk here.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              I have an urgent CommPic from Space

 KIRK                              In my quarters, Uhura.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Yes, sir.

                   Awkward silence.

 BONES                              It never rains but when it pours --

 KIRK                              As a physician you of all people
                             should appreciate the danger of
                             re-opening old wounds.

                   The elevator stops. Kirk leaves. The doors close.

                   Featuring VIEW SCREEN: A scramble of interference and
                   noise. A piece of Carol's VOICE breaks through now
                   and again as we PULL BACK revealing a frustrated Kirk.

 KIRK                              Uhura. Can't you augment?

 UHURA                              I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

                   Carol's face appears. The image will never be stable
                   for long; sometimes the sound will be covered.

 CAROL                              Jim... read me? Can you read me?

 KIRK                              Message breaking up, Carol. What's

 KIRK                              Repeat... what's wrong? What's
                             wrong?

 KIRK                              Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking

 KIRK                              What order? Who's taking Genesis?

 CAROL                              ... Please help us, Jim... won't

                   But the picture is irrevocably scrambled now. Kirk
                   pounds the Comm in frustration.

 KIRK                              Uhura! What's happening? Damn
                             it...

                   The activity is normal. The Turbo-Lift opens and Kirk
                   strides in. Bones and Saavik react to the following:

 KIRK                              Stop engines.

 SULU                              Stop engines.

                   They look wonderingly. Kirk takes a breath --

 KIRK                              An emergency situation has arisen.
                             By order of Starfleet Command, as
                             of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming
                             command of this vessel. Duty officer

                             Mr. Scott?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Aye, sir.

 KIRK                              Mr. Sulu, go to Warp 5.

                   Sulu does, and with a great thrust of energy --

                   The ship accelerates, and then, with an eye-filled
                   burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing.

 57A INT. SPOCK'S QUARTERS 57A 
                   Spock is at meditation as Kirk enters quietly. Spock
                   looks up.

 KIRK                              We've got a problem.

                   Spock raises an eyebrow --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Something may be wrong at Regula
                             I. We've been ordered to investigate.

 SPOCK                              Regula I is a scientific research
                             laboratory, if memory serves...

 KIRK                              I told Starfleet all we had was a
                             boatload of children but we're the
                             only ship in the quadrant. Spock:
                             those cadets of yours -- how good
                             are they? How will they respond
                             under real pressure?

 SPOCK                              Like all living beings, Admiral
                             each according to his gifts. The
                             ship is yours.

 KIRK                              That won't be necessary: just take
                             me to Regula I.

 SPOCK                              Excuse my presumption, but I do not
                             agree. As a teacher on a training
                             mission, I am content to command a
                             Starship. If we are to go on actual
                             duty, it is clear that the senior
                             officer aboard must assume command.

 KIRK                              But it may be nothing; garbled
                             communications. Why don't you...

 SPOCK                              You proceed from a false assumption.
                             I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

                   Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.

 KIRK                              You are going to remind me that
                             logic alone dictates your actions.

 SPOCK                              I was going to remind you of nothing,
                             least of all that which you know well.
                                     (pause)
                             Your mistake, if I may be so bold,
                             was promotion. Commanding a Starship
                             is your first best destiny. Anything
                             else is a waste of material.

 KIRK                              I would not presume to debate you.

 SPOCK                              That is wise. In any case, were I
                             to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
                             that the needs of the many outweigh
                             the needs of the few.

 KIRK                              Or the one.

                   Spock inclines his head.

 SPOCK                              You are my superior officer. You
                             are also my friend. I have been
                             and always shall be yours.

                   Kirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally:

 KIRK                              Will you accompany me to the bridge?

 SPOCK                              I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first
                             so that he may, in his own words,
                             explain the situation to his cadets.

                   Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice.

                             Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please.
                             Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please
                             -- it's no use; no response from
                             Regula I.

 SPOCK                              But no longer jammed?

 UHURA                              No, sir. No nothing.

                   Spock considers, moves to Kirk.

 SPOCK                              There are two possibilities, sir
                             they are unwilling to respond, they
                             are unable to respond.

 KIRK                              How far?

 SPOCK                              Twelve hours and forty-three
                             minutes, present speed.

 KIRK                              Give up Genesis, she said. What in
                             God's name does that mean? Give it
                             up to whom?

 SPOCK                              It might help my analysis if I knew
                             what Genesis was.

                   Kirk looks at him, nods; rising now.

 KIRK                              Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in
                             my quarters. Mr. Saavik, take the

 65 CAROL 65                              It is our intention to introduce
                             what we call the Genesis device
                             or "torpedo" into the targeted
                             area of a lifeless space body,
                             a moon or other inert form --
                             the device is fired --

                   react with wonder.

 CAROL                              -- Unleashing, almost instantan-
                             eously, what we call the Genesis
                             effect. Particulate matter is
                             reorganized and electrified --
                             with life introduced results.
                             Instead of a dead moon, a living
                             breathing planet, capable of sus-
                             taining whatever life forms we
                             see fit to deposit on it... The
                             reformed object you see represents
                             the merest fraction of the Genesis
                             potential, should the Federation
                             wish to pursue these experiments to
                             their logical conclusion.

 67A BACK TO CAROL IN LAB 67A 
 CAROL                              When we consider the problems of
                             population and food supply, the
                             usefulness of this process begins
                             to become clear.
                             This concludes this demonstration
                             tape. Thank you for your attention.
                             The Genesis team eagerly awaits the
                             decision of the Federation regarding
                             the next phase of our work.

                   The tape becomes snowy and blinks off.

                   Kirk looks at Bones and Spock -- they are stunned.

 SPOCK                              It literally is Genesis...

 KIRK                              The power of creation --

 SPOCK                              Have they proceeded with their
                             experiments?

 KIRK                              The tape was made a year ago. I
                             can only assume they've reached
                             Phase Two by now --

 BONES                              But dear Lord, are we intelligent
                             enough to -- Suppose, this
                             thing were used where life already
                             exists?

 SPOCK                              It would destroy such life in favor
                             of its new matrix --

 BONES                              It's new -- have you any idea what
                             you're saying?

 SPOCK                              I was not attempting to evaluate
                             its moral implications, Doctor.
                             As a matter of cosmic history, it
                             has always been easier to destroy
                             than to create --

 BONES                              Not anymore! Now you can do both
                             at the same time! According to myth,
                             the earth was created in six days.
                             Watch out: here comes Genesis;
                             we'll do it for you in six minutes --

 SPOCK                              I don't dispute that in the wrong
                             hands --

 BONES                              Would you like to tell me whose
                             are the right hands, my cold-blooded
                             friend? Are you in favor of these
                             experiments?

 KIRK                              Gentlemen, this isn't --

 SPOCK                              Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban
                             the acquisition of knowledge
                             because you distrust the moral
                             implications of what you learn.
                             Logic suggests --

 BONES                              Logic?? We're talking about
                             universal Armageddon, you inhuman
                             bloodless...

                             Admiral, sensors indicate a vessel
                             in our area, closing fast.

 KIRK                              What do you make of her?

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              It's one of ours, Admiral... It's
                             Reliant.

 SPOCK                              What's she doing here?

 KIRK                              Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?

 68 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 68 
                   The whoosh of the turbo doors and Kirk, Bones and
                   Spock assume their posts. Saavik stands next to Kirk's
                   chair.

 UHURA                              She's not responding...

 KIRK                              Try the emergency channels...

 UHURA                              Enterprise to Reliant. Come in,
                             Reliant.

 UHURA                              Yes, sir.

 KIRK                              Is it possible their COMM system
                             has failed -- ?

 SPOCK                              It would explain a great many things --

 JOACHIM                              They're still running with shields down.

 KHAN                              Of course. We're one big happy fleet.
                             Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know
                             the Klingon proverb that tells us
                             revenge is a dish that is best

 UHURA                              I'm getting a voice message... wait

 KIRK                              Spock?

 SPOCK                              Scanning...

                   He steps to his station.

                   The two ships are very close, barely moving as they inch

                   Khan is half out of his seat, sweating with anticipation.

 KHAN                              Careful: Not all at once. The

                   Reliant firing phasers at Enterprise. A hit in the rear

 77 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 77 
                   An explosion rips through the facility, sending yellow-

                   And he puts his own respirator on, as do some of the

 81 HIGH ANGLE - ENGINE ROOM 81 
                   The angle we saw during inspection. The trainees, in
                   panic amid the gas crawl over each other trying to get
                   out. They scramble over each other's shoulders in the

                   Scotty's voice is faint, drowned by the screams and
                   cries from a dozen intercom stations.

                   to put out electrical fires, help the fallen --

                   The firefighting continues.

 KIRK                              Scotty -- what's left?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Just the batteries, sir. I can have
                             auxiliary power in a few minutes --

 KIRK                              We don't have minutes. Can you
                             give me phaser power?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              A few shots, sir.

 SPOCK                              Not enough against their shields.

 KIRK                              Who the hell are they?

 UHURA                              Admiral... Commander Reliant is
                             signaling.
                                     (a pause)
                             He wishes to discuss terms of our
                             surrender.

                   There is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered
                   bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's.

 KIRK                              On screen.

 UHURA                                      (hesitating)
                             Admiral --

 KIRK                              Do it, while we have time.

                   All eyes go to the SCREEN. After momentary visual
                   confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; dumbfounded)
                             Khan!

 SAAVIK                              Who?

 KHAN                              You still remember, Admiral. I
                             cannot help but be touched. Of
                             course, I remember you.

 KIRK                              What is the meaning of this attack?
                             Where is the crew of the Reliant?

 KHAN                              Surely I have made my meaning plain.
                             I mean to avenge myself upon you,
                             Admiral. I've deprived your ship of
                             power and when I swing round I mean
                             to deprive you of your life --

                             -- But I wanted you to know first
                             who it was who had beaten you: I,
                             Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you
                             attempted to cage forever.

 KIRK                              Khan, listen to me -- if its me you
                             want, I'll have myself beamed aboard.
                             All I ask is that you spare my crew.

 KHAN                              That is a most intriguing offer.
                             Typical, I must say of your sterling
                             character. Let me think.

                             agree to your terms, if in addition
                             to yourself, you turn over to me all
                             data and material regarding the
                             project called Genesis.

                   Reactions from Spock and Kirk.

 KIRK                              Genesis, what's that?

 KHAN                              Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is
                             on the phaser control --

 KIRK                              Give me some time to recall the data
                             on our computers --

 KHAN                              I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

                   Kirk turns from the screen --

 SPOCK                              Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

 KIRK                              At least we know he hasn't got it.
                             Just keep nodding as though I'm
                             giving orders. Saavik, punch up the
                             data charts of Reliant's command
                             console -- hurry...

 KIRK                              It's all we've got.

 SAAVIK                              On screen...

                             give us time -- the bridge is
                             smashed, computers inoperative...

 KHAN                              Time is a luxury you do not have,

 KIRK                              You've got to learn WHY things
                             work on a Starship.

                             It's coming through now, Khan...

                             Let's hope he hasn't changed the
                             combination. He's quite intelligent...

 KIRK                                      (grim)
                             Wait for my signal, Spock -- too
                             soon and he'll have time to figure
                             it out and raise them again.

                   Spock nods; Kirk turns to the screen --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Khan, how do I know you'll keep
                             your word?

 KHAN                                      (on screen)
                             I've given you no word to keep,
                             Admiral. In my judgment, you simply
                             have no alternative.

 KIRK                              I take your point. Stand by to
                             receive our transmission.

                   He turns from the screen again, softly:

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target
                             and await my command...

                             Phasers locked...

                   They're all sweating.

 KHAN                              Time's up, Admiral...

 JOACHIM                              We can't fire, sir; they've damaged
                             the photon controls and the warp

                             I did nothing -- except get caught
                             with my britches down. I must be

                   Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face;
                   he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them

                   MANY CASUALTIES IN EVIDENCE. Kirk enters and LEADS
                   CAMERA THROUGH them; he has a word or two for men he
                   doesn't know by name. Kirk leads us to the operating
                   theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands
                   by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees
                   Scotty and Kirk.

                             Is the word given?

                             The word is given: warp speed.

 PRESTON                                      (almost smiles)
                             Aye...

                   He dies. Pause. Scotty looks across the body at Kirk.

 SCOTTY WHY? 
 KIRK                                      (looks at Preston)
                             He wants to kill me for passing

                             he doesn't care who stands between
                             him and his vengeance.

 BONES                              Scotty, I'm sorry...

 SCOTTY                              He stayed at his post. When the
                             trainees ran, he stayed.

 KIRK                                      (thinks)
                             Best speed to Regula I. Kirk
                             out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any
                             chance of getting the mains back on
                             the line?

 SCOTTY                              I dinna think so, sir, but you'll
                             have my best --

                   With an effort, he gets to his feet --

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor...

                   Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR
                   the sound of impulse power taking effect.

 KIRK                              Are you all right?

                   Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston.

 BONES                              Doctors lose patients sometimes.
                             Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd
                             he know about Genesis?

 KIRK                              At the moment that question takes
                             a back seat to preventing him from
                             laying his hands on it. You said it
                             yourself; we're talking about a bang
                             that would re-arrange the universe...

 BONES                              There may still be time... you gave
                             as good as you got.

 KIRK                                      (looks him in the eye)
                             I got beat. We're only alive because
                             I knew something about these ships
                             that he didn't.

                   He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at
                   Preston.

 107 EXT. SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION 107 
                   Regula, the dead planet beyond.

 108 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE 108 
                   Approaching. As she moves slowly PAST CAMERA, WE PAN
                   WITH her TO SEE that she is approaching the space lab.

 109 INT. BRIDGE - ENTERPRISE 109 
                   Battle damage, some repaired, some not. The bridge is
                   filled with tension, all hands at station.

 SULU (V.O.)                              Approaching Regula and Space Lab
                             Regula I.

 KIRK                              Try again.

 UHURA                              Space Station Regular I, this is
                             Starship Enterprise. Come in, please...

 110 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB - ON SCREEN 110 
                   As before, Uhura's image, imploring a response.

 UHURA                              I say again. Space Station Regular.
                             This is Starship Enterprise. Please
                             respond. Please respond.

                   During this, CAMERA HAS PANNED CLOSE AMONG the techni-
                   cal clutter. Then suddenly. SOUND -- eerie, frightening.
                   Our ears cannot place it... and before we can, it is gone
                   a warning.

 111 BACK TO BRIDGE 111 
 UHURA                              ... No response, sir.

 KIRK                              Sensors, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Scanners and sensors still inoperative.
                             There's no way to tell what's  inside
                             the station.

 KIRK                              And no way of knowing if Reliant
                             is still in the area...

 SPOCK                              Affirmative, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (with irony)
                             ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat.
                             What do you make of the plantoid
                             beyond?

 SPOCK                              Regula is class "D'. It consists of
                             various remarkable ores. Essentially,
                             a great rock in space.

 KIRK                              Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.

 SPOCK                              A distinct possibility.

 KIRK                              Engine room... Scotty, do we have
                             enough power for the transporters?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Just barely, sir.

 KIRK                                      (the decision)
                             I'm going down to the station.

                   He starts out. Bones stops him.

 BONES                              Khan could be down there!

 KIRK                              He's BEEN there and hasn't found
                             what he wants. Can you spare
                             someone? There may be people
                             hurt.

 BONES                              I can spare me...

 SAAVIK                              Begging the Admiral's pardon:
                             General Order 15: 'No  flag officer
                             shall beam into a hazardous area
                             without armed escort.'

 KIRK                              There is no such regulation.

                   Saavik's gaze falters --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             All right, join the party.
                             Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

 SPOCK                              Aye sir --

 KIRK                              Establish a parking orbit around
                             the station and send me a complete
                             damage report when you've talked
                             with Mr. Scott.

 SPOCK                              Be careful, Jim...

                   Kirk, Bones and Saavik head for the turbo doors.

 112 EXT. SPACE - SPACE STATION REGULAR I 112 
                   CLOSER ANGLE now. The silence is ominous.

 113 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB 113 
                   empty, except for the hums and crackles of abandoned
                   equipment. With a FAMILIAR SOUND, BONES, KIRK and
                   SAAVIK MATERIALIZE. All have phasers, communicators
                   and tricorders.

                   For a moment they look around, seeing emptiness. Like
                   being in a haunted house.

 KIRK                              Hello...! Anybody here?

                   A WEIRD ECHO reverberates his cries.

 SAAVIK                                      (raises tricorder)
                             Indeterminate life signs.

 KIRK                              Phasers on stun. Move out.

                   They separate. Each begins to search.

 114 ANGLE WITH SAAVIK 114 
                   She moves to the electronic and data area, examines the
                   consoles, the equipment, then settles for the data bank.
                   She starts keying sequences with the computer.

 115 INT. SPACE STATION - BONES 115 
                   He shows signs of fear as he walks through the deserted
                   place, like a scuba diver exploring a cave. We want
                   him to go back.

                   A NOISE. Bones reacts with brave apprehension.

                   Rounding a corner, he starts: A RAT scuttles right in
                   front of him.

                   Bones sighs with relief and moves forward. We think
                   he's safe.

                   SUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE: an upside
                   down human ARM.

 116 SAME LOCALE - LATER 116 
                   Kirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five BODIES
                   from where they were hanged, upside down.

                   Having recovered his composure, Bones examines the
                   corpses. We RECOGNIZE Madison, March, among others.

                   One is clearly the COOK.

 KIRK                                      (stunned)
                             They even killed the galley chief.

 BONES                              This one looks like a Steward.
                             They're not warm, but rigor hasn't
                             set in. This didn't happen all that
                             long ago, Jim.

                   Kirk looks around, despairingly --

 KIRK                              Carol...

 117 INT. SPACE LAB DATA BANK 117 
                   WITH SAAVIK working with console. Something puzzles
                   her. She frowns, but a NEW SOUND distracts her. She
                   looks up and moves off.

 118 FULL SHOT - IN THE LAB 118 
                   A moan is heard. All three now converge on the area.
                   As they near it, Saavik's tricorder hums furiously. Be
                   this a room, a locker of some other place, this time
                   they -- "open the door." The limp bodies of Chekov and
                   Terrell fall out.

 UHURA'S VOICE                                      (on screen)
                             Admiral Kirk, Enterprise. Come in,
                             please. Come in please.

                   She will continue sporadically.

 KIRK                              My God!

                   Chekov emits a live, reassuring moan.

 BONES                              That's Clark Terrell, Jim, I've
                             served with him.

                   Bones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Brain disturbance. Appears to be
                             drug induced.

                   He reaches into his kit. He shoots Chekov moves off
                   to Terrell. Uhura, voice continues in the b.g.

 KIRK                              Saavik, for God's sake, tell her
                             we're all right.

 119 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FAVORING UHURA 119 
 UHURA                              I say again. This is Enterprise.
                             Please acknowledge signal. Please --

                   Saavik's face appears on her screen.

 SAAVIK                                      (on screen, hurried)
                             Commander Uhura, this is Lt. Saavik.
                             We're all right. Please stand by.
                             Out.

 UHURA                                      (baffled)
                             Aye, aye.

 120 INT. SPACE STATION - TIGHT GROUP 120 
                   Chekov opens his eyes, and stares into Kirk's.

 CHEKOV                              Oh, God, Admiral...!

                   He weeps like a child, and Kirk holds him. Meanwhile,
                   Terrell opens his eyes and stares at Bones.

 BONES                              It's Dr. McCoy, Captain. Do you
                             remember me?

 TERRELL                              McCoy? Yes. Oh, yes.

 121 ANGLE FAVORING CHEKOV AND KIRK 121 
                   Chekov breaks the embrace in high relief and anxiety.

 CHEKOV                              Oh, sir. It was Khan! We found him
                             on Ceti Alpha V.

 KIRK                              Easy, Pavel... Tell me what you
                             can...

 CHEKOV                              No life signs -- but he was there.
                             Captured us. He -- he put creatures
                             in our bodies. To control our minds.

                   Bones takes over Chekov --

 BONES                              It's all right, you're safe...

 CHEKOV                              ... Made us say -- lies... Do...
                             things... But we beat him... The
                             Captain and me. -- He thought he
                             controlled us, but he didn't ...
                             The Captain was strong.

                   Chekov breaks into tears. Kirk looks at Terrell, who is
                   more composed.

 KIRK                              Captain. Where is Dr. Marcus?
                             Where are the Genesis materials?

 TERRELL                              He couldn't find them. Some of
                             the scientists were still here,
                             but everything else, even the data
                             banks -- were empty.

 SAAVIK                              That's true, Admiral. All the
                             memory cells have been emptied.

 KIRK                                      (ponders)
                             Erased...

 TERRELL                              He tortured those people. None of
                             them would tell him anything. He
                             went wild, strung them up and slit
                             their throats. He wanted to tear
                             the place apart, but he was late:
                             he had to get back to Reliant in
                             time to blow you to bits.

 KIRK                              He came damn close...

 CHEKOV                              He left us.
                                     (with irony)
                             We were no longer of use.
 SAAVIK                              Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?

 TERRELL                              Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's
                             completely mad, Admiral. He blames
                             you for the death of his wife...

 KIRK                              I know what he blames me for.
                                     (thinks)
                             The escape pods are all in place.
                                     (looks around)
                             Where's the transporter room?

 122 INT. SPACE STATION TRANSPORTER ROOM 122 
                   Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter
                   consoles. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the transporter pods,
                   and the others, b.g.

 KIRK                              Did he make it down here?

                   Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit
                   stronger.

 CHEKOV                              It was not my impression. He spent
                             most of his time trying to wring the
                             information out of the people.

                   Saavik approaches Kirk:

 SAAVIK                              Anything?

                   Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

 KIRK                              Somebody left the unit on. If
                             everyone else was dead, it implies
                             that no one remained to turn it off.
                             Those people back there bought escape
                             time for Genesis with their lives.

                   Saavik studies the console.

 SAAVIK                              It doesn't make sense. These
                             coordinates are well within
                             Regula -- a plantoid we know to be
                             lifeless and airless.

 KIRK                                      (wheels turn)
                             If Stage Two was completed, it was
                             underground -- she said it was going
                             to be underground.

 SAAVIK                              Stage Two of what?

                   Kirk gets it.

 KIRK                                      (on communicator)
                             Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Admiral, if we go by the book, like
                             Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem
                             like days.

 KIRK                                      (beat)
                             I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

                   Fractional pause.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              The situation is grave, Admiral. We
                             won't have main power for six days
                             at least. Auxiliary power has
                             temporarily failed, but maybe we can
                             restore that in two days. By the
                             book, Admiral.

                   Kirk frowns.

 KIRK                              Meaning you can't even beam us back?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Not at present.

                   Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides --

 KIRK                              Captain Spock, if you do not hear
                             from us within one hour your orders
                             are to restore what power you can,
                             take the Enterprise to the nearest
                             Star Base and alert Starfleet
                             command when you are out of jamming
                             range.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

 KIRK                              Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
                             there won't be anybody behind. Kirk
                             out.
                                     (to Terrell and Chekov)
                             You gentleman can remain here, or...

 TERRELL                              If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd
                             like to share the risk.

 KIRK                                      (hesitates)
                             Very well. Let's go.

 BONES                              Go? Where are we going?

 KIRK                                      (points to console)
                             Where they went. Saavik.

                   Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console,
                   rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

 BONES                              But what if they went -- nowhere?

 KIRK                              Then this will be your big chance
                             to get away from it all.

 SAAVIK                              Ready.

                   She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly
                   they VANISH.

 123 EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA 123 
                   CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
                   with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.
                   The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

 124 INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA 124 
                   The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort-
                   able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then
                   APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral --

                   She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA
                   reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials
                   and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version
                   of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE
 GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.) 
 BONES                              Genesis, I presume.

                   They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very
                   fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to
                   the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.

                   At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their
                   phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has
                   them covered and helpless.

 125 ANGLE FAVORING DAVID 125 
 DAVID                              You're the sonavabitch who
                             committed mass murder up there.

                   He raises the knife --

 KIRK                              I'm Admiral Kirk...

 DAVID                              We were still there, you dumb
                             bastard! We could hear the screams
                             all the way to the transporter room --

                   Again he raises the knife --

 KIRK                              Where's Dr. Marcus --

 DAVID                              I'm Doctor Marcus!

                   Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave --

 CAROL                              David --

 DAVID                              Mother, go back!

                   Carol sees Kirk --

 CAROL                              Jim --

 DAVID                              Go back. I'm going to kill him.

 CAROL                                      (takes a breath)
                             You do that and you'll have murdered
                             your father.

                   All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are
                   turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look
                   at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the
                   phaser from Jedda.

 126 NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134) 126 
 TERRELL                                      (cool)
                             I'll hold onto this.

                   But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each
                   other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches
                   up, trying to smile and touches his hair --

 CAROL                              You've got a little grey --

                   She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look-
                   ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there,
                   stunned, looking back.

 KIRK                              Carol. Is that true?

                   She nods --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Why didn't you tell me?

 DAVID                              She's making it up! My father was
                             Professor --

 CAROL                              David, you're just making this
                             harder --

 TERRELL                              I'm afraid it's even harder than you
                             think, Doctor.

                   He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             Please don't move --

 KIRK                              Chekov -- !

 CHEKOV                              I'm sorry, Admiral.

                   Terrell speaks into his wrist recorder.

 TERRELL                              Your excellency, have you been
                             listening?

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             I have indeed, Captain. You have
                             done well...

 DAVID                              I knew it -- !

                   David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik
                   instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
                   Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --
                   a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS
                   and David reacts with horror and guilt.

                   Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell
                   himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in
                   semi-panic.

 TERRELL                              Don't move -- any of you!

 135 EXT. SPACE - THE DARK SIDE OF REGULA 135 
                   Reliant, motionless in a parking orbit.

 136 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE - FAVORING KHAN 136 
                   Joachim over his shoulder. Others in evidence. Khan
                   speaks into his console.

 KHAN                              Captain... We're waiting. What's
                             the delay?

 137 INT. ROCKY CAVERN (INTERCUT AS DESIRED) 137 
 TERRELL                              All is well, sir. You have the
                             coordinates to beam up Genesis...

 KHAN                              First things first, Captain. Kill
                             Admiral Kirk.

                   Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
                   David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
                   Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting
                   mental signals.

 TERRELL                              Excellency... it is difficult.
                             I try to obey, but --

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Kill him.

                   As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the
                   wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-
                   wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and
                   tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims
                   his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser
                   and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.
                   We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,
                   shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (still emanates from
                                      wrist recorder)
                             Kill him, Terrell. Now.

                   Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

 138 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 138 
                   He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
                   head.

                   Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from
                   his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm. Chekov,
                   almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Terrell? Chekov -- !

 BONES                              Jim -- for God's sake!

                   They rush to his side, as do Carol and David.

 139 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 139 
                   From the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge.

 140 VERY CLOSE - CHEKOV'S EAR 140 
                   The Ceti eel crawls out. It has grown quite large.

 141 SCENE 141 
                   Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel
                   clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,
                   then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

 KIRK                              Khan, you bloodsucker, they're
                             finished! You'll have to do your
                             own dirty work now. Do you hear me?
                             Do you?

 142 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 142 
                   Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He
                   clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

 KHAN                              Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive --
                             my old friend...

 INTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH 
 143 ROCKY CAVERN - FAVORING KIRK 143 
 KIRK                              Still, 'old friend.' You've
                             managed to kill just about everyone
                             else, but like a poor marksman, you
                             keep missing the target.

 KHAN                                      (ironic)
                             Perhaps I no longer need to try.

                   He punches several buttons.

                   In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the
                   Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

                   As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up
                   the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but
                   Saavik holds him fast --

 DAVID                              Let go -- he can't -- !

 SAAVIK                              Only half of you would get there.

                   The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them
                   alone.

 KIRK                                      (desperate)
                             Khan, you have Genesis, but you
                             don't have me! You were going to
                             kill me, Khan, it was your sole
                             purpose. You'll have to come down
                             here to do it! You'll have to
                             come down!

 KHAN'S VOICE                              I've done far worse than kill you,
                             Admiral. I've hurt you. And I
                             wish to go on hurting you. I
                             shall leave you, as you left me --
                             where no one will ever find you:
                             poetic justice; marooned for
                             eternity in the center of a dead
                             planet -- buried alive.

 KIRK                              Khan -- !

 KHAN                              Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't
                             count on Enterprise. She can't
                             move. My next act will be to blow
                             her out of the heavens.

 KHAN                              Well?

 KHAN                              Excellent. We have all the time

 146 INT. ROCKY CAVERN 146 
                   As before, Saavik is on the communicator.

 SAAVIK                              This is Lt. Saavik, calling Enterprise...

                   She keeps trying. Chekov stirs --

 BONES                              He's alive!

                   Bones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up.

 KIRK                              Pavel?

                   Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand --

 SAAVIK                              No use, Admiral, they're still
                             jamming all channels.

 BONES                                      (looks across Chekov)
                             It wouldn't make any difference.
                             If Enterprise obeyed orders she's
                             long since gone. And if she couldn't
                             obey, she's finished.

 DAVID                              So are we, it looks like.

 CAROL                              I don't understand.
                             Who's responsible for all this?
                             Who is Khan?

 KIRK                              It's a long story.

 DAVID                              We appear to have plenty of time.

 BONES                                      (dry)
                             You and your father can catch up on
                             things.

 DAVID                                      (bitter)
                             My father. I hope you realize
                             another man has just been killed
                             because of...

 BONES                              Because of you, son. You shouldn't
                             have tried to rush someone holding
                             a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't
                             one man dead, it's two, in case
                             you've lost count.

                   David has been effectively spiked. Long silence.

 KIRK                              Do you have anything to eat? I
                             don't know about anyone else, but
                             I'm starved.

 BONES                              How can you think of food at a time
                             like this?

 KIRK                              Our first order of business is survival.

 CAROL                              There's food in the Genesis cave,
                             enough to last a lifetime -- should
                             that be necessary.

 BONES                              We thought this was Genesis.

                   Carol laughs -- there's an edge of hysteria to it.

 CAROL                              This? It took the Starfleet corps
                             of engineers ten months in space
                             suits to tunnel out all this. What
                             we did in there -- we did in a day.
                             David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
                             and the Lieutenant our idea of food.

 DAVID                              But we can't just sit here -- !

 KIRK                                      (unruffled)
                             Oh, yes we can. Is there really
                             something to eat?

                   David looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting
                   on his spectacles.

 CAROL                              David. Please.

 DAVID                                      (to Kirk)
                             This is just to give us something
                             to do, isn't it?
                                     (he shrugs)
                             Come on.

                   Saavik and Bones make to follow. Saavik turns to Kirk --

 SAAVIK                              Admiral?

 KIRK                              As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond
                             of saying: I like to think there
                             always are possibilities.

                   Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap,
                   looking at Kirk.

 CAROL                              David was right, wasn't he? It's
                             just to keep them busy.

 KIRK                              Why? Why didn't you tell me?

 CAROL                              How can you ask me that? Were we
                             together? Where we going to be?
                             You had your world and I had mine.
                             I wanted him in mine, not chasing
                             through the universe with his father.

                   Kirk turns away, overcome. She watches him.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He's a lot like you in many ways.
                             Nothing I could do about it. He's
                             smarter, of course; that goes without
                             saying. Most of Genesis is really
                             his.

                   Her joke doesn't take effect. He doesn't turn.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             This is it, isn't it? We're never
                             going to get out of here.

                   Kirk says nothing.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

                   Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he
                   changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks.

 KIRK                              There's a man I haven't seen in
                             fifteen years who thinks he's killed
                             me. You show me a son who'd almost be
                             happy to help him. My son. My life
                             that could have been and wasn't. What
                             am I feeling? I'm feeling old --
                             worn out.

                   Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down
                   on a sweater, then stands.

 CAROL                              Let me show you something that will
                             make you feel young -- young as when
                             the world was new.

                   She offers her hand. Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles,
                   faint assurance.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He'll be all right. Come.

                   After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and
                   she leads him to the tunnel.

 150B INT. TUNNEL 150B 
                   TRUCKING BEFORE Carol and Kirk. A rising light falls
                   on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement
                   toward the source. Kirk races ahead...

                   A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle
                   of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point
                   of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water-
                   falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a
                   round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.
                   There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower
                   level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling
                   to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

                   who watches him.

 DAVID                              What are you looking at?

 SAAVIK                              The Admiral's son.

 DAVID                              Don't you believe it.

 SAAVIK                              Oh, I believe it.

                   She almost smiles. David returns her stare and it
                   throws her.

 BONES                              It's like the Garden of Eden...

 KIRK                              What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

                             out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                              On the test, sir, will you tell me
                             what you did? I'd really like to
                             know.

                   Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles --

 BONES                              Lieutenant, you are looking at the
                             only Starfleet cadet who ever beat
                             the no-win scenario --

 KIRK                              And almost got tossed out of the
                             Academy...

                   He looks at his watch again, using his glasses --

 SAAVIK                              How?

 KIRK                              I reprogrammed the simulation so it
                             was possible to rescue the ship.

 SAAVIK WHAT? 
 KIRK                              I changed the conditions of the
                             test. I received a commendation for
                             original thinking.
                                     (pause)
                             I don't like to lose.

 SAAVIK                              Then -- you never faced that
                             situation -- faced death...

 BONES                              Until now.

 KIRK                              We each face death every day we're
                             alive, Saavik.

                   He picks up the communicator.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours.
                             Are you about ready?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Right on schedule, Admiral. Just
                             give us your coordinates and we'll
                             beam you aboard.

                   The others are on their feet, stunned with amazement --

 KIRK                              Right. I don't like to lose.

                   He clicks off.

                   David gapes at his father.

 160 OMITTED 160 
 161 EXT. SPACE DARK SIDE OF REGULA 161 
                   WE CAN SEE NOW where Enterprise is: she has slipped
                   behind the plantoid, clockwise, even as Reliant was
                   rounding into the lighted side.

 162 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ENTERPRISE 162 
                   Kirk, David, Saavik, Carol and Bones, holding the semi-
                   conscious Chekov MATERIALIZE. Spock is there to greet
                   them.

 SAAVIK                              But the damage report -- we were
                             immobilized...

 KIRK                              Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all
                             people go by the book. Hello,
                             Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...

                   They are moving through the room as they talk --

 SPOCK                              Certainly...

 SAAVIK                                      (overlapping)
                             By the book...

 KIRK                              Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions
                             are being monitored during battle...'

 SAAVIK                              '... no uncoded messages on an open
                             channel...'

                   Saavik steps in front of Spock.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             You lied.

 SPOCK                              I exaggerated.

 KIRK                              Hours instead of days, Saavik; now
                             we have minutes instead of hours --

 BONES                                      (behind)
                             I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.

                   CAMERA STAYS WITH THEM, HOLDS ON DAVID, awed.

 163 INT. CORRIDOR ENTERPRISE 163 
                   Saavik and Kirk follow Spock. They stop at a Turbo
                   Lift --

 SPOCK                              They're inoperative below C-deck.

 164 INT. ANOTHER ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 164 
                   They race down corridors as they speak -- 

 KIRK                              What IS working around here?

 SPOCK                              Not much, Admiral. We have partial
                             main power...

 KIRK                              That's it?

 SPOCK                              Best we could do in two hours.

 165 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 165 
                   Full crew in place as doors whoosh open --

 SULU                                      (overjoyed)
                             Admiral on the bridge --

 KIRK                              Battle stations.

                   ALARMS, SIRENS, ETC. CREW RUSH INTO PLACE AS Kirk,
                   Spock and Saavik approach the big screen.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Tactical.

                   We see the Enterprise emerging from the dark side of
                   Gamma Regula, where Reliant is now a moving blip.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Uh oh.

 SPOCK                              She can out-run us and out-gun us.
                             But there is the Mutara Nebula at
                             153 mark four.

 KIRK                                      (studies his console)
                             Scotty, can we make it inside?

 SCOTTY                              The energizer's bypassed like a
                             Christmas tree -- so don't give me
                             too many bumps.

 KIRK                              No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

 SAAVIK                              Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all
                             that static discharge and gas clouds 
                             our tactical display. Visuals won't 
                             function and shields will be useless.

                   Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they
                   smile with faint amusement.

 SPOCK                              What's sauce for the goose, Mr.
                             Saavik. The odds will be even.

 166 VARIOUS CORRIDORS, ENTERPRISE 166 
                   As the lights change, the CREW runs to their stations.

 166A EXT. SPACE 166A 
 ENTERPRISE STARTS MOVING. 
 167 INT. HOSPITAL 167 
                   Carol, David and Bones react to the light change and
                   the sirens -- Bones works on Chekov...

 DAVID                              I'm going up there.

 BONES                              You'll be in the way, Dr. Marcus...
                             best stay here.

                   Carol and David are civilians on a battleship.

 168 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 168 
                   Reacting. Saavik approaches Kirk and Spock.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral... what happens if Reliant
                             fails to follow us into the nebula?

                   Kirk and Spock exchange looks --

 SPOCK                              I think we can guarantee she'll
                             follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me
                             to explain to you the concept of
                             human ego.

 KIRK                              Best speed, Scotty...

 169 EXT. SPACE 169 
                   The Enterprise whooshes by CAMERA leaving Regula
                   behind. Reliant now appears in far b.g. and CAMERA
                   BEGINS A MOVE to her.

 170 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 170 
 KHAN                              There! Full impulse power! Not
                             so wounded as we were led to believe
                             -- so much the better...

 171 EXT. SPACE 171 
                   Reliant moves to and past CAMERA in hot pursuit.

 172 EXT. SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS 172 
                   Call them SPACE-BYS. Enterprise rushes TOWARD US,
                   flashes BY and CONTINUES towards the swirling nebula.

                   THEN Reliant does the same, closer in pursuit. At
                   this moment, half the distance between Regula and
                   the nebula has been covered.

 173 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 173 
 SPOCK                              Estimating nebula penetration
                             in two minutes. Reliant is
                             closing.

 KIRK                              Steady as you go...

 174 EXT. SPACE 174 
                   Orientation, SHOT. Reliant can clearly see where
                   Enterprise is headed --

 175 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 175 
 JOACHIM                              We'll lose them if they go in there.

 KHAN                              Rake her.

 176 SOMEONE PUNCHES A BUTTON 176 
 177 EXT. SPACE 177 
                   Reliant's shot crosses Enterprise's bow --

 178 INT. ENTERPRISE HOSPITAL 178 
                   The ship reverberates with the near miss. Chekov wakes
                   up, looks wildly about --

 BONES                              Take it easy --

 CHEKOV                              But I must --

 BONES                              Listen to me, Pavel; you haven't
                             the strength or the equilibrium --

 CHEKOV                              But --

                   As they talk, David, unnoticed, leaves the area. The
                   Enterprise is buffeted again --

 CAROL                              Dr. McCoy, I can't just sit here.
                             Tell me what I can do.

 BONES                                      (grim)
                             You can help get my surgery squared
                             away. I'm expecting customers.

                   She whitens in fear. ANOTHER SHOT reverberates.

 179 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 179 
 SAAVIK                              That was close --

 KIRK                                      (unfazed)
                             They just don't want us going in there.

 SPOCK                              One minute to nebula perimeter.

                   The bridge door slides open and David enters. He
                   stares in wonder. Saavik reacts to David.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Admiral, they're reducing speed.

 KIRK                              Uhura, patch me in --

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

 180 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 180 
 KHAN                              Why are we slowing?

 JOACHIM                              We daren't follow them into the
                             nebula, sir -- our shields will be
                             useless...

 KIRK'S VOICE                              This is Admiral Kirk.

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             We tried it once your way, Khan.
                             Are you game for a rematch?

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             Khan -- ! I'm laughing at the
                             "superior" intellect.

 KHAN                              Full impulse power!

 JOACHIM                              No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever
                             you want --

 KHAN                              Full power damn you!

                   And he reaches across and executes it himself.

 181 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 181 
                   They react to Reliant's speed-up. The nebula approach
                   is ON SCREEN.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             I'll say this for him: he's
                             consistent.

 182 EXT. SPACE - THE MUTARA NEBULA 182 
                   WE'RE VERY CLOSE NOW, and SEE CLEARLY the swirling,
                   slowly moving gases, magenta, purple, etc. There are
                   veils of luminescent materials and through all an
                   interlace of unpredictable electrical charges.

                   Like lightning, these intermittent great flashes
                   illumine whole sections of the nebula. OUR VIEW is
                   moving slowly forward...

 184 EXT. SPACE - THE NEBULA 184 
                   As Enterprise whooshes into the PICTURE headed into the
                   purplish gas -- and disappears into a cloud bank of
                   the stuff.

                   A moment then Reliant APPEARS, pursues Enterprise into
                   the gloom, also disappears.

 185 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 185 
                   ON SCREEN the picture is squirrelly purple, breaking
                   up. Blindness. Panic.

 KHAN                              Tactical!

 JOACHIM                                      (tries)
                             Inoperative.

 KHAN                              Raise the shields...

                   Electrical forces raging without are also reflected on
                   the circuits within. It's bumpy, on top of everything
                   else. Electronic WHINING.

 JOACHIM                              As I feared, sir. Not functional.
                             I'm reducing speed.

                   Khan does not argue.

 186 EXT. SPACE - PURPLE - SERIES OF SHOTS 186 
                   Cautiously Reliant emerges from a massive "cloudbank."
                   Electrical discharges abound. Barely moving, she feels
                   her way forward. Alone.

                   A treat: Enterprise is above and behind Reliant.

 188 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ON SCREEN 188 
                   Reliant's image is breaking up.

 SULU                              Phaser lock inoperative, sir.

 KIRK                              Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when
                             ready.

                   Sulu strains, then fires -- just as an electrical dis-
                   turbance bounces the bridge --

 189 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 189 
                   The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of
                   Reliant, amid CRACKLING discharges --

 190 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 190 
                   Rolls from the near-miss concussion --

 KHAN                              Aft-torpedoes -- fire -- !

 191 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 191 
                   Reliant is wide of the mark with a Photon torpedo.
                   A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE. When it clears,
                   Enterprise appears to be alone.

 192 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 192 
                   ON SCREEN, nothing but magenta amid picture breakup --

 KIRK                                      (sweating)
                             Hold your course. Look sharp...

 SAAVIK                              At what.

 193 EXT. NEBULA (INTERCUT WITH BRIDGE) 193 
                   Enterprise feeling its way...

 194 ON BRIDGE - POV ON SCREEN 194 
                   All peer into the lousy picture. Occasional electrical
                   flashes.

 195 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 195 
                   Still Enterprise moves forward... A LARGE FLASH... a
                   SUDDEN GLIMPSE: Reliant boring in on collision course!

 196 INT. ENTERPRSIE BRIDGE 196 
                   A sudden clearing ON SCREEN: Reliant!

 KIRK                              Evasive starboard!

                   Hard over, but not fast enough. Reliant fires a phaser.

 197 SERIES OF SHOTS 197 
                   Reliant's phaser shot hits the Enterprise torpedo room
                   in Dorsal Fin area of ship.

 198 INT. ENTERPRISE TORPEDO ROOM 198 
                   An EXPLOSION rocks the room and...

 199 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 199 
                   The Bridge rattles from the explosion below; Sulu is
                   thrown from his chair. Saavik leaps to her post --

 KIRK                              Phaser bank one, fire!

 200 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 200 
                   The Enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot
                   -- which rips along the side of Reliant's primary hull.

 200A INT. RELIANT BRIDGE (FORMERLY SCENE 205) 200A 
                   The bridge is damaged; Joachim and others are wounded...

 KHAN                              Joachim!

                   For the first time, his friend wounded, Khan hesitates,
                   holds him --

 JOACHIM                              Yours... is... the superior...

 KHAN                              I shall avenge you --

 200B NEW ANGLE 200B 
                   She veers to one side with the impact and disappears
                   into a deep purple mass.

 201 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 201 
                   Sulu is being helped by David --

 KIRK                              Damage, Scotty?

 202 INT. ENGINE ROOM 202 
                   Bones is there, helping some crewmen. The Reactor Room 
                   flashes a red warning light and glows with a blue 
                   light. The air is heavy with smoke but the doors,
                   damaged earlier, still hold.

 SCOTTY                              Admiral, I've got to take the mains
                             off the line. The energizer's shaken
                             loose and I can't get in there to
                             fix her -- radiation --

 203 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 203 
 KIRK                              All right, we'll do the job with
                             auxiliary power.

                   The bridge door opens and closes; Chekov, faint,
                   stands there.

 CHEKOV                              Could you use another hand, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

                   ANGLE FAVORING David as the others react to Chekov
                   taking his place. Quiet.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock?                             

                   Spock is bent over the scanner --

 SPOCK                              Sporadic energy readings port side,
                             aft. Could be an impulse turn.

 KIRK                              He won't break off now. If he
                             followed me this far he'll be back.
                             But from where...?

 SPOCK                              He's intelligent, but not experienced.
                             His pattern indicates two dimensional
                             thinking...

                   Kirk looks at him, smiles.

 KIRK                              Mr. Saavik, all stop.

 SAAVIK                              All stop, sir.

 KIRK                              Descend ten thousand meters. Stand
                             by photon torpedoes.

 204 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 204 
                   Reliant in purplish mass, banking slightly, completing
                   a long turn, then boring ahead.

 205 OMITTED 205 
 206 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 206 
                   As Reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear
                   almost tranquil place. Reliant, moving slowly, stops,
                   as if looking around.

 207 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 207 
                   The screens are empty.

 KHAN                              Where is he? Where in God's name
                             is he?

 208 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 208 
                   Reliant motionless in the f.g. amid occasional flashes.
                   Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale
                   rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,
                   slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy. When Enterprise
                   is above, behind and quite close:

 209 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 209 
                   Reliant ON SCREEN, intermittent but clear.

 CHEKOV                              Torpedoes ready, sir.

 KIRK                              Fire.

 210 SERIES OF SHOTS 210 
 A) EXT. ENTERPRISE 
                   fires torpedo; one which hits, destroying Reliant's
                   weapons pod on top.

 B) INT. RELIANT 
                   C)   EXPLOSIONS rock the interior of Reliant.

 D) EXT. ENTERPRISE 
                   fires two more times. The first causes general
                   damage. The second, close behind blasts Reliant's
                   port engine off into space, debris scattering.

 E) INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 
                   is devastated. Khan is blown from his chair and
                   WE'RE UNCERTAIN of his fate.

 211 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 211 
                   Reliant, now a scarred, battered hulk, her main hull
                   still intact, but dead in space.

 212 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 212 
                   No cheers, just deadly professionalism.

 KIRK                              Cease fire. Look sharp.

 SAAVIK                              Power levels quite low, sir.

 KIRK                                      (to intercom)
                             Mr. Scott, can you get the mains
                             back on line?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                                      (breaking up slightly) 
                             I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til
                             the radiation dissipates.

 KIRK                              Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant:
                             prepare to be boarded.

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

 213 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 213 
                   Amid the smoke and ruins, WE SEE no signs of life.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Commander, Reliant, this is
                             Enterprise. Surrender and prepare
                             to be boarded. Repeat...

                   In f.g., chillingly, Khan rises INTO SHOT by the main
                   console. He is horribly burned, and it is clear that
                   he is clinging to life by his will.

 KHAN                              No... Kirk. The game's not over.

                   As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself
                   into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless
                   at his side.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             To the last I will grapple with thee!

                   Painfully, with one good arm, he starts arming the
                   Genesis console.

 213A INT. RELIANT TRANSPORTER ROOM 213A 
                   There sits the Genesis torpedo: lights start blinking
                   in response. As we watch, the CHILD we met on Ceti Alpha
                   walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights.

 214 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 214 
 UHURA                              Enterprise to Reliant: you are
                             ordered to surrender your vessel.
                             Respond!
                                     (to Kirk)
                             Nothing, sir.

 KIRK                              We'll beam aboard. Alert
                             transporter room --

                             on Reliant. A pattern I've never
                             seen.

                   David peers closer over Spock's shoulder, reacts.

 DAVID                              It's the Genesis Wave!

 KIRK                              What?

 DAVID                              He's on a build up to detonation!

 KIRK                              How soon --

 DAVID                              We encoded four minutes --

 KIRK                              We'll beam aboard and stop it --

 DAVID                              You can't!

                   The briefest stunned moment. Kirk hits intercom:

 KIRK                              Scotty, I need warp speed in three
                             minutes or we're all dead!

 STATIC. 
 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Scotty!

                   Spock leaps from his place and disappears through the
                   bridge doors.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Saavik, get us out, best speed!

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 215 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 215 
                   Enterprise backs away from Reliant. Her speed is pain-
                   fully slow.

 216 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 216 
                   ON SCREEN, Enterprise, intermittent image, backs away.
                   Khan smiles triumphantly through his pain. An elec-
                   tronic power SOUND has been building.

 KHAN                              No... You can't get away... From
                             hell's heart I stab at thee...
                                     (amid the pain)
                             For hate's sake... I spit my last
                             breath at thee!

                   Khan topples forward, dead. The WHINE continues to
                   build chillingly.

 217 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 217 
                   Spock rushes in. Bones ministers to Scotty, b.g.

                   Spock sizes up the situation, starts for the radiation
                   room, Bones intercepts him.

 BONES                              Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
                             No human can tolerate the radiation
                             loose in there!

 SPOCK                              But, as you are so fond of observing,
                             Doctor, I'm not human.

 BONES                              You're not going in there -- !

 SPOCK                              I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss
                             this logically --

                   He gives Bones the Vulcan nerve pinch. Bones goes
                   down.

                   Spock presses the access button and enters the Reactor
                   Room, a separated area behind radiation-proof glass
                   and metal, RED FLASHING LIGHTS and an iridescent blue
                   glow within.

                   Bathed in blue light, arcing energy around him, Spock

 223 INT. ENTERPRISE REACTOR ROOM (INTERCUT AS 223 REQUIRED) 
                   Outside the glass, Scotty and Bones screaming:

 SCOTTY                              Captain, please!

 BONES                              Get out! Get out, man! Oh, dear

 224 WITHIN 224 
                   WE CAN SEE the silent urging of Bones and Scotty.
                   Spock is oblivious. Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves 
                   to the control panel. Between his hands and the con-
                   trols, power arcs insanely. Spock is in an inferno,
                   a radiation hell, fighting now with all his strength
                   to control it. Slowly, the damping rods move out.
                   Spock moves to a manual control, begins to turn it.

                   of to control the pain, continuing to work --

 227 WITHOUT 227 
                   Bones and Scotty react in helpless horror.

 228 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 228 
                   Enterprise still well within the nebula, Reliant a
                   figure still visible in b.g. She's crawling still.

 229 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 229 
                   Reliant, now symbol of death, ON SCREEN.

 KIRK                              Time!

 SAAVIK                              Three minutes, thirty seconds.

 KIRK                              Distance from Reliant...

 CHEKOV                              Four hundred kilometers.

                   Kirk looks at David, but David shakes his head: No
                   way. Then:

 CADET                              Sir! The mains are back on line -- !

 KIRK                              Bless you, Scotty. Go, Saavik!

                   She increases power and --

 230 EXT. SPACE NEBULA - SERIES OF SHOTS 230 
                   A)   With a burst of warp speed, Enterprise accelerates
                        out of the lazy pace and whooshes PUT OF SCENE,
                        leaving Reliant behind.

 B) POV RELIANT 
                        disappearing in the swirls of:

                        which clears the flame and --

 E) RELIANT 
                        The WHINE increases to fever pitch, then: she goes!

 F) EXT. MUTARA NEBULA - MASTER EFFECT 
                        As Reliant goes, so goes the nebula. The "Genesis
                        Effect" WE SAW in its earliest experiments, now 
                        seems familiar on a gigantic, cosmic scale.

                        The blinding flash at first, followed by the same
                        tumbling turbulence of the miniature test. It is
                        awesome.

 231 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 231 
                   The bridge doors open and Carol appears. Instinctively
                   she draws near her son.

                   Finally, Kirk turns, sees Carol --

 KIRK                              Reduce speed. My God, Carl. Look
                             at it.

                   ON SCREEN and INTERCUT -- GENESIS TUMBLES and starts
                   evolving. A moment in history.

 KIRK                                      (continuing, on
                                      intercom)
                             Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?

 BONES' VOICE                                      (after a beat)
                             Jim, you'd better get down here. Hurry.

                   The tone frightens Kirk.

 KIRK                              Saavik, take the con.

                   He moves through the doors quickly, leaving the rest
                   staring at the new world evolving.

 232 INT. STAIRWAY TO ENGINE ROOM 232 
                   It is endless. Kirk runs forever, feet pounding down,
                   down, down --

 233 EXT. SPACE AND ON SCREEN 233 
                   The clouds tumble and move, new things lie beyond --
 234 INT. STAIRS 234 
                   Kirk races --

 235 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 235 
                   Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones. Their
                   looks tell him. He sees the flashing light over the
                   Reactor Room. He dashes for the control panel. Bones
                   grabs him.

 SCOTTY                              No, sir! You'll flood the whole
                             compartment...!

 KIRK                              He'll die -- !

 BONES                                      (also holds him)
                             He's dead already, Jim.

                   Kirk's eyes bulge.

 KIRK                              Oh, God.

 236 ANGLE AT REACTOR ROOM GLASS DOOR 236 
                   With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door,
                   sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked
                   with radiation lines and scars.

                   Spock shakes his head. With a feeble hand he reaches
                   the intercom button: filtered communication.

 KIRK                              Spock!

 SPOCK                              The ship -- out of danger?

 KIRK                              Yes --

                   Spock is satisfied; he fights for breath --

 SPOCK                              Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's
                             logical: the good of the many
                             outweighs --

                   He almost keels over. Kirk has tears streaming down
                   his face.

 KIRK                              ... the good of the few...

 SPOCK                              Or the one.

                   He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's
                   hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side
                   of the glass --

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             I never took the Kobayashi Maru
                             test -- until now. What do you
                             think of my solution?

 KIRK                              Spock...!

 SPOCK                              I have been -- and always will be
                             -- your friend... Live. Long. And. 
                             Prosper.

                   Spock falls. Bones and Scotty react.

 KIRK                              No...!

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                                      (intercom)
                             Admiral, you've got to see this!
                             There's new life -- a whole new
                             world, a Genesis world -- !

                   But Kirk is past hearing or caring. He is huddled up
                   against the glass, destroyed. Bones looks on, helpless.

                   A spectacular look at Carol's planet being born!

 238 OMITTED 238 
 239 CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL 239 
                   the Ship's Company in full dress uniforms assembled for
                   ship's burial service. Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:

 KIRK                              In accordance with the traditions
                             of Starfleet and of Article 184
                             Starfleet Regulations, we are
                             assembled here today to pay final
                             respects to our honored dead.

                   Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED. David watching
                   Kirk attentively. So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik.
                   Bones stands next to Kirk. Scotty carries his bagpipes.
                   Saavik wears her hair down.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             And yet, in the midst of our sorrow
                             it should be noted that this death
                             takes place in the shadow of new
                             life, the sunrise of a new world,
                             a world that our beloved comrade
                             gave his own life to protect and
                             nourish. He did not feel that
                             sacrifice a vain or empty one --
                             and we will not debate his profound
                             wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
                             my friend, I can only say this, that
                             of all the souls I have encountered 
                             in my travels, his was the most --
                                     (he falters)
                             -- human.

                   He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is
                   streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant Saavik.

 240 OMITTED 240 
 241 ANGLE - THE GROUP 241 
                   Saavik steps forward.

 SAAVIK                              We commend the soul of our brother
                             departed. We love we commit his
                             body to the depths of space.

 SULU                              Honors -- hup!

                   All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE,
                   an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk
                   nods a signal.

 242 THE CAPSULE 242 
                   A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers
                   into the launching chamber, which locks behind it. At
                   a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired.
 NOISE. 
 243 EXT. SPACE 243 
                   Spock's remains seen on their way to the new world. 
                   The capsule grows too small to SEE. The bagpipes STOP.

 244 INT. TORPEDO ROOM 244 
 SULU                              Return -- hup!

                   The salute drop.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant.

                   She steps to him and they exchange salutes --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; very 
                                      quietly)
                             After you dismiss the company, you
                             will take the watch. Set course 
                             for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up 
                             survivors.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 KIRK                              I'll be in my quarters if needed,
                             but I would prefer...

 SAAVIK                              Understood, sir.

 KIRK                                      (aloud)
                             Dismiss the company.

                   They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards
                   the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting 
                   orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and
                   he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally
                   understands.

 245 INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS 245 
                   After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He
                   pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

                   He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
                   Then he sees the book.

                   Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
                   friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly
                   he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he
                   can't see the writing -- he rummages through his
                   pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --

                   One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on
                   Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers
                   his eyes.

                   A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.

 KIRK                              Yes... come.

                   The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The
                   last person Kirk expected to see.

 DAVID                              I don't mean to intrude.

 KIRK                              Uh, no...
                                     (rises)
                             I should be on the bridge.

 DAVID                              Are you running away from me?

                   David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --

 KIRK                              I suppose I was.
                                     (pause)
                             I poured a drink. Would you like
                             it?

 DAVID                              No. I -- I guess I'm not what you
                             expected.

 KIRK                                      (rueful)
                             I didn't expect anything.

 DAVID                              That makes two of us.
                                     (he studies his
                                      father)
                             Lieutenant Saavik was right: you
                             never have faced death --

 KIRK                                      (hoarse)
                             Not like this -- no. I haven't faced
                             death, I cheated death. I tricked
                             my way out of death and patted myself
                             on the back for my ingenuity. I
                             know nothing.

 DAVID                              You knew enough to tell Saavik that
                             how we face death is at least as
                             important as how we face life --

 KIRK                              It was just words.

 DAVID                              But good words. That's where ideas
                             begin. Maybe you should listen to
                             them.

 KIRK                              I'm trying, David.

 DAVID                              So am I. My friends were killed,
                             too.

 KIRK                              I am truly sorry.

                   Pause. They study each other.

 DAVID                              I was wrong about you. And I'm
                             sorry.

 KIRK                              Is that what you came here to say?

 DAVID                              Mainly.
                                     (he starts out,
                                      then turns -- )
                             And also that I'm proud -- very
                             proud -- to be your son.

                   A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for
                   David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold-
                   ing onto him as if to life itself.

 247 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 247 
                   The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David
                   with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at
                   what they see.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral on the bridge!

 KIRK                              As you were, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha.
                             All is well.

 KIRK                              Good, I believe you already know
                             my, uh, son --

                   Saavik comes close to blushing --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Yes, well, why don't you show him
                             around and...

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir --

                   She takes him off, deadpan amusement --

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             So you turn out to be the dumb
                             bastard.

                   They stare at her.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             That is a little joke.

                   Kirk has a smile. He joins Bones and Carol facing the
                   screen.

 BONES                              She's changed her hair again.
                                     (pause)
                             Will you look at that? Think
                             they'll name it for you, Doctor?

 CAROL                              Not if I can help it. We'll name
                             it for our friend.

 KIRK                                      (quietly)
                             It is a far far better thing I do
                             than I have ever done before... a
                             far better resting place I go to
                             than I have ever known...

 CAROL                                      (soft)
                             Is that a poem?

 KIRK                              Something Spock was trying to
                             tell me. On my birthday.

                   He shakes his head, remembering --

 BONES                              You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

 KIRK                                      (considers; smiles)
                             Young. I feel young, Doctor.

                   He turns to Saavik and David --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, new course: 'Second

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              Captain's log. Stardate 8130.3,
                             Starship Enterprise on training
                             mission to Gamma Hydra. Section 14,

 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 
                   As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations;
                   (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER
                   SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con-
                   sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The
                   Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young
                   and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan.
                   In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her
                   skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless
                   facial immobility of a Vulcan.

 SULU                              Leaving Section Fourteen for
                             Section Fifteen.

 SAAVIK                              Project parabolic course to
                             avoid entering Neutral Zone.

 SULU                              Aye, Captain.

 UHURA                                      (suddenly)
                             Captain... I'm getting something
                             on the distress channel. Minimal
                             signal... But something...

 SAAVIK                              Can you amplify?

 UHURA                              I'm trying...

 SULU                              Course change projected.

 UHURA                              It's an emergency distress call!

 SAAVIK                              On speakers!

                             the Kobayashi Maru -- nineteen
                             periods out of Altair Six. We
                             have struck a gravitic mine and

 SAAVIK                              Damn.

                             Mr. Sulu, plot an intercept course.

 SULU                              May I remind the Captain that if a
                             Starship enters the zone --

 SAAVIK                              I'm aware of my responsibilities,
                             Mister.

 SULU                                      (with a nod)
                             ... Now entering the Neutral

 SULU                              Estimating two minutes to intercept.

                   On screen: Enterprise approaches the stricken vessel.

 SAAVIK                              Stand by transporter room, ready
                             to beam survivors, aboard.

 UHURA                              Captain, I've lost their signal!

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Alert. Sensors indicate three
                             Klingon Cruisers, bearing 316,

 SAAVIK                              Visual!

                   On screen we see the approach  of the Klingon vessels,
                   they are dark and sinister.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Battle stations! Activate shields!

                   The ALARM SOUNDS.

 SULU                              Shields activated!

 SAAVIK                              Inform the Klingons we are on a
                             rescue mission...

 UHURA                              They're jamming all frequencies,
                             Captain --

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingons on attack course and closing.

                   Screen verifies this. Saavik makes an agonized choice.

 SAAVIK                              We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu,
                             get us out of here.

 SULU                              I'll try, Captain.

 COMPUTER VOICE                              Klingon cruisers approaching,
                             bearing 090, mark 20.

 SAAVIK                              Visual!

                   The image flops: more Klingons approach. They FIRE
                   photon torpedoes.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Evasive action!

                   Sulu does his best, but Enterprise is hit; Sulu is
                   hurled from his station, and Bones hurries to him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Engineering! damage report!

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (INTERCOM)                              Main energizer hit, Captain!

 SAAVIK                              Engage auxiliary power. Prepare
                             to return fire!

                   The bridge takes another hit -- a big one. In its wake
                   there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the communi-
                   cations panel. Uhura falls from her station. Bones
                   rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

 A CADET                              Shields collapsing, Captain!

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, we're losing auxiliary
                             power!

 SAAVIK                              Fire all phasers...!

 SPOCK                              No power to the weapons system,
                             sir.

                   Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame
                   on the bridge. Spock dies. Bones comes to him, but
                   even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final
                   hit and Bones falls. The room is smoke filled and a
                   shambles. Saavik looks about in shock.

 SCOTTY'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Captain, it's no use. We're
                             dead in space.

                   Saavik digests this for a painful moment. Then, touch-
                   ing a comm button:

 SAAVIK                              Activate escape pods. Send out the

                             Repeat -- all hands --

 KIRK'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              All right, open her up.

                   There is a loud CLANGING and  --

 4 FULL SHOT - ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 4 
                   The side walls of the "bridge" slide apart, revealing
                   a lighted room beyond. Through the opening strides
                   KIRK. He stops, surveys the shambles, and shakes his
                   head.

 SAAVIK                              Any suggestions, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons
                             do not take prisoners.
                                     (to Spock)
                             Captain.

 SPOCK                              Trainees to the briefing room.

                   Sulu awakens with a grin. Uhura straightens herself
                   demurely. The Trainees head toward the distant room,
                   Spock rises and leaves. Bones remains on the floor,
                   head propped in his hand, whimsically.

 KIRK                              Physician, heal thyself.

 BONES                              That's all you have to say?

 KIRK                              I'm not a drama critic.

                   Bones rolls his eyes and rises. Kirk sees Saavik who
                   has not moved.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going
                             to stay with the sinking ship?

 SAAVIK                              Permission to speak candidly, sir?

 KIRK                              Very well.

 SAAVIK                                      (fights emotion)
                             I don't believe this was a fair
                             test of my command capabilities.

 KIRK                              And why not?

 SAAVIK                              Because... there was no way to win.

 KIRK                              A no-win situation is a possibility
                             every commander may face. Has that
                             never occurred to you?

 SAAVIK                              ... No, sir. It has not.

 KIRK                              How we deal with death is at least
                             as important as how we deal with
                             life, wouldn't you say?

 SAAVIK                                      (falters)
                             As I indicated, Admiral, that
                             thought had not occurred to me.

 KIRK                              Then you have something new to think
                             about. Carry on.

                   She stays at attention.

 BONES                              Wouldn't it be easier to put
                             an experienced crew back on the
                             ship?

 KIRK                              They'll learn. Galloping about the
                             cosmos is a game for the young,
                             doctor.

                   He leaves. They look at each other.

 UHURA                                      (offended)
                             What is that supposed to mean?

                   HOLD ON Saavik.

 5 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY 5 
                   Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against
                   the wall.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             Aren't you dead?

                   Spock almost smiles.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             I assume you are loitering here
                             to learn what efficiency rating
                             I plan to give your cadets.

 SPOCK                              I am understandably curious.

                   They walk together.

 KIRK                              They destroyed the simulator room
                             and you with it.

 SPOCK                              The Kobayshi Maru scenario 
                             frequently wreaks havoc with
                             students and equipment.
                                     (dry)
                             As I recall you took the test
                             three times yourself. Your final
                             solution was, shall we say, unique?

 KIRK                                      (solemn)
                             It had the virtue of never having
                             been tried.                             

 SPOCK                              Yours was not a solution which
                             would have occurred to a Vulcan
                             mentality.

 KIRK                              So you said at the time. Speaking
                             of which, your protg's first
                             rare -- a trifle emotional --

 SPOCK                              She's half Romulan, Jim. The
                             admixture makes her more volatile
                             than -- me, for example.

 KIRK                              Than you. Yes, I see that. By
                             the way, thank you for this.

                   He lifts the book.

 SPOCK                              I know of your fondness for antiques.

 KIRK                                      (reads)
                             'It was the best of times, it was
                             the worst of times...' Message,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK                              None of which I am consciously
                             aware -- except, of course, happy
                             birthday -- surely the best of times.

                   Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps:

 KIRK                              Hrummm... and where are you off
                             to, now?

 SPOCK                              The Enterprise. I must check in
                             before your inspection. And you?

 KIRK                                      (shortly)
                             Home.

                   Spock studies him --

 SPOCK                              Something oppresses you.

                   They are old friends --

 KIRK                              Something.

                   He steps into a turbo elevator. The doors close as
                   Spock watches, wiping the scene.

 6 EXT. DEEP SPACE - NEAR CETI ALPHA V 6 
                   In f.g. is the U.S.S. RELIANT, an older, somewhat
                   battered starship of the ENTERPRISE class, with a
                   slightly different configuration. Reliant approaches
                   an inhospitable-looking yellow planet: CETI ALPHA V

 CHEKOV'S VOICE                              Starship log, Stardate 8130.4.
                             This report classified MOST SECRET.
                             Log Entry by Commander Pavel Chekov,

                             our search for a lifeless planet
                             which will serve as a suitable test
                             site for the Genesis Experiments.
                             This is the 16th planet we have
                             visited, so far, no success.
 7 INT. BRIDGE OF RELIANT 7 
                   Well-aged and distinctive. The usual compliment of
                   officers and crew. CAPTAIN CLARK TERRELL, about 45,
                   soft spoken and in good shape, but somewhat laconic.

                   Behind Terrell, surveying the data screen is COMMANDER
                   CHEKOV, aged some, but still boyish.

 TERRELL                              Standard orbit, Mr. Beach.

 BEACH                              Standard orbit, sir.

 TERRELL                              Any change in surface scan?

 BEACH                              Negative. Limited atmosphere,
                             dominated by craylon gas, sand and
                             high velocity winds. Incapable
                             of supporting life forms.

                   Forward screen: Ceti Alpha.

 CHEKOV                              Does it have to be completely
                             lifeless?

                   Terrell rises and crosses to Chekov.

 TERRELL                              Don't tell me you've got something.

 CHEKOV                                      (points)
                             We've picked up a minor energy flux
                             reading on one dyno scanner.

 TERRELL                              Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the
                             scanner's out of adjustment --

 CHEKOV                              I suppose it could be a particle
                             of preanimate matter caught in the
                             matrix...

 TERRELL                              All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to
                             Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something
                             we can transplant.

 CHEKOV                              You know what she'll say...

 8 EXT. DEEP SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION 8 
                   A functional cluster of modules serve as a scientific
                   complex, a futuristic White Sands, orbiting a small
                   barren plantoid in b.g.: Regula.

 CAROL MARCUS'S VOICE (FILTERED)                              Something you can transplant? I
                             don't know --

 9 INT. SPACE STATION - CAROL'S LAB 9 
                   Big but deserted except for Carol, in contact with
                   Reliant. Surrounded by equipment clearly meant for
                   many workers, CAROL MARCUS is in her early forties,
                   attractive and intelligent. Static mars the trans-
                   missions.

                   On the monitor: Terrell and Chekov, looking hopeful.

 TERRELL                              It might only be a particle of
                             preanimate matter...

 CAROL                              Then again it might not. You
                             boys have to be clear on this:
                             there can't be so much as a
                             microbe or the show's off.
                                     (she thinks)
                             Why don't you have a look? If it
                             IS something that can be moved...

 TERRELL                                      (eager)
                             You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

                   Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.

 10 INT. CORRIDOR, SPACE STATION REGULA I 10 
                   Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with
                   DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
                   He is good looking and humorous.

 DAVID                              How can you let them pull that
                             stuff on you? They're just lazy.

 CAROL                              And bored. I know. But maybe it
                             IS something they can...

 DAVID                              Come on, Mother, that's just the
                             military mentality. Never put off
                             tomorrow what you can put off today.
                             If there's one atom of life...

 CAROL                              I know, I know...

                   Silence.

 DAVID                              Well, don't have kittens.
                             Genesis is going to work. They'll
                             remember  you in a wreath with
                             Newton, Einstein, Surak...

 CAROL                                      (mock outrage)
                             Thanks a lot. No respect from my
                             offspring --

 DAVID                              Par for the course... you teaming
                             up with me for bridge after dinner?

 CAROL                              Maybe...

 DAVID                              Every time we have dealings with
                             Starfleet, I get nervous.
                                     (shrugs)
                             We're dealing with something
                             that COULD be perverted into
                             a dreadful weapon. Remember that
                             overgrown boy scout you used to
                             hang out with? That's exactly
                             the --

                   They walk past the CAMERA, their VOICES FADING.

 CAROL                              Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many
                             things, but he was never a Boy
                             Scout...

                   HOLD ON the empty corridor.

 11 INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT 11 
                   Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. His flat befits
                   an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except
                   a collection of antiques.

 WE HEAR A SOFT BONG. 
                   Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.

 KIRK                              Come.

                   The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two
                   packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Bless me, doctor; and what beams
                             you into this neck of the woods?

 BONES                              'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'
                             Happy Birthday...

                   With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue
                   liquid.

 KIRK                              Romulan Ale! Bones, you know
                             this stuff is illegal --

 BONES                                      (broad)
                             I only use it for medicinal
                             purposes. Don't be a pring...

 KIRK                                      (reading the label
                                       with difficulty)
                             Twenty-two, eighty-three...

 BONES                              Takes the stuff a while to
                             ferment. Gimme.

                   He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Now open the other one.

                   Kirk starts to obey.

 KIRK                              I'm almost afraid to. What did
                             you bring me, contraband Klingon --

 BONES                              More antiques for your collection
                             -- Cheers!

                   They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold
                   "Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is
                   an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.)

 KIRK                              Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.

 BONES                              Four hundred years old. You don't
                             find many with the lens still
                             intact.

 KIRK                              Uh -- what are they?

 BONES                              For your eyes. For most patients
                             of your age, I generally administer
                             Retlax Five to restore flexibility
                             of the lens.

 KIRK                              But I'm allergic to Retlax.

 BONES                              Exactly. Happy birthday.

                   He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Slide them down your nose. Now look
                             at me over the top. And you read
                             printed matter through the bottom.

 KIRK                                      (reacts)
                             Amazing! I don't know what to say --

 BONES                              Say thank you.

 KIRK                              Thank you.

                   An awkward silence.

 BONES                              Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the
                             matter? Other people have birthdays.
                             Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

 KIRK                              Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

 BONES                              What DO you want? Damn it, why
                             isn't there a girl here? You know
                             this has nothing to do with age.
                             This is about you flying a goddamn
                             computer console when you wanna be
                             out hopping Galaxies.

 KIRK                              Spare me your notions of poetry,
                             please. We all have our assigned
                             duties and...

 BONES                              Bull. You're hiding -- hiding
                             behind the rules and regulations --

 KIRK                              And who am I hiding from?

 BONES                              From yourself, Admiral.

                   Pause. Kirk pours another drink.

 KIRK                              Don't mince words, Bones; tell
                             me what you really think.

 BONES                                      (mild take)
                             I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, 
                             Jim. Get back your command. Get it
                             back before you really do grow old.
                             Before you turn into part of this
                             collection.

                   They look at each other.

 12 EXT. RELIANT - DEEP SPACE 12 
                   orbiting Ceti Alpha V.

                   VOICES OVER indicate the transporter room is ready.

 13 OMITTED 13 
 14 EXT. SURFACE CETI ALPHA V 14 
                   A YELLOW PLANET, in constant SWIRLING HURRICANE WINDS
                   OF SAND. Terrell and Chekov materialize. Their VOICES,
                   filtered, are hard to make out.

                   With the TRICORDER to guide them, they set out...

 TERRELL                              Are you sure these are the
                             coordinates?

 CHEKOV                              Captain, this is the garden spot
                             of Ceti Alpha VI --

 TERRELL                              I can hardly see --

 15 SEVERAL ANGLES 15 
                   The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind --

 16 TERRELL 16 
                   is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise --

 CHEKOV                              There's nothing, let's go --

 17 ANGLE 17 
                   Terrell waves him frantically forward. As Chekov
                   moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and
                   look down.

 18 ANGLE - THEIR POV 18 
                   A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half buried in
                   sand. They look at each other in consternation. Chekov
                   is worried; something about all this is familiar.

                   They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
                   wreckage of some sort of space craft.

                   They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
                   buried next to their feet.

 TERRELL                              They look like cargo carriers...

                   As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks
                   back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition
                   scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He
                   screams.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What is it?

                   He comes clumsily over --

 CHEKOV                              A face! I saw -- it was like a
                             child --

                   He points. The porthole is empty.

 TERRELL                              You're crazy -- !

 CHEKOV                              I saw it -- !

 TERRELL                              There's an air-lock.

                   He points and they go into the airlock.

 19 INT. CARGO HOLD 19 
                   Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV.
                   Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury-
                   rigged -- but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.

 TERRELL                              There's breathable atmosphere in here.

                   He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             What the hell is this? Did they
                             crash? Where's the rest of the
                             ship?

                   They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be-
                   speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a
                   laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; A LARGE SAND TANK
                   filled with disgusting CETI EELS.

                   ABRUPTLY A SOUND -- They start: CHILD'S GURGLE.

 CHEKOV                                      (terrified)
                             I told you! I told you I saw a --

 TERRELL                              Ssssh!

                   They start looking. They enter a new chamber --

 20 KHAN'S QUARTERS 20 
                   On its side in the sand: the walls are now the floor,
                   etc. All in crookedness -- like its owner. On the
                   floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.

                   Tentatively they come over to it, looking around --

 21 ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV 21 
                   Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;
                   CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING
                   LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE -- and a seat belt dangling with
                   the name on it -- Botany Bay.

                   Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud --

 CHEKOV                              Botany Bay -- oh no!

 TERRELL                                      (examines the child)
                             What's the matter -- ?

                   Chekov runs, tries to get his helmet on, tries to drag
                   Terrell --

 CHEKOV                              Captain, we've got to get out of
                             here -- now! Damn! Hurry!

                   Terrell catches his urgency --

 TERRELL                              But the child --

 CHEKOV                              Never mind! Hurry!

 22 EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY 22 
                   Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.

 23 ANGLE - THEIR POV 23 
                   A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.

 24 INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE 24 
                   Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti
                   Alpha V on the forward screen.

 BEACH                              Try again.

 KYLE                              Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell
                             ... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will
                             you please respond, Captain...
                             Captain Terrell, respond please.

                   Nothing.

 BEACH                                      (thinks)
                             Let's give them a little more
                             time.

 25 INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V 25 
                   Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.

                   They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM.

                   Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A
                   moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri-
                   fied. The mask is peeled back.

 CHEKOV                                      (aloud despite himself)
                             Khan!

                   KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and
                   examines Chekov and Terrell.

 KHAN                                      (finally)
                             I don't know you. But you. I never
                             forget a face. Mister Chekov,
                             isn't it?
                                     (wonderingly)
                             I never thought to see your face
                             again.

 TERRELL                              Chekov, who is this man?

 CHEKOV                              A criminal, Captain -- a product of
                             the late 20th Century genetic
                             engineering --

 TERRELL                              What do you want with us? I demand --

 KHAN                                      (mild)
                             You are in a position to demand
                             nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,
                             am in a position to grant nothing.
                             What you see is all that remains of
                             the ship's company and the crew of the
                             Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen
                             years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

 TERRELL                              Listen to me -- you men and women --

 KHAN                              Save your strength, Captain, these
                             people have sworn to live and die at
                             my command two hundred years before
                             you were born. Do you mean he...
                                      (i.e. Chekov)
                             ... never told you the tale?
                             To amuse you, Captain? Never told
                             you how the Enterprise picked up the
                             Botany Bay, lost in space from the
                             year 1996, myself and the ship's
                             company in cryogenic freeze?

 TERRELL                              I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

 KHAN                              Admiral? He didn't tell you how
                             Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into
                             exile on this barren sand heap with
                             only the contents of these cargo bays
                             to sustain us?

 CHEKOV                              You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was
                             life, a fair chance to --

 KHAN                              This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI
                             exploded six months after we were
                             left here. The shock shifted the
                             orbit of this planet and everything
                             was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never
                             bothered to check on our progress.
                             It was only the fact of my genetically
                             engineered intellect that enabled us
                             to survive! On earth, two hundred
                             years ago, I was a prince, with power
                             over millions -- now, like Prometheus
                             I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
                             digest my own entrails.

 CHEKOV                              Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid
                             his hospitality by trying to steal his
                             ship and murder him.

 KHAN                                      (moves closer)
                             And I'll wager he never told you
                             about his shipmate, the beautiful
                             and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,
                             who gave up everything to join me
                             in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how
                             Admiral Kirk requited her devotion --
                             She's dead as earth!

                   The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his
                   eyes are filled with tears.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             A plague upon you all.

                   He recovers his poise and returns to them --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             You didn't expect to find me.
                             You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.
                             Why are you here?

                   They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH
 ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR -- 
 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Why?

                   Terrell gasps, stays silent --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             No matter.

                   He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             You will soon tell me willingly
                             enough.

                   He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,
                   pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
                             only remaining indigenous life form;
                             what do you think? They've killed
                             twenty of my people, including my
                             beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
                             and not instantly, to be sure. Their
                             young enter through the ears and wrap
                             themselves around the cerebral cortex.
                             This has the effect of rendering the
                             victim extremely susceptible to
                             suggestion. Later, as they grow,
                             follows madness, paralysis -- and
                             death. These are pets, of course --
                             not quite domesticated.

                   As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;
                   he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
                   martinis --

 CHEKOV                              Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk
                             was only doing his duty! You --

 26 CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN 26 KHAN                              There is some pain at first, I am
                             told, and then the effects are quite
                             benign -- until the end. That was
                             what I learned from watching my wife.

                   At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled
                   shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across
                   the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-
                   stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
                   There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
                   dazed calm.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             That's better! Now: tell me why
                             you are here -- and tell me where I
                             may find James Kirk.

 27 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 27 
 KYLE                              Captain Terrell. Captain Terrell...
                             This is Reliant; please respond.

                   No answer -- Beach makes up his mind --

 BEACH                              Mr. Kyle, muster a landing party
                             with full arms. Alert the
                             transporter room. We're beaming
                             down.

                   He heads for the door but is stopped by:

 TERRELL'S VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             Reliant, this is Terrell. Respond
                             please.

 BEACH                              This is Reliant. Clark, are you
                             all right?

                   Fractional pause.

 TERRELL'S VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             Everything's fine, commander. I'll
                             explain when I see you. Oh, by the 
                             way, we're bringing several guests
                             aboard. Prepare to beam up on my
                             next signal. Terrell out.

                   Beach and Kyle look at each other.

 KYLE                              Guests?

 BEACH                              Maybe we ARE transplanting something.

 28 EXT. ORBITING SPACE DOCK AREA - TERRA (FEATURE STOCK) 28 
                   A SPACE SHUTTLE moving toward us.

 29 INT. SPACE SHUTTLE 29 
                   A new composite. Bones, Sulu, Uhura and Kirk -- who
                   sits, reading. Through the windows we can see the
                   approach to the starship ENTERPRISE. Kirk looks up,
                   nods. Sulu activates a comm button.

 SULU                              Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
                             party on final approach.

 ENTERPRISE VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             Enterprise welcomes you. Prepare 
                             for docking.

                   Kirk looks up from his book as Sulu sits next to him.

 KIRK                              I really must thank you.

 SULU                                      (embarrassed)
                             I am delighted; any chance to go
                             aboard Enterprise, however briefly,
                             is always an excuse for nostalgia.

 KIRK                              I cut your new orders personally. By
                             the end of the month, you'll have your
                             first command: USS EXCELSIOR.

 SULU                              Thank you, sir. I've looked
                             forward to this for a long time.

 KIRK                              You've earned it. But I'm still
                             grateful to have you at the helm
                             for three weeks. I don't believe
                             these kids can steer.

                   Sulu laughs.

 30 EXT. SPOCE DOCK - TERRA (FEATURE STOCK) 30 
                   The shuttle approaches the mammoth airstrip. As we
                   near the ship, a few WORK CREWS IN SPACE flit about
                   her hull, working.

 31 EXT. ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK) 31 
                   The shuttle makes its way to the Docking Lock of the
                   mother ship and settles in place.

 32 INT. ENTERPRISE DOCKING BAY 32 
                   A reception group awaits, led by Captain Spock. Saavik
                   stands at his side, in company of the Trainee crew.
                   Also present: CHIEF ENGINEER MR. SCOTT and members of
                   his staff in their distinctive uniforms.

 INTERCOM VOICE                              Docking procedure complete.

 SPOCK                              Prepare for Admiral's inspection.

                   The group comes to attention.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Open the Air Lock.

                   The doors open. Kirk and his staff are piped aboard
                   by an electronic version of the boatswain's tradi-
                   tional whistle. Kirk salutes the Federation symbol
                   and steps forward to exchange salutes with Spock.

 KIRK                              Permission to come aboard, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe
                             you know my trainee crew. Certainly
                             they have come to know you.

 KIRK                                      (dryly to Saavik)
                             Yes, we've been through death and
                             life together.

                   Saavik stiffens slightly -- humor is not her forte.

 KIRK                                      (continuing to Scotty)
                             Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're
                             well?

 SCOTTY                              I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy
                             pulled me through.

 KIRK                              Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?

                   Uncomfortable, Scotty exchanges a glance with Bones --

 BONES                              Shore leave, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Ah.

                   He stops before a BRIGHT-FACED FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD, stand-
                   ing so stiff he looks like he'll break -- in an
                   engineer's uniform.

 KIRK                                     (continuing)
                             And who is this?

 PRESTON                                      (breathless)
                             Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
                             engineers mate, SIR.

                   A big salute. Kirk is amused, returns the salute.

 KIRK                              Your first training voyage, Mr.
                             Preston?

 PRESTON                              Yes, SIR.

 KIRK                              I see. Well, shall we start with
                             the engine room?

                   He moves, followed by his staff.

 SCOTTY                                      (eyeing his protg)
                             I believe you'll find all in order --

 SPOCK                              We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Very good, Mr. Spock.

                   Kirk and party leave. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON SPOCK AND
 SAAVIK. 
 SAAVIK                              He's not what I expected, Sir.

 SPOCK                              What did you expect, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                                      (uncertain)
                             He's very human.

 SPOCK                              We can't all be perfect, Saavik.
                             You must control your prejudices
                             and remember that as a Vulcan as
                             well as a Romulan you are forever
                             a stranger in an alien land.
                             Around you are humans, and as a
                             member of the Starfleet you are
                             unlikely ever to escape their
                             presence or their influence.
                             You must learn to tolerance in addition
                             to all else I have taught you.
                             Tolerance is logical.

                   Saavik is humbled.

 SAAVIK                              As always, my mentor. Company dismiss.

 33 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM - LOOKING DOWN 33 
                   The inspection party dwarfed by the size. Silence as
                   Kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc.
                   Scotty, his team and Preston, stand at attention.

 34 ANGLE - FLOOR OF ENGINE ROOM 34 
                   FEATURING power room separated by glass from the rest
                   of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train-
                   ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the
                   responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston.

 PRESTON                                       (blurting)
                             I believe you'll find everything
                             shipshape, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (sternly puts
                                      him on)
                             Oh do you? Have you any idea,
                             Midshipman Preston, how many times
                             I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on
                             the Comm, telling me his troubles?
                             Have you any idea the ribbing I've
                             had to endure in the officers' mess
                             to the effect that the Enterprise
                             is a flying death trap?

 PRESTON                                      (scandalized)
                             Oh, no, sir! This is the finest
                             engine room in the whole Star --

                   The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's
                   face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused.

 PRESTON                                      (continuing)
                             If the Admiral can't see the facts
                             for himself, then, with all due
                             respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion
                             bat. SIR.

                   Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused.

 KIRK                              Midshipman, you're a tiger.

 SCOTTY                              My sister's youngest, Admiral.
                             Crazy to get to space.

 KIRK                              Every young boy's fancy. I seem
                             to remember it myself.
                                     (brisk)
                             Very well. Mr. Scott, are your
                             engines capable of handling a minor
                             training cruise?

 SCOTTY                              Give the word, Admiral.

 KIRK                              Mr. Scott, the word is given.

 SCOTTY                              Aye, sir.

                   He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last
                   salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.

 BONES                                      (dry)
                             What about the rest of the
                             inspection, Admiral?

 KIRK                              The inspection will continue once
                             we're underway, Doctor.

                   They step into the Turbo Lifts.

 35 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 35 
                   The real one, no doubt! CAMERA REVEALS the maze detail:

                   a hum of activity, Uhura and Sulu in familiar chairs,
                   Spock is in the Captain's chair, Saavik in the First
                   Officer's position. Kirk and Bones stand towards the
                   rear.

 SULU                              Admiral on the bridge!

 SPOCK                              Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all
                             moorings.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

                   Saavik punches data into her console.

                   The dock slowly folds away from the ship.

 37 INT. BRIDGE, ENTERPRISE 37 
                   Saavik watches instruments, punches data in response.

 SAAVIK                              All moorings are clear, Captain.

 SPOCK                              Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

                   Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik:

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, how many times have you
                             piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

 SAAVIK                              Never, sir.

                   Kirk tries to conceal his reaction. Spock enjoys it.

 SPOCK                              Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

                   Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at
                   the console -- Spock looks at Kirk.

 SPOCK                              There's a first time for everything,
                             Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (casual)
                             To be sure, Captain.

                   They all stifle their responses. Kirk is like a father
                   watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.

 SAAVIK                              Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

 SULU                              Aft thrusters, sir.

 SAAVIK                              Ahead one quarter impulse power.

                   Kirk starts to say something, but doesn't. Bones looks
                   at him.

 BONES                                      (sotto voice)
                             Would you like a tranquilizer?

                   Kirk shakes his head, takes a breath --

                   Kirk quietly lets his breath out.

 SULU                              We are clear and free to navigate.

 SAAVIK                              Course heading, Captain?

                   Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk.

 KIRK                              Captain's discretion.

                   Spock digests this with a slight smile.

 SPOCK                              Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose.

 45 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 45 
                   Khan occupies the Captain's chair. We PULL BACK: the
                   crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol-
                   lowers in their odd-looking clothes.

                   At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the
                   largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in
                   the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console.
                   Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation,
                   symptoms of their mind-controlled state.

 JOACHIM                              Steady on course. All systems normal.

 KHAN                              It's not much different from
                             Enterprise.

                             When I was a guest aboard her some
                             years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed
                             me to memorize her technical manuals.
                             And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:
                             You say you have no details of
                             Project 'Genesis' ?

 CHEKOV                              Beyond what I told you, sir, it is
                             classified information.

 KHAN                              Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have
                             access to such information?

 CHEKOV                              I would think so, sir. He's on the
                             Fleet General Staff.

 KHAN                              Then to whom do you report directly
                             regarding Genesis?

 CHEKOV                              To Doctor Marcus, the civilian
                             director of the experiments on Space
                             Laboratory Regula I.

 KHAN                                      (thinks)
                             I see. Helmsman?

 HELMSMAN                              Aye, sir.

 JOACHIM                              May I speak? We're all with you,
                             sir, but consider: we are free,
                             we have a ship and the means to
                             go where we will. We have
                             escaped permanent exile on Ceti
                             Alpha V. You have proved your
                             superior intellect and defeated
                             the plans of Admiral Kirk.
                             You do not need to defeat him
                             again.

 KHAN                              He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll
                             chase him round the moons of Nibia
                             and round the Antares maelstrom and
                             round perdition's flames before I give
                             him up.
                                     (as no one speaks)

                   Huge and busy. Among the scientists going about their
                   tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense;
                   MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and
                   earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer
                   console.

 DAVID                              Does that about do it?

 CAROL                              I don't think there's another piece
                             of information we could squeeze
                             into the memory banks. Next
                             time, we'll design a bigger
                             one.

 DAVID                              Who --

                   Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps.

 JEDDA                              Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel
                             ... It's Reliant.

                   Carol moves forward as the others close in.

 CAROL                              On the screen, please, Jedda.

                   Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles
                   on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.

 CHEKOV                              ... come in, please. This is Reliant
                             calling Regula I. Repeat. This is
                             USS Reliant --

 CAROL                              Commander, we are receiving. This
                             is Regula I. Go ahead.

 CHEKOV                              Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route
                             to you and should be there in three
                             days.

 CAROL                              En route? Why? We weren't expecting
                             you for another three months. Has
                             something happened?
                                     (pause)
                             Has something happened? Do you read 
                             us?

 CHEKOV                                      (fractional pause)
                             All went well. Nothing has happened.
                             Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

                   Pleased reaction from the scientists.

 CAROL                              I still don't under --

 CHEKOV                              We have received new orders. Upon our
                             arrival at Regula I, all materials of
                             Project Genesis will be transferred to
                             this ship for immediate testing at
                             Ceti Alpha VI.

                   Consternation in the lab. David is livid -- the words
                   "Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet!
                                     (back to console)
                             Commander Chekov, this is completely
                             irregular. Who gave the order you
                             are quoting? Who gave the order?

 CHEKOV                                      (still smiling)
                             The order comes from Starfleet
                             command, Dr. Marcus, direct from
                             the General Staff.

 CAROL                              But Genesis is a civilian project,
                             under my control --

 CHEKOV                              I have my orders.

 DAVID                              Pin him down, mother! Who gave the
                             orders!?

                   Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off
                   the monitor.

 CHEKOV                              The orders come from Admiral James
                             T. Kirk.

                   Sensation in the lab.

 DAVID                              I knew it! I knew it! All along
                             the military has wanted to get their
                             hands on this --

                   He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand
                   away and communicates herself.

 CAROL                              This is completely improper,
                             Commander Chekov. I have no
                             intention of allowing Reliant or
                             any other unauthorized personnel
                             access to our work or materials.

 CHEKOV                                      (pauses; listens)
                             I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.
                             Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
                             Please prepare to deliver Genesis to
                             us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

                   The image fades.

 KHAN                              Well done, Commander.

 CHEKOV                              You realize, sir, that they will
                             attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and
                             confirm the order.

                   Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.

                   Everyone is talking at once.

 CAROL                              Will you please be quiet! We must
                             have order here.
                                     (as they subside)
                             This has to be some sort of mistake.

 DAVID                              Mistake? We're all alone here.
                             They waited until everyone was on
                             shift-leave to do this. Reliant is
                             supposed to be at our disposal, not
                             vice-versa.

 MADISON                              It seems clear that Starfleet never
                             intended that --

 CAROL                              I know, but --

 DAVID                              I've tried to warn you. Scientists
                             are always pawns of the military --

 CAROL                                      (angry)
                             Starfleet has kept the peace for
                             a hundred years, I cannot and
                             will not subscribe to your 
                             interpretation of this event.

                   Silence.

 JEDDA                                      (Deltan cool)
                             You may be right, Doctor, but what
                             about Reliant? She's on her way.

                   Carol reacts: this is certainly true.

 CAROL                              Get your gear together where it's
                             handy.

 MARCH                              Where are we going? 

 CAROL                              That's for us to know and Reliant
                             to find out. We have only three
                             days. Let's not waste time.

                   They split off in different directions as ordered.

                   In no particular hurry.

 52 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 52 
                   Kirk waits for the Turbo Lift, which opens at last. As
                   he gets in --

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                              Hold please -- !

                   Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in. She is surprised to
                   see him.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Kirk nods, the doors close. There is an uneasy forced
                   intimacy between them.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, are you wearing your
                             hair differently?

 SAAVIK                              It is still regulation, Admiral.

                   She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             May I speak, sir?

 KIRK                              Lieutenant, self-expression does not
                             seem to be one of your problems.

 SAAVIK                              I wish to thank you for the high 
                             efficiency rating.

 KIRK                              You earned it.

 SAAVIK                              I did not think so.

 KIRK                              You're bothered by your performance
                             on the Kobayashi Maru.

 SAAVIK                              I failed to resolve the situation.

 KIRK                              There is no correct resolution.
                             It is a test of character.

 SAAVIK                              May I ask how you dealt with the
                             test?

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             You may ask, Lieutenant.

                   She stares.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             That was a little joke.

 SAAVIK                              Humor... that is a difficult concept
                             ... it is not logical...

 KIRK                              We learn by doing, Lieutenant.

                   She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the
                   elevator starts.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             You want my advice?

                   She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the
                   attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle
                   it.

 SAAVIK                              Yes.

 KIRK                              Take the test again.

                   The lift stops and the doors open.

 BONES                              Who's been holding up the damn
                             elevator?

                   He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely.

 SAAVIK                              Thank you, sir.

                   Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the
                   ceiling.

 BONES                              Has she changed her hairstyle?

                   Kirk says nothing.

 BONES                                      (finally)
                             Wonderful stuff, that Romulan
                             ale --

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Admiral Kirk --

 KIRK                              Kirk here.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              I have an urgent CommPic from Space
                             Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr.
                             Carol Marcus.

 KIRK                              In my quarters, Uhura.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Yes, sir.

                   Awkward silence.

 BONES                              It never rains but when it pours --

 KIRK                              As a physician you of all people
                             should appreciate the danger of
                             re-opening old wounds.

                   The elevator stops. Kirk leaves. The doors close.

 BONES                                      (annoyed with
                                      himself)
                             Sorry.

 53 INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS 53 
                   Featuring VIEW SCREEN: A scramble of interference and
                   noise. A piece of Carol's VOICE breaks through now
                   and again as we PULL BACK revealing a frustrated Kirk.

 KIRK                              Uhura. Can't you augment?

 UHURA                              I'm trying, sir. Stand by...

                   Carol's face appears. The image will never be stable
                   for long; sometimes the sound will be covered.

 CAROL                              Jim... read me? Can you read me?

 KIRK                              Message breaking up, Carol. What's
                             wrong? What's wrong?

 CAROL                              ... Can't read you... repeat...

 KIRK                              Repeat... what's wrong? What's
                             wrong?

 CAROL                              ... taking Genesis away from us...

 KIRK                              Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking
                             Genesis?

 CAROL                              ... see you but can't hear. Did
                             you... order...?

 KIRK                              What order? Who's taking Genesis?

 CAROL                              ... Please help us, Jim... won't
                             let them have... without proper...

 KIRK                              Carol!

 CAROL                              Jim please --

                   But the picture is irrevocably scrambled now. Kirk
                   pounds the Comm in frustration.

 KIRK                              Uhura! What's happening? Damn
                             it...

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Transmission jammed at the source,
                             sir.

 KIRK                              Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
                             I want to talk with Starfleet

                   The activity is normal. The Turbo-Lift opens and Kirk
                   strides in. Bones and Saavik react to the following:

 KIRK                              Stop engines.

 SULU                              Stop engines.

                   They look wonderingly. Kirk takes a breath --

 KIRK                              An emergency situation has arisen.
                             By order of Starfleet Command, as
                             of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming
                             command of this vessel. Duty officer
                             so note in the ship's log. Plot a

                             Mr. Scott?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Aye, sir.

 KIRK                              We'll be going to warp speed --

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Aye, sir --

 KIRK                              Engage warp engines --

 SAAVIK                                      (comes out of being
                                      stunned)
                             Prepare for warp speed.

 SULU                              Ready, sir.

 KIRK                              Mr. Sulu, go to Warp 5.

                   Sulu does, and with a great thrust of energy --

 57 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (FEATURE STOCK) 57 
                   The ship accelerates, and then, with an eye-filled
                   burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing.

 57A INT. SPOCK'S QUARTERS 57A 
                   Spock is at meditation as Kirk enters quietly. Spock
                   looks up.

 KIRK                              We've got a problem.

                   Spock raises an eyebrow --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Something may be wrong at Regula
                             I. We've been ordered to investigate.

 SPOCK                              Regula I is a scientific research
                             laboratory, if memory serves...

 KIRK                              I told Starfleet all we had was a
                             boatload of children but we're the
                             only ship in the quadrant. Spock:
                             those cadets of yours -- how good
                             are they? How will they respond
                             under real pressure?

 SPOCK                              Like all living beings, Admiral
                             each according to his gifts. The
                             ship is yours.

 KIRK                              That won't be necessary: just take
                             me to Regula I.

 SPOCK                              Excuse my presumption, but I do not
                             agree. As a teacher on a training
                             mission, I am content to command a
                             Starship. If we are to go on actual
                             duty, it is clear that the senior
                             officer aboard must assume command.

 KIRK                              But it may be nothing; garbled
                             communications. Why don't you...

 SPOCK                              You proceed from a false assumption.
                             I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

                   Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.

 KIRK                              You are going to remind me that
                             logic alone dictates your actions.

 SPOCK                              I was going to remind you of nothing,
                             least of all that which you know well.
                                     (pause)
                             Your mistake, if I may be so bold,
                             was promotion. Commanding a Starship
                             is your first best destiny. Anything
                             else is a waste of material.

 KIRK                              I would not presume to debate you.

 SPOCK                              That is wise. In any case, were I
                             to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
                             that the needs of the many outweigh
                             the needs of the few.

 KIRK                              Or the one.

                   Spock inclines his head.

 SPOCK                              You are my superior officer. You
                             are also my friend. I have been
                             and always shall be yours.

                   Kirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally:

 KIRK                              Will you accompany me to the bridge?

 SPOCK                              I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first
                             so that he may, in his own words,
                             explain the situation to his cadets.

                   Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice.

                             Space Lab Regula I. Come in, please.

                             are unable to respond.

 KIRK                              How far?

                             minutes, present speed.

 KIRK                              Give up Genesis, she said. What in
                             God's name does that mean? Give it
                             up to whom?

 SPOCK                              It might help my analysis if I knew
                             what Genesis was.

                   Kirk looks at him, nods; rising now.

 KIRK                              Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in

                             Genesis is a procedure whereby

                             to become clear.
                             This concludes this demonstration
                             tape. Thank you for your attention.

                             the next phase of our work.

                   The tape becomes snowy and blinks off.

                   Kirk looks at Bones and Spock -- they are stunned.

 SPOCK                              It literally is Genesis...

 KIRK                              The power of creation --

                             experiments?

 KIRK                              The tape was made a year ago. I
                             can only assume they've reached
                             Phase Two by now --

 BONES                              But dear Lord, are we intelligent
                             enough to -- Suppose, this
                             thing were used where life already
                             exists?

 SPOCK                              It would destroy such life in favor
                             of its new matrix --

 BONES                              It's new -- have you any idea what
                             you're saying?

 SPOCK                              I was not attempting to evaluate
                             its moral implications, Doctor.
                             As a matter of cosmic history, it
                             has always been easier to destroy
                             than to create --

                             at the same time! According to myth,
                             the earth was created in six days.
                             Watch out: here comes Genesis;
                             we'll do it for you in six minutes --

                             are the right hands, my cold-blooded
                             friend? Are you in favor of these

                             the acquisition of knowledge
                             because you distrust the moral

 KIRK                              Raise shields! Energize phasers,
                             stand by to --

                   But the ENTIRE BRIDGE is ROCKED by a shock impact, some
                   of the crew sent flying.

 76 EXT.SPACE 76 
                   Reliant firing phasers at Enterprise. A hit in the rear
                   of the engine room area, debris flying into the void.

 77 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 77 
                   An explosion rips through the facility, sending yellow-
                   ish green GAS hurtling down the long facility towards us.
                   Crewmen are hurled through the air, screaming.

 SIRENS SHRIEKING!

                   terrified, scramble to get out amid the deadly yellow-
                   ish green smoke, the cries.

 80 ANGLE - SCOTTY 80 
                   trying to rally them --

 SCOTTY                              Respirators! Get back! Use your
                             respirators!

                   And he puts his own respirator on, as do some of the
                   veterans. Preston dons his respirator -- and stays.

 81 HIGH ANGLE - ENGINE ROOM 81 
                   The angle we saw during inspection. The trainees, in
                   panic amid the gas crawl over each other trying to get
                   out. They scramble over each other's shoulders in the
                   efforts to escape, screaming and shouting.

 82 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 82 
                   The bridge is slowly righting. Crew members getting
                   back to their stations. On speaker, we hear the CRIES
                   AND SHOUTS of the Engine Room.

 KIRK                              Mr. Sulu... The shields!

 SULU                              Trying, sir!

 INTERCOM VOICE                              Medical Alert: Engine Room.

                   Bones dashes out.

 SULU                              I can't get power, sir!

 KIRK                              Scotty!

                   Scotty's voice is faint, drowned by the screams and
                   cries from a dozen intercom stations.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Uhura, turn off those damn 
                             channels!!

                   Uhura does. There is a dead silence. Then:

 UHURA                              Mr. Scott on discrete.

 KIRK                              Scotty, let's have it.

                   mike which filters his voice.

 SCOTTY                              Just hanging on, sir. Main energizers

                   the display.

 SPOCK                              They knew just where to hit us.

 KIRK                              WHO? Who knew just where to hit
                             us? And why?

 SPOCK                                      (shakes head)
                             One thing is certain; we cannot
                             escape on auxiliary power.

 KIRK                              Hang on!

                   The bridge is shaken badly, screens go dark, fires spark
                   and erupt. ALARMS and SOUND full. Crew personnel try
                   to put out electrical fires, help the fallen --

                   The firefighting continues.

 KIRK                              Scotty -- what's left?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Just the batteries, sir. I can have
                             auxiliary power in a few minutes --

 KIRK                              We don't have minutes. Can you
                             give me phaser power?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              A few shots, sir.

 SPOCK                              Not enough against their shields.

 KIRK                              Who the hell are they?

 UHURA                              Admiral... Commander Reliant is
                             signaling.

                             He wishes to discuss terms of our
                             surrender.

                   There is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered
                   bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's.

 KIRK                              On screen.

 UHURA                                      (hesitating)
                             Admiral --

 KIRK                              Do it, while we have time.

                   All eyes go to the SCREEN. After momentary visual
                   confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; dumbfounded)
                             Khan!

 SAAVIK                              Who?

 KHAN                              You still remember, Admiral. I
                             cannot help but be touched. Of
                             course, I remember you.

 KIRK                              What is the meaning of this attack?
                             Where is the crew of the Reliant?

 KHAN                              Surely I have made my meaning plain.
                             I mean to avenge myself upon you,
                             Admiral. I've deprived your ship of
                             power and when I swing round I mean
                             to deprive you of your life --

                             -- But I wanted you to know first
                             who it was who had beaten you: I,
                             Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you
                             attempted to cage forever.

 KIRK                              Khan, listen to me -- if its me you
                             want, I'll have myself beamed aboard.
                             All I ask is that you spare my crew.

 KHAN                              That is a most intriguing offer.
                             Typical, I must say of your sterling
                             character. Let me think.

                             to yourself, you turn over to me all
                             data and material regarding the
                             project called Genesis.

                   Reactions from Spock and Kirk.

 KIRK                              Genesis, what's that?

 KHAN                              Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is
                             on the phaser control --

 KIRK                              Give me some time to recall the data
                             on our computers --

 KHAN                              I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

                   Kirk turns from the screen --

 SPOCK                              Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

 KIRK                              At least we know he hasn't got it.
                             Just keep nodding as though I'm
                             giving orders. Saavik, punch up the
                             data charts of Reliant's command
                             console -- hurry...

 KIRK                              It's all we've got.

 SAAVIK                              On screen...

                             give us time -- the bridge is
                             smashed, computers inoperative...

 KHAN                              Time is a luxury you do not have,

                             Wait for my signal, Spock -- too
                             soon and he'll have time to figure
                             it out and raise them again.

                   Spock nods; Kirk turns to the screen --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Khan, how do I know you'll keep
                             your word?

 KHAN                                      (on screen)
                             I've given you no word to keep,
                             Admiral. In my judgment, you simply
                             have no alternative.

 KIRK                              I take your point. Stand by to
                             receive our transmission.

                   He turns from the screen again, softly:

 JOACHIM                              Sir, we must!
                                     (desperate urging)
                             We must repair the damage. Enterprise
                             will wait; she's not going anywhere.

                   Khan calms as the other holds him; he breathes deeper.

 101 EXT. SPACE 101 
                   Reliant turns away.

 102 ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 102 
                   They watch on screen as Reliant hauls off.

 SULU                                      (breathless)
                             Sir, you did it.

 KIRK                                      (enraged)
                             I did nothing -- except get caught
                             with my britches down. I must be
                             senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep
                             right on quoting regulations.
                             Meantime, let's find out what the
                             hell is going on and see how bad
                             we've been --

                   The turbo doors whoosh open as Kirk reaches them.
                   Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face;
                   he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them
                   are covered in blood. He sways into Kirk's arms as
                   the others rush forward.

 103 EXT. SPACE 103 
                   The Enterprise, motionless, scars of battle showing.

 104 INT. ENGINE ROOM 104 
                   The CREW, wearing respirators amid the motionless ball
                   of gas, work frantically at a dozen jobs, trying to put
                   things aright, splicing wires, etc. Some TRAINEES who
                   panicked are back.

 105 FEATURE THE CREW CHIEF 105 
                   making a final adjustment.

 CREW CHIEF                              Hit your blowers!

                   A TURBO WHINES and a great wind of suction pulls the
                   gas towards appropriate vents. The Crew Chief watches,
                   then yanks off his respirator; wipes his brow.

 106 INT. SICK BAY 106 
                   MANY CASUALTIES IN EVIDENCE. Kirk enters and LEADS
                   CAMERA THROUGH them; he has a word or two for men he
                   doesn't know by name. Kirk leads us to the operating
                   theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands
                   by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees
                   Scotty and Kirk.

 PRESTON                                      (faint)
                             Is the word given?

 KIRK                                      (soft)
                             The word is given: warp speed.

 PRESTON                                      (almost smiles)
                             Aye...

                   He dies. Pause. Scotty looks across the body at Kirk.

 SCOTTY WHY? 
 KIRK                                      (looks at Preston)
                             He wants to kill me for passing
                             sentence on him 14 years ago -- and
                             he doesn't care who stands between
                             him and his vengeance.

 BONES                              Scotty, I'm sorry...

 SCOTTY                              He stayed at his post. When the
                             trainees ran, he stayed.

 KIRK                              If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Admiral, this is Spock.

                   Kirk hits a wall intercom --

 KIRK                              Yes, Spock.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Engine room reports auxiliary power
                             restored. We can proceed at impulse
                             power.

 KIRK                                      (thinks)
                             Best speed to Regula I. Kirk
                             out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any
                             chance of getting the mains back on
                             the line?

 SCOTTY                              I dinna think so, sir, but you'll
                             have my best --

                   With an effort, he gets to his feet --

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor...

                   Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR
                   the sound of impulse power taking effect.

 KIRK                              Are you all right?

                   Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston.

 BONES                              Doctors lose patients sometimes.
                             Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd
                             he know about Genesis?

 KIRK                              At the moment that question takes
                             a back seat to preventing him from
                             laying his hands on it. You said it
                             yourself; we're talking about a bang
                             that would re-arrange the universe...

 BONES                              There may still be time... you gave
                             as good as you got.

 KIRK                                      (looks him in the eye)
                             I got beat. We're only alive because
                             I knew something about these ships
                             that he didn't.

                   He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at
                   Preston.

 107 EXT. SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION 107 
                   Regula, the dead planet beyond.

 108 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE 108 
                   Approaching. As she moves slowly PAST CAMERA, WE PAN
                   WITH her TO SEE that she is approaching the space lab.

 109 INT. BRIDGE - ENTERPRISE 109 
                   Battle damage, some repaired, some not. The bridge is
                   filled with tension, all hands at station.

 SULU (V.O.)                              Approaching Regula and Space Lab
                             Regula I.

 KIRK                              Try again.

 UHURA                              Space Station Regular I, this is
                             Starship Enterprise. Come in, please...

 110 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB - ON SCREEN 110 
                   As before, Uhura's image, imploring a response.

 UHURA                              I say again. Space Station Regular.
                             This is Starship Enterprise. Please
                             respond. Please respond.

                   During this, CAMERA HAS PANNED CLOSE AMONG the techni-
                   cal clutter. Then suddenly. SOUND -- eerie, frightening.
                   Our ears cannot place it... and before we can, it is gone
                   a warning.

 111 BACK TO BRIDGE 111 
 UHURA                              ... No response, sir.

 KIRK                              Sensors, Captain?

 SPOCK                              Scanners and sensors still inoperative.
                             There's no way to tell what's  inside
                             the station.

 KIRK                              And no way of knowing if Reliant
                             is still in the area...

 SPOCK                              Affirmative, Admiral.

 KIRK                                      (with irony)
                             ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat.
                             What do you make of the plantoid
                             beyond?

 SPOCK                              Regula is class "D'. It consists of
                             various remarkable ores. Essentially,
                             a great rock in space.

 KIRK                              Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.

 SPOCK                              A distinct possibility.

 KIRK                              Engine room... Scotty, do we have
                             enough power for the transporters?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                              Just barely, sir.

 KIRK                                      (the decision)
                             I'm going down to the station.

                   He starts out. Bones stops him.

 BONES                              Khan could be down there!

 KIRK                              He's BEEN there and hasn't found
                             what he wants. Can you spare
                             someone? There may be people
                             hurt.

 BONES                              I can spare me...

 SAAVIK                              Begging the Admiral's pardon:
                             General Order 15: 'No  flag officer
                             shall beam into a hazardous area
                             without armed escort.'

 KIRK                              There is no such regulation.

                   Saavik's gaze falters --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             All right, join the party.
                             Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

 SPOCK                              Aye sir --

 KIRK                              Establish a parking orbit around
                             the station and send me a complete
                             damage report when you've talked
                             with Mr. Scott.

 SPOCK                              Be careful, Jim...

                   Kirk, Bones and Saavik head for the turbo doors.

 112 EXT. SPACE - SPACE STATION REGULAR I 112 
                   CLOSER ANGLE now. The silence is ominous.

 113 INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB 113 
                   empty, except for the hums and crackles of abandoned
                   equipment. With a FAMILIAR SOUND, BONES, KIRK and
                   SAAVIK MATERIALIZE. All have phasers, communicators
                   and tricorders.

                   For a moment they look around, seeing emptiness. Like
                   being in a haunted house.

 KIRK                              Hello...! Anybody here?

                   A WEIRD ECHO reverberates his cries.

 SAAVIK                                      (raises tricorder)
                             Indeterminate life signs.

 KIRK                              Phasers on stun. Move out.

                   They separate. Each begins to search.

 114 ANGLE WITH SAAVIK 114 
                   She moves to the electronic and data area, examines the
                   consoles, the equipment, then settles for the data bank.
                   She starts keying sequences with the computer.

 115 INT. SPACE STATION - BONES 115 
                   He shows signs of fear as he walks through the deserted
                   place, like a scuba diver exploring a cave. We want
                   him to go back.

                   A NOISE. Bones reacts with brave apprehension.

                   Rounding a corner, he starts: A RAT scuttles right in
                   front of him.

                   Bones sighs with relief and moves forward. We think
                   he's safe.

                   SUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE: an upside
                   down human ARM.

 116 SAME LOCALE - LATER 116 
                   Kirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five BODIES
                   from where they were hanged, upside down.

                   Having recovered his composure, Bones examines the
                   corpses. We RECOGNIZE Madison, March, among others.

                   One is clearly the COOK.

 KIRK                                      (stunned)
                             They even killed the galley chief.

 BONES                              This one looks like a Steward.
                             They're not warm, but rigor hasn't
                             set in. This didn't happen all that
                             long ago, Jim.

                   Kirk looks around, despairingly --

 KIRK                              Carol...

 117 INT. SPACE LAB DATA BANK 117 
                   WITH SAAVIK working with console. Something puzzles
                   her. She frowns, but a NEW SOUND distracts her. She
                   looks up and moves off.

 118 FULL SHOT - IN THE LAB 118 
                   A moan is heard. All three now converge on the area.
                   As they near it, Saavik's tricorder hums furiously. Be
                   this a room, a locker of some other place, this time
                   they -- "open the door." The limp bodies of Chekov and
                   Terrell fall out.

 UHURA'S VOICE                                      (on screen)
                             Admiral Kirk, Enterprise. Come in,
                             please. Come in please.

                   She will continue sporadically.

 KIRK                              My God!

                   Chekov emits a live, reassuring moan.

 BONES                              That's Clark Terrell, Jim, I've
                             served with him.

                   Bones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov.

 BONES                                      (continuing)
                             Brain disturbance. Appears to be
                             drug induced.

                   He reaches into his kit. He shoots Chekov moves off
                   to Terrell. Uhura, voice continues in the b.g.

 KIRK                              Saavik, for God's sake, tell her
                             we're all right.

 119 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FAVORING UHURA 119 
 UHURA                              I say again. This is Enterprise.

                   Saavik's face appears on her screen.

 SAAVIK                                      (on screen, hurried)
                             Commander Uhura, this is Lt. Saavik.
                             We're all right. Please stand by.
                             Out.

 UHURA                                      (baffled)
                             Aye, aye.

 120 INT. SPACE STATION - TIGHT GROUP 120 
                   Chekov opens his eyes, and stares into Kirk's.

 CHEKOV                              Oh, God, Admiral...!

                   He weeps like a child, and Kirk holds him. Meanwhile,
                   Terrell opens his eyes and stares at Bones.

 BONES                              It's Dr. McCoy, Captain. Do you
                             remember me?

 TERRELL                              McCoy? Yes. Oh, yes.

 121 ANGLE FAVORING CHEKOV AND KIRK 121 
                   Chekov breaks the embrace in high relief and anxiety.

 CHEKOV                              Oh, sir. It was Khan! We found him
                             on Ceti Alpha V.

 KIRK                              Easy, Pavel... Tell me what you
                             can...

 CHEKOV                              No life signs -- but he was there.
                             Captured us. He -- he put creatures
                             in our bodies. To control our minds.

                   Bones takes over Chekov --

 BONES                              It's all right, you're safe...

 CHEKOV                              ... Made us say -- lies... Do...
                             things... But we beat him... The
                             Captain and me. -- He thought he
                             controlled us, but he didn't ...
                             The Captain was strong.

                   Chekov breaks into tears. Kirk looks at Terrell, who is
                   more composed.

 KIRK                              Captain. Where is Dr. Marcus?
                             Where are the Genesis materials?

 TERRELL                              He couldn't find them. Some of
                             the scientists were still here,
                             but everything else, even the data
                             banks -- were empty.

 SAAVIK                              That's true, Admiral. All the
                             memory cells have been emptied.

 KIRK                                      (ponders)
                             Erased...

 TERRELL                              He tortured those people. None of
                             them would tell him anything. He
                             went wild, strung them up and slit
                             their throats. He wanted to tear
                             the place apart, but he was late:
                             he had to get back to Reliant in
                             time to blow you to bits.

 KIRK                              He came damn close...

 CHEKOV                              He left us.
                                     (with irony)
                             We were no longer of use.
 SAAVIK                              Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?

 TERRELL                              Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's
                             completely mad, Admiral. He blames
                             you for the death of his wife...

 KIRK                              I know what he blames me for.
                                     (thinks)
                             The escape pods are all in place.
                                     (looks around)
                             Where's the transporter room?

 122 INT. SPACE STATION TRANSPORTER ROOM 122 
                   Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter
                   consoles. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the transporter pods,
                   and the others, b.g.

 KIRK                              Did he make it down here?

                   Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit
                   stronger.

 CHEKOV                              It was not my impression. He spent
                             most of his time trying to wring the
                             information out of the people.

                   Saavik approaches Kirk:

 SAAVIK                              Anything?

                   Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

 KIRK                              Somebody left the unit on. If
                             everyone else was dead, it implies
                             that no one remained to turn it off.
                             Those people back there bought escape
                             time for Genesis with their lives.

                   Saavik studies the console.

 SAAVIK                              It doesn't make sense. These
                             coordinates are well within
                             Regula -- a plantoid we know to be
                             lifeless and airless.

 KIRK                                      (wheels turn)
                             If Stage Two was completed, it was
                             underground -- she said it was going
                             to be underground.

 SAAVIK                              Stage Two of what?

                   Kirk gets it.

 KIRK                                      (on communicator)
                             Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,
                             Spock?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Admiral, if we go by the book, like
                             Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem
                             like days.

 KIRK                                      (beat)
                             I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

                   Fractional pause.

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              The situation is grave, Admiral. We
                             won't have main power for six days
                             at least. Auxiliary power has
                             temporarily failed, but maybe we can
                             restore that in two days. By the
                             book, Admiral.

                   Kirk frowns.

 KIRK                              Meaning you can't even beam us back?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Not at present.

                   Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides --

 KIRK                              Captain Spock, if you do not hear
                             from us within one hour your orders
                             are to restore what power you can,
                             take the Enterprise to the nearest
                             Star Base and alert Starfleet
                             command when you are out of jamming
                             range.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

 KIRK                              Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
                             there won't be anybody behind. Kirk
                             out.
                                     (to Terrell and Chekov)
                             You gentleman can remain here, or...

 TERRELL                              If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd
                             like to share the risk.

 KIRK                                      (hesitates)
                             Very well. Let's go.

 BONES                              Go? Where are we going?

 KIRK                                      (points to console)
                             Where they went. Saavik.

                   Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console,
                   rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

 BONES                              But what if they went -- nowhere?

 KIRK                              Then this will be your big chance
                             to get away from it all.

 SAAVIK                              Ready.

                   She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly
                   they VANISH.

 123 EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA 123 
                   CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
                   with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.
                   The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

 124 INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA 124 
                   The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort-
                   able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then
                   APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral --

                   She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA
                   reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials
                   and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version
                   of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE
 GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.) 
 BONES                              Genesis, I presume.

                   They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very
                   fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to
                   the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.

                   At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their
                   phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has
                   them covered and helpless.

 125 ANGLE FAVORING DAVID 125 
 DAVID                              You're the sonavabitch who
                             committed mass murder up there.

                   He raises the knife --

 KIRK                              I'm Admiral Kirk...

 DAVID                              We were still there, you dumb
                             bastard! We could hear the screams
                             all the way to the transporter room --

                   Again he raises the knife --

 KIRK                              Where's Dr. Marcus --

 DAVID                              I'm Doctor Marcus!

                   Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave --

 CAROL                              David --

 DAVID                              Mother, go back!

                   Carol sees Kirk --

 CAROL                              Jim --

 DAVID                              Go back. I'm going to kill him.

 CAROL                                      (takes a breath)
                             You do that and you'll have murdered
                             your father.

                   All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are
                   turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look
                   at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the
                   phaser from Jedda.

 126 NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134) 126 
 TERRELL                                      (cool)
                             I'll hold onto this.

                   But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each
                   other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches
                   up, trying to smile and touches his hair --

 CAROL                              You've got a little grey --

                   She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look-
                   ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there,
                   stunned, looking back.

 KIRK                              Carol. Is that true?

                   She nods --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Why didn't you tell me?

 DAVID                              She's making it up! My father was
                             Professor --

 CAROL                              David, you're just making this
                             harder --

 TERRELL                              I'm afraid it's even harder than you
                             think, Doctor.

                   He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them.

 TERRELL                                      (continuing)
                             Please don't move --

 KIRK                              Chekov -- !

 CHEKOV                              I'm sorry, Admiral.

                   Terrell speaks into his wrist recorder.

 TERRELL                              Your excellency, have you been
                             listening?

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (filtered)
                             I have indeed, Captain. You have
                             done well...

 DAVID                              I knew it -- !

                   David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik
                   instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
                   Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --
                   a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS
                   and David reacts with horror and guilt.

                   Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell
                   himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in
                   semi-panic.

 TERRELL                              Don't move -- any of you!

                   Joachim over his shoulder. Others in evidence. Khan
                   speaks into his console.

 KHAN                              Captain... We're waiting. What's
                             the delay?

 137 INT. ROCKY CAVERN (INTERCUT AS DESIRED) 137 
 TERRELL                              All is well, sir. You have the
                             coordinates to beam up Genesis...

 KHAN                              First things first, Captain. Kill
                             Admiral Kirk.

                   Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
                   David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
                   Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting
                   mental signals.

 TERRELL                              Excellency... it is difficult.
                             I try to obey, but --

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Kill him.

                   As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the
                   wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-
                   wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and
                   tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims
                   his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser
                   and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.
                   We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,
                   shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

 KHAN'S VOICE                                      (still emanates from
                                      wrist recorder)
                             Kill him, Terrell. Now.

                   Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

 138 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 138 
                   He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
                   head.

                   Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from
                   his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm. Chekov,
                   almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

 KHAN'S VOICE                              Terrell? Chekov -- !

 BONES                              Jim -- for God's sake!

                   They rush to his side, as do Carol and David.

 139 ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV 139 
                   From the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge.

 140 VERY CLOSE - CHEKOV'S EAR 140 
                   The Ceti eel crawls out. It has grown quite large.

 141 SCENE 141 
                   Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel
                   clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,
                   then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

 KIRK                              Khan, you bloodsucker, they're
                             finished! You'll have to do your
                             own dirty work now. Do you hear me?
                             Do you?

 142 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 142 
                   Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He
                   clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

 KHAN                              Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive --
                             my old friend...

 INTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH 
 143 ROCKY CAVERN - FAVORING KIRK 143 
 KIRK                              Still, 'old friend.' You've
                             managed to kill just about everyone
                             else, but like a poor marksman, you
                             keep missing the target.

 KHAN                                      (ironic)
                             Perhaps I no longer need to try.

                   He punches several buttons.

                   In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the
                   Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

                   As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up
                   the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but
                   Saavik holds him fast --

 DAVID                              Let go -- he can't -- !

 SAAVIK                              Only half of you would get there.

                   The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them
                   alone.

 KIRK                                      (desperate)
                             Khan, you have Genesis, but you
                             don't have me! You were going to
                             kill me, Khan, it was your sole
                             purpose. You'll have to come down
                             here to do it! You'll have to
                             come down!

 KHAN'S VOICE                              I've done far worse than kill you,
                             Admiral. I've hurt you. And I
                             wish to go on hurting you. I
                             shall leave you, as you left me --
                             where no one will ever find you:
                             poetic justice; marooned for
                             eternity in the center of a dead
                             planet -- buried alive.

 KIRK                              Khan -- !

 KHAN                              Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't
                             count on Enterprise. She can't
                             move. My next act will be to blow
                             her out of the heavens.

                   Khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction.
                   Joachim enters and Khan looks at him.

 KHAN                              Well?

 JOACHIM                              Warp drive still inoperative. All

                   Khan sighs, contentedly.

 KHAN                              Excellent. We have all the time
                             in the world.

 146 INT. ROCKY CAVERN 146 
                   As before, Saavik is on the communicator.

 SAAVIK                              This is Lt. Saavik, calling Enterprise...

                   She keeps trying. Chekov stirs --

 BONES                              He's alive!

                   Bones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up.

 KIRK                              Pavel?

                   Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand --

 SAAVIK                              No use, Admiral, they're still
                             jamming all channels.

 BONES                                      (looks across Chekov)
                             It wouldn't make any difference.
                             If Enterprise obeyed orders she's
                             long since gone. And if she couldn't
                             obey, she's finished.

 DAVID                              So are we, it looks like.

 CAROL                              I don't understand.
                             Who's responsible for all this?
                             Who is Khan?

 KIRK                              It's a long story.

 DAVID                              We appear to have plenty of time.

 BONES                                      (dry)
                             You and your father can catch up on
                             things.

 DAVID                                      (bitter)
                             My father. I hope you realize
                             another man has just been killed
                             because of...

 BONES                              Because of you, son. You shouldn't
                             have tried to rush someone holding
                             a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't
                             one man dead, it's two, in case
                             you've lost count.

                   David has been effectively spiked. Long silence.

 KIRK                              Do you have anything to eat? I
                             don't know about anyone else, but
                             I'm starved.

 BONES                              How can you think of food at a time
                             like this?

 KIRK                              Our first order of business is survival.

 CAROL                              There's food in the Genesis cave,
                             enough to last a lifetime -- should
                             that be necessary.

 BONES                              We thought this was Genesis.

                   Carol laughs -- there's an edge of hysteria to it.

 CAROL                              This? It took the Starfleet corps
                             of engineers ten months in space
                             suits to tunnel out all this. What
                             we did in there -- we did in a day.
                             David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
                             and the Lieutenant our idea of food.

 DAVID                              But we can't just sit here -- !

 KIRK                                      (unruffled)
                             Oh, yes we can. Is there really
                             something to eat?

                   David looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting
                   on his spectacles.

 CAROL                              David. Please.

 DAVID                                      (to Kirk)
                             This is just to give us something
                             to do, isn't it?
                                     (he shrugs)
                             Come on.

                   Saavik and Bones make to follow. Saavik turns to Kirk --

 SAAVIK                              Admiral?

 KIRK                              As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond

                   Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap,
                   looking at Kirk.

 CAROL                              David was right, wasn't he? It's
                             just to keep them busy.

 KIRK                              Why? Why didn't you tell me?

 CAROL                              How can you ask me that? Were we
                             together? Where we going to be?
                             You had your world and I had mine.
                             I wanted him in mine, not chasing
                             through the universe with his father.

                   Kirk turns away, overcome. She watches him.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He's a lot like you in many ways.
                             Nothing I could do about it. He's
                             smarter, of course; that goes without
                             saying. Most of Genesis is really
                             his.

                   Her joke doesn't take effect. He doesn't turn.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             This is it, isn't it? We're never
                             going to get out of here.

                   Kirk says nothing.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

                   Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he
                   changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks.

 KIRK                              There's a man I haven't seen in
                             fifteen years who thinks he's killed
                             me. You show me a son who'd almost be
                             happy to help him. My son. My life
                             that could have been and wasn't. What
                             am I feeling? I'm feeling old --
                             worn out.

                   Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down
                   on a sweater, then stands.

 CAROL                              Let me show you something that will
                             make you feel young -- young as when
                             the world was new.

                   She offers her hand. Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles,
                   faint assurance.

 CAROL                                      (continuing)
                             He'll be all right. Come.

                   After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and
                   she leads him to the tunnel.

 150B INT. TUNNEL 150B

 150E FULL SHOT - THE GENESIS CAVE (MATTE AND FX) (FORMERLY 150E SCENE 130) 
                   A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle
                   of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point
                   of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water-
                   falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a
                   round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.
                   There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower
                   level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling
                   to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

                   as Carol comes up beside him.

 KIRK                              You did this -- in a day?!

 CAROL                              The matrix formed in a day. The
                             life forms grew later -- at a
                             wildly accelerated rate. Can I
                             cook or can't I?

 JOACHIM                              Impulse power restored.

                   Khan smiles.

 KHAN                              More than a match for poor
                             Enterprise.

                   He punches at his console.

 159A ANGLE FAVORING DAVID AND SAAVIK 159A 
                   who watches him.

 DAVID                              What are you looking at?

 SAAVIK                              The Admiral's son.

 DAVID                              Don't you believe it.

 SAAVIK                              Oh, I believe it.

                   She almost smiles. David returns her stare and it
                   throws her.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             What are you looking at?
 DAVID                                      (confused)
                             I don't know.

 159B INT. GENESIS CAVE - WIDER ANGLE 159B 
                   Saavik rises, paces. Kirk puts down his food.

 KIRK                              Now that's what I call a meal.

 BONES                              It's like the Garden of Eden...

 CAROL                              Only here, every apple comes from
                             the Tree of Knowledge.

                   Kirk watches Saavik.

 KIRK                              What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                              The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

 DAVID                              The what?

 BONES                              The no-win scenario -- and with
                             what philosophy a commander faces
                             defeat.

 KIRK                              Are you asking me if we are playing
                             out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

 SAAVIK                              On the test, sir, will you tell me
                             what you did? I'd really like to
                             know.

                   Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles --

 BONES                              Lieutenant, you are looking at the
                             only Starfleet cadet who ever beat
                             the no-win scenario --

 KIRK                              And almost got tossed out of the
                             Academy...

                   He looks at his watch again, using his glasses --

 SAAVIK                              How?

 KIRK                              I reprogrammed the simulation so it
                             was possible to rescue the ship.

 SAAVIK WHAT? 
 KIRK                              I changed the conditions of the
                             test. I received a commendation for
                             original thinking.
                                     (pause)
                             I don't like to lose.

 SAAVIK                              Then -- you never faced that
                             situation -- faced death...

 BONES                              Until now.

 KIRK                              We each face death every day we're
                             alive, Saavik.

                   He picks up the communicator.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours.
                             Are you about ready?

 SPOCK'S VOICE                              Right on schedule, Admiral. Just
                             give us your coordinates and we'll
                             beam you aboard.

                   The others are on their feet, stunned with amazement --

 KIRK                              Right. I don't like to lose.

                   He clicks off.

                   David gapes at his father.

                   WE CAN SEE NOW where Enterprise is: she has slipped
                   behind the plantoid, clockwise, even as Reliant was

                   them.

 SAAVIK                              But the damage report -- we were
                             immobilized...

 KIRK                              Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all
                             people go by the book. Hello,
                             Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...

                   They are moving through the room as they talk --

 SPOCK                              Certainly...

 SAAVIK                                      (overlapping)
                             By the book...

                             are being monitored during battle...'

 SAAVIK                              '... no uncoded messages on an open
                             channel...'

                   Saavik steps in front of Spock.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             You lied.

 SPOCK                              I exaggerated.

 KIRK                              Hours instead of days, Saavik; now
                             we have minutes instead of hours --

 BONES                                      (behind)
                             I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.

 SPOCK                              They're inoperative below C-deck.

 164 INT. ANOTHER ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 164 
                   They race down corridors as they speak -- 

 KIRK                              What IS working around here?

 SPOCK                              Not much, Admiral. We have partial
                             main power...

 KIRK                              That's it?

 SPOCK                              Best we could do in two hours.

                   We see the Enterprise emerging from the dark side of
                   Gamma Regula, where Reliant is now a moving blip.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Uh oh.

 SPOCK                              She can out-run us and out-gun us.

 KIRK                                      (studies his console)
                             Scotty, can we make it inside?

 SCOTTY                              The energizer's bypassed like a
                             Christmas tree -- so don't give me
                             too many bumps.

 KIRK                              No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

 SAAVIK                              Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all
                             that static discharge and gas clouds 
                             our tactical display. Visuals won't 
                             function and shields will be useless.

                   Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they
                   smile with faint amusement.

 SPOCK                              What's sauce for the goose, Mr.
                             Saavik. The odds will be even.

                             fails to follow us into the nebula?

                   Kirk and Spock exchange looks --

 SPOCK                              I think we can guarantee she'll
                             follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me
                             to explain to you the concept of
                             human ego.

 KIRK                              Best speed, Scotty...

 BONES                              Listen to me, Pavel; you haven't
                             the strength or the equilibrium --

 CHEKOV                              But --

                   As they talk, David, unnoticed, leaves the area. The
                   Enterprise is buffeted again --

 CAROL                              Dr. McCoy, I can't just sit here.
                             Tell me what I can do.

 SPOCK                              One minute to nebula perimeter.

                   The bridge door slides open and David enters. He
                   stares in wonder. Saavik reacts to David.

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             Admiral, they're reducing speed.

 KIRK                              Uhura, patch me in --

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

 180 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 180 
 KHAN                              Why are we slowing?

 JOACHIM                              We daren't follow them into the
                             nebula, sir -- our shields will be
                             useless...

 KIRK'S VOICE                              This is Admiral Kirk.

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             We tried it once your way, Khan.
                             Are you game for a rematch?

                   Khan's eyes bulge --

 KIRK'S VOICE                                      (continuing)
                             Khan -- ! I'm laughing at the
                             "superior" intellect.

 KHAN                              Full impulse power!

 JOACHIM                              No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever
                             you want --

 KHAN                              Full power damn you!

                   And he reaches across and executes it himself.

 181 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 181 
                   They react to Reliant's speed-up. The nebula approach
                   is ON SCREEN.

 KIRK                                      (dry)
                             I'll say this for him: he's
                             consistent.

 182 EXT. SPACE - THE MUTARA NEBULA 182 
                   WE'RE VERY CLOSE NOW, and SEE CLEARLY the swirling,
                   slowly moving gases, magenta, purple, etc. There are
                   veils of luminescent materials and through all an
                   interlace of unpredictable electrical charges.

                   Like lightning, these intermittent great flashes
                   illumine whole sections of the nebula. OUR VIEW is
                   moving slowly forward...

 183 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 183 
 SPOCK                                      (timing)
                             And we're... in.

 184 EXT. SPACE - THE NEBULA 184 
                   As Enterprise whooshes into the PICTURE headed into the
                   purplish gas -- and disappears into a cloud bank of
                   the stuff.

                   A moment then Reliant APPEARS, pursues Enterprise into
                   the gloom, also disappears.

 185 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 185 
                   ON SCREEN the picture is squirrelly purple, breaking
                   up. Blindness. Panic.

 KHAN                              Tactical!

 JOACHIM                                      (tries)
                             Inoperative.

 KHAN                              Raise the shields...

                   Electrical forces raging without are also reflected on
                   the circuits within. It's bumpy, on top of everything
                   else. Electronic WHINING.

 JOACHIM                              As I feared, sir. Not functional.
                             I'm reducing speed.

                   Khan does not argue.

 186 EXT. SPACE - PURPLE - SERIES OF SHOTS 186 
                   Cautiously Reliant emerges from a massive "cloudbank."
                   Electrical discharges abound. Barely moving, she feels
                   her way forward. Alone.

 187 AS THE ANGLE WIDENS 187 
                   A treat: Enterprise is above and behind Reliant.

 188 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ON SCREEN 188 
                   Reliant's image is breaking up.

 SULU                              Phaser lock inoperative, sir.

 KIRK                              Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when
                             ready.

                   Sulu strains, then fires -- just as an electrical dis-
                   turbance bounces the bridge --

 189 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 189 
                   The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of
                   Reliant, amid CRACKLING discharges --

 190 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 190 
                   Rolls from the near-miss concussion --

 KHAN                              Aft-torpedoes -- fire -- !

 191 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 191 
                   Reliant is wide of the mark with a Photon torpedo.
                   A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE. When it clears,
                   Enterprise appears to be alone.

 192 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 192 
                   ON SCREEN, nothing but magenta amid picture breakup --

 KIRK                                      (sweating)
                             Hold your course. Look sharp...

 SAAVIK                              At what.

 193 EXT. NEBULA (INTERCUT WITH BRIDGE) 193 
                   Enterprise feeling its way...

 194 ON BRIDGE - POV ON SCREEN 194 
                   All peer into the lousy picture. Occasional electrical
                   flashes.

 195 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 195 
                   Still Enterprise moves forward... A LARGE FLASH... a
                   SUDDEN GLIMPSE: Reliant boring in on collision course!

 196 INT. ENTERPRSIE BRIDGE 196 
                   A sudden clearing ON SCREEN: Reliant!

 KIRK                              Evasive starboard!

                   Hard over, but not fast enough. Reliant fires a phaser.

 197 SERIES OF SHOTS 197 
                   Reliant's phaser shot hits the Enterprise torpedo room
                   in Dorsal Fin area of ship.

 198 INT. ENTERPRISE TORPEDO ROOM 198 
                   An EXPLOSION rocks the room and...

 199 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 199 
                   The Bridge rattles from the explosion below; Sulu is
                   thrown from his chair. Saavik leaps to her post --

 KIRK                              Phaser bank one, fire!

 200 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 200 
                   The Enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot
                   -- which rips along the side of Reliant's primary hull.

 200A INT. RELIANT BRIDGE (FORMERLY SCENE 205) 200A 
                   The bridge is damaged; Joachim and others are wounded...

 KHAN                              Joachim!

                   For the first time, his friend wounded, Khan hesitates,
                   holds him --

 JOACHIM                              Yours... is... the superior...

 KHAN                              I shall avenge you --

 200B NEW ANGLE 200B 
                   She veers to one side with the impact and disappears
                   into a deep purple mass.

 201 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 201 
                   Sulu is being helped by David --

 KIRK                              Damage, Scotty?

 202 INT. ENGINE ROOM 202 
                   Bones is there, helping some crewmen. The Reactor Room 
                   flashes a red warning light and glows with a blue 
                   light. The air is heavy with smoke but the doors,
                   damaged earlier, still hold.

 SCOTTY                              Admiral, I've got to take the mains
                             off the line. The energizer's shaken
                             loose and I can't get in there to
                             fix her -- radiation --

 203 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 203 
 KIRK                              All right, we'll do the job with
                             auxiliary power.

                   The bridge door opens and closes; Chekov, faint,
                   stands there.

 CHEKOV                              Could you use another hand, Admiral?

 KIRK                              Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

                   ANGLE FAVORING David as the others react to Chekov
                   taking his place. Quiet.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Spock?                             

                   Spock is bent over the scanner --

 SPOCK                              Sporadic energy readings port side,
                             aft. Could be an impulse turn.

 KIRK                              He won't break off now. If he
                             followed me this far he'll be back.
                             But from where...?

 SPOCK                              He's intelligent, but not experienced.
                             His pattern indicates two dimensional
                             thinking...

                   Kirk looks at him, smiles.

 KIRK                              Mr. Saavik, all stop.

 SAAVIK                              All stop, sir.

 KIRK                              Descend ten thousand meters. Stand
                             by photon torpedoes.

 204 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 204 
                   Reliant in purplish mass, banking slightly, completing
                   a long turn, then boring ahead.

 205 OMITTED 205 
 206 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 206 
                   As Reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear
                   almost tranquil place. Reliant, moving slowly, stops,
                   as if looking around.

 207 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 207 
                   The screens are empty.

 KHAN                              Where is he? Where in God's name
                             is he?

 208 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 208 
                   Reliant motionless in the f.g. amid occasional flashes.
                   Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale
                   rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,
                   slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy. When Enterprise
                   is above, behind and quite close:

 209 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 209 
                   Reliant ON SCREEN, intermittent but clear.

 CHEKOV                              Torpedoes ready, sir.

 KIRK                              Fire.

 210 SERIES OF SHOTS 210 
 A) EXT. ENTERPRISE 
                   fires torpedo; one which hits, destroying Reliant's
                   weapons pod on top.

 B) INT. RELIANT 
                   C)   EXPLOSIONS rock the interior of Reliant.

 D) EXT. ENTERPRISE 
                   fires two more times. The first causes general
                   damage. The second, close behind blasts Reliant's
                   port engine off into space, debris scattering.

 E) INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 
                   is devastated. Khan is blown from his chair and
                   WE'RE UNCERTAIN of his fate.

 211 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 211 
                   Reliant, now a scarred, battered hulk, her main hull
                   still intact, but dead in space.

 212 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 212 
                   No cheers, just deadly professionalism.

 KIRK                              Cease fire. Look sharp.

 SAAVIK                              Power levels quite low, sir.

 KIRK                                      (to intercom)
                             Mr. Scott, can you get the mains
                             back on line?

 SCOTTY'S VOICE                                      (breaking up slightly) 
                             I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til
                             the radiation dissipates.

 KIRK                              Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant:
                             prepare to be boarded.

 UHURA                              Aye, sir.

 213 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 213 
                   Amid the smoke and ruins, WE SEE no signs of life.

 UHURA'S VOICE                              Commander, Reliant, this is
                             Enterprise. Surrender and prepare
                             to be boarded. Repeat...

                   In f.g., chillingly, Khan rises INTO SHOT by the main
                   console. He is horribly burned, and it is clear that
                   he is clinging to life by his will.

 KHAN                              No... Kirk. The game's not over.

                   As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself
                   into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless
                   at his side.

 KHAN                                      (continuing)
                             To the last I will grapple with thee!

                   Painfully, with one good arm, he starts arming the
                   Genesis console.

 213A INT. RELIANT TRANSPORTER ROOM 213A 
                   There sits the Genesis torpedo: lights start blinking
                   in response. As we watch, the CHILD we met on Ceti Alpha
                   walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights.

 214 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 214 
 UHURA                              Enterprise to Reliant: you are
                             ordered to surrender your vessel.
                             Respond!
                                     (to Kirk)
                             Nothing, sir.

 KIRK                              We'll beam aboard. Alert

                             on Reliant. A pattern I've never
                             seen.

                   David peers closer over Spock's shoulder, reacts.

 DAVID                              It's the Genesis Wave!

 KIRK                              What?

 DAVID                              He's on a build up to detonation!

 KIRK                              How soon --

 DAVID                              We encoded four minutes --

 KIRK                              We'll beam aboard and stop it --

 DAVID                              You can't!

                   The briefest stunned moment. Kirk hits intercom:

 KIRK                              Scotty, I need warp speed in three
                             minutes or we're all dead!

 STATIC. 
 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Scotty!

                   Spock leaps from his place and disappears through the
                   bridge doors.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Saavik, get us out, best speed!

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 215 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 215 
                   Enterprise backs away from Reliant. Her speed is pain-
                   fully slow.

 216 INT. RELIANT BRIDGE 216 
                   ON SCREEN, Enterprise, intermittent image, backs away.
                   Khan smiles triumphantly through his pain. An elec-
                   tronic power SOUND has been building.

 KHAN                              No... You can't get away... From
                             hell's heart I stab at thee...
                                     (amid the pain)
                             For hate's sake... I spit my last
                             breath at thee!

                   Khan topples forward, dead. The WHINE continues to
                   build chillingly.

 217 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 217 
                   Spock rushes in. Bones ministers to Scotty, b.g.

                   Spock sizes up the situation, starts for the radiation
                   room, Bones intercepts him.

 BONES                              Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
                             No human can tolerate the radiation
                             loose in there!

 SPOCK                              But, as you are so fond of observing,
                             Doctor, I'm not human.

 BONES                              You're not going in there -- !

 SPOCK                              I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss
                             this logically --

                   He gives Bones the Vulcan nerve pinch. Bones goes
                   down.

                   Spock presses the access button and enters the Reactor
                   Room, a separated area behind radiation-proof glass
                   and metal, RED FLASHING LIGHTS and an iridescent blue
                   glow within.

 219 INT. ENTERPRISE REACTOR ROOM 219 
                   Bathed in blue light, arcing energy around him, Spock
                   is a silhouetted figure as he goes to work, door clos-
                   ing behind him.

 220 EXT. SPACE - RELIANT 220 
                   The WHINE increasing, the dead ship Reliant alive with

 223 INT. ENTERPRISE REACTOR ROOM (INTERCUT AS 223 REQUIRED) 
                   Outside the glass, Scotty and Bones screaming:

 SCOTTY                              Captain, please!

 BONES                              Get out! Get out, man! Oh, dear
                             God...!

 224 WITHIN 224 
                   WE CAN SEE the silent urging of Bones and Scotty.
                   Spock is oblivious. Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves 
                   to the control panel. Between his hands and the con-
                   trols, power arcs insanely. Spock is in an inferno,
                   a radiation hell, fighting now with all his strength
                   to control it. Slowly, the damping rods move out.
                   Spock moves to a manual control, begins to turn it.

 225 CLOSE - SPOCK'S HANDS 225 
                   on the manual control, slowly turning black.

 226 HIS FACE 226 
                   His face, using all the self discipline he is capable
                   of to control the pain, continuing to work --

 227 WITHOUT 227 
                   Bones and Scotty react in helpless horror.

 228 EXT. SPACE NEBULA 228 
                   Enterprise still well within the nebula, Reliant a
                   figure still visible in b.g. She's crawling still.

 229 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 229 
                   Reliant, now symbol of death, ON SCREEN.

 CHEKOV                              Four hundred kilometers.

                   Kirk looks at David, but David shakes his head: No
                   way. Then:

 CADET                              Sir! The mains are back on line -- !

 KIRK                              Bless you, Scotty. Go, Saavik!

 F) EXT. MUTARA NEBULA - MASTER EFFECT 
                        As Reliant goes, so goes the nebula. The "Genesis
                        Effect" WE SAW in its earliest experiments, now 
                        seems familiar on a gigantic, cosmic scale.

                        The blinding flash at first, followed by the same
                        tumbling turbulence of the miniature test. It is
                        awesome.

 231 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 231 
                   The bridge doors open and Carol appears. Instinctively
                   she draws near her son.

                   Finally, Kirk turns, sees Carol --

 KIRK                              Reduce speed. My God, Carl. Look
                             at it.

                   ON SCREEN and INTERCUT -- GENESIS TUMBLES and starts
                   evolving. A moment in history.

 KIRK                                      (continuing, on
                                      intercom)
                             Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?

 BONES' VOICE                                      (after a beat)
                             Jim, you'd better get down here. Hurry.

                   The tone frightens Kirk.

 KIRK                              Saavik, take the con.

                   He moves through the doors quickly, leaving the rest
                   staring at the new world evolving.

 232 INT. STAIRWAY TO ENGINE ROOM 232 
                   It is endless. Kirk runs forever, feet pounding down,
                   down, down --

                   The clouds tumble and move, new things lie beyond --

 235 INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM 235 
                   Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones. Their
                   looks tell him. He sees the flashing light over the
                   Reactor Room. He dashes for the control panel. Bones
                   grabs him.

 SCOTTY                              No, sir! You'll flood the whole
                             compartment...!

 KIRK                              He'll die -- !

 BONES                                      (also holds him)
                             He's dead already, Jim.

                   Kirk's eyes bulge.

 KIRK                              Oh, God.

 236 ANGLE AT REACTOR ROOM GLASS DOOR 236 
                   With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door,
                   sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked
                   with radiation lines and scars.

                   Spock shakes his head. With a feeble hand he reaches
                   the intercom button: filtered communication.

 KIRK                              Spock!

 SPOCK                              The ship -- out of danger?

 KIRK                              Yes --

                   Spock is satisfied; he fights for breath --

 SPOCK                              Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's
                             logical: the good of the many
                             outweighs --

                   He almost keels over. Kirk has tears streaming down
                   his face.

 KIRK                              ... the good of the few...

 SPOCK                              Or the one.

                   He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's
                   hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side
                   of the glass --

 SPOCK                                      (continuing)
                             I never took the Kobayashi Maru
                             test -- until now. What do you
                             think of my solution?

 KIRK                              Spock...!

 SPOCK                              I have been -- and always will be
                             -- your friend... Live. Long. And. 
                             Prosper.

                   Spock falls. Bones and Scotty react.

 KIRK                              No...!

 SAAVIK'S VOICE                                      (intercom)
                             Admiral, you've got to see this!
                             There's new life -- a whole new
                             world, a Genesis world -- !

                   But Kirk is past hearing or caring. He is huddled up
                   against the glass, destroyed. Bones looks on, helpless.

                   the Ship's Company in full dress uniforms assembled for
                   ship's burial service. Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:

 KIRK                              In accordance with the traditions
                             of Starfleet and of Article 184
                             Starfleet Regulations, we are
                             assembled here today to pay final
                             respects to our honored dead.

                   Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED. David watching
                   Kirk attentively. So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik.
                   Bones stands next to Kirk. Scotty carries his bagpipes.
                   Saavik wears her hair down.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             And yet, in the midst of our sorrow
                             it should be noted that this death
                             takes place in the shadow of new
                             life, the sunrise of a new world,
                             a world that our beloved comrade
                             gave his own life to protect and
                             nourish. He did not feel that
                             sacrifice a vain or empty one --
                             and we will not debate his profound
                             wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
                             my friend, I can only say this, that
                             of all the souls I have encountered 
                             in my travels, his was the most --
                                     (he falters)
                             -- human.

                   He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is
                   streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              We commend the soul of our brother
                             departed. We love we commit his
                             body to the depths of space.

 SULU                              Honors -- hup!

                   All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE,
                   an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk
                   nods a signal.

 242 THE CAPSULE 242 
                   A gleaming black projectile is carried by pallbearers
                   into the launching chamber, which locks behind it. At
                   a hand signal from a TORPEDOMAN, the projectile is fired.

 SULU                              Return -- hup!

                   The salute drop.

 KIRK                              Lieutenant.

                   She steps to him and they exchange salutes --

 KIRK                                      (continuing; very 
                                      quietly)
                             After you dismiss the company, you
                             will take the watch. Set course 
                             for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up 
                             survivors.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir.

 KIRK                              I'll be in my quarters if needed,
                             but I would prefer...

 SAAVIK                              Understood, sir.

 KIRK                                      (aloud)
                             Dismiss the company.

                   They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards
                   the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting 
                   orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and
                   he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally
                   understands.

 245 INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS 245 
                   After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He
                   pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

                   He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
                   Then he sees the book.

                   Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
                   friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly
                   he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he
                   can't see the writing -- he rummages through his
                   pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --

                   One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on
                   Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers
                   his eyes.

                   A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.

 KIRK                              Yes... come.

                   The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The
                   last person Kirk expected to see.

 DAVID                              I don't mean to intrude.

 KIRK                              Uh, no...
                                     (rises)
                             I should be on the bridge.

 DAVID                              Are you running away from me?

                   David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --

 KIRK                              I suppose I was.
                                     (pause)
                             I poured a drink. Would you like
                             it?

 DAVID                              No. I -- I guess I'm not what you
                             expected.

 KIRK                                      (rueful)
                             I didn't expect anything.

 DAVID                              That makes two of us.
                                     (he studies his
                                      father)
                             Lieutenant Saavik was right: you
                             never have faced death --

 KIRK                                      (hoarse)
                             Not like this -- no. I haven't faced
                             death, I cheated death. I tricked
                             my way out of death and patted myself
                             on the back for my ingenuity. I
                             know nothing.

 DAVID                              You knew enough to tell Saavik that
                             how we face death is at least as
                             important as how we face life --

 KIRK                              It was just words.

 DAVID                              But good words. That's where ideas
                             begin. Maybe you should listen to
                             them.

 KIRK                              I'm trying, David.

 DAVID                              So am I. My friends were killed,
                             too.

 KIRK                              I am truly sorry.

                   Pause. They study each other.

 DAVID                              I was wrong about you. And I'm
                             sorry.

 KIRK                              Is that what you came here to say?

 DAVID                              Mainly.
                                     (he starts out,
                                      then turns -- )
                             And also that I'm proud -- very
                             proud -- to be your son.

                   A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for
                   David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold-
                   ing onto him as if to life itself.

 246 EXT. SPACE 246 
                   The Enterprise passes the new planet in all its beauty.

 247 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE 247 
                   The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David
                   with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at
                   what they see.

 SAAVIK                              Admiral on the bridge!

 KIRK                              As you were, Mr. Saavik.

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha.
                             All is well.

 KIRK                              Good, I believe you already know
                             my, uh, son --

                   Saavik comes close to blushing --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Yes, well, why don't you show him
                             around and...

 SAAVIK                              Aye, sir --

                   She takes him off, deadpan amusement --

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             So you turn out to be the dumb
                             bastard.

                   They stare at her.

 SAAVIK                                      (continuing)
                             That is a little joke.

                   Kirk has a smile. He joins Bones and Carol facing the
                   screen.

 BONES                              She's changed her hair again.
                                     (pause)
                             Will you look at that? Think
                             they'll name it for you, Doctor?

 CAROL                              Not if I can help it. We'll name
                             it for our friend.

 KIRK                                      (quietly)
                             It is a far far better thing I do
                             than I have ever done before... a
                             far better resting place I go to
                             than I have ever known...

 CAROL                                      (soft)
                             Is that a poem?

 KIRK                              Something Spock was trying to
                             tell me. On my birthday.

                   He shakes his head, remembering --

 BONES                              You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

 KIRK                                      (considers; smiles)
                             Young. I feel young, Doctor.

                   He turns to Saavik and David --

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, new course: 'Second
                             star to the right and straight on
                             till morning.'

                                                               September 29, 1995





 1 A BLACK VOID 1 
                   We can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like
                   razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...
                   the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an
                   eerie, alien cacophony.

 2 EARTH 2 
                   appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The
                   alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear
                   the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion.
                   Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we
                   REVEAL we are in --

 3 INT. BORG RECON CENTER 3 
                   The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is
                   only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.
                   We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the
                   technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
                   a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.
                   Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
                   what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can
                   still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.
                   Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,
                   vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.

                   All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad
                   IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The
                   screens show everything from written Chinese... to
                   Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel
                   footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of
                   space battles from the 24th century. The entire range
                   of human history dancing across the monitors. The
                   effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
                   is watching this is studying the human race.

                   There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
                   SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will
                   come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
                   voices speaking at once :

 BORG                              Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
                             9-8 through 2-0-8-4.

                   The images on the monitors now change to show us images
                   from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.

                   Again, it's a collection of still photography, video
                   footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-
                   bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of
                   enticing details. As the images race across the
                   monitors, we should learn the following.

                   -- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.
                   Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.
                   Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.

                   -- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
                   environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The
                   United States ceases to exist. All political authority
                   vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
                   Dark Age.

                   -- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
                   visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created
                   out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp
                   test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.

                   -- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
                   landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
                   him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the
                   human race.

                   -- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an
                   alien civilization brings the planet together as never
                   before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning
                   to solve long-standing problems with new technology.
                   We see an early replicator producing food for the
                   starving millions. A new World Government is formed.

                   -- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
                   an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of 
                   Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for
                   protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.

                   -- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
                   Trek universe.

                   Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES
                   the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a
                   shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's
                   voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic
                   inflection, speaks for the first time:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Stop search. Calculate temporal
                             coordinates. J-Fourteen.

                   Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to:

 4 EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE 4 
                   A huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser
                   shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the
                   Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The
                   Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

 5 A FEDERATION STARSHIP 5 
                   locked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire
                   DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.

 6 NEW ANGLE 6 
                   as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
                   decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this
                   is just one small part of --

 7 A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE 7 
                   involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged
                   in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships
                   turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. 
                   It's a spectacular sight.

                   The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading
                   off in another direction.
 8 NEW ANGLE 8 
                   In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking
                   a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking
                   quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it
                   doesn't look like it can take much  more of this.

                   Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in
                   from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship,
                   causing massive damage.

 9 THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E 9 
                   SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
                   starship.

                   The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful
                   vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the
                   last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more
                   muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
                   and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this
                   Enterprise is ready for anything.

 10 INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE 10 
                   The Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's
                   chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and
                   stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard
                   instant access to his officers. PICARD in the
                   Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at
                   the helm. WORF at Tactical. TROI at Communications,
                   various CREWMEMBERS at their posts. The ship is at Red
                   Alert and everyone is tense.

 PICARD                              Signal the Endeavor to fall back.
                             We'll cover them.

                   The Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the
                   Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section. This should
                   also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the
                   traditional "bubble" shielding, the new armor of this
                   Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy
                   across the hull. The ship is undamaged.

 12 INT. BRIDGE 12 
                   The ship is ROCKED by the blast.

                   look different, more along the lines of a gatling gun).

 GEORDI                              Captain, I'm starting to worry
                             about the hull integrity. We've

                   Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the
                   INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE. A vast CHAMBER crammed with
                   HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual
                   alcoves. They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls,
                   floor. This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg
                   that form a gigantic "hive" mind. The Borg are half-
                   man/half machine. No individual personalities. No
                   feelings. They have only one goal in life: to
                   assimilate new races into their collective. To become
                   a Borg is to experience living death. When they speak,
                   they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices
                   speaking as one:

 BORG                              Your defense perimeter is
                             useless. You will be assimilated.

 PICARD                                      (to Borg)

                             you must realize you can't win...

 BORG                              Your opinion is irrelevant. We
                             are the Borg. Resistance is
                             futile.
 PICARD                              We'll see about that...

 19 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - CLOSE ON TORPEDO BAY 19 
                   A QUANTUM TORPEDO BLASTS out of the launcher and heads
                   toward the Borg cube. This torpedo is completely
                   different than the traditional photon torpedo. It
                   oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks 
                   toward the Borg ship.
 20 THE BORG SHIP 20 
                   as the quantum torpedo HITS IT. But instead of
                   exploding on the surface, the torpedo PIERCES the ship
                   like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily VANISHES
                   from view. The ship then EXPLODES like a star going
                   supernova -- bright light and shock waves.

 21 INT. BRIDGE 21

                   The satellites open fire, but they have little effect
                   on the massive Borg Sphere, which returns fire,

                             past... they went back and
                             changed history...

 RIKER                                      (stunned)
                             They did it... they assimilated
                             Earth.

 WORF                              But if they changed history...
                             then why are we still here?

 DATA                              We were caught in the temporal
                             wake from the vortex. It must
                             have protected us from any changes
                             in the time-line.

                   Worf's console sounds an alarm.

 WORF                              Captain, there are five Borg ships
                             closing in on our position.

 PICARD                                      (making a decision)
                             Data, set a course for that
                             vortex.

 TROI                              Captain...?

 PICARD                              We have to follow them back...
                             repair whatever damage they've
                             done to that time-line.

                   The ship is suddenly ROCKED.

              33   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & BORG SHIPS (OPTICAL)              33

                   The Enterprise is being chased by FIVE BORG SHIPS as it
                   heads down toward the planet. The Borg vessels FIRE on
                   the Enterprise.

 34 INT. BRIDGE 34 
                   As before. The ship is shaking.

 WORF                              Hull integrity down to thirty
                             percent...

 PICARD                              Steady as she goes.

 35 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) 35 
                   Ahead of the ship, we see the VORTEX collapsing. The
                   shaking increases. A console EXPLODES.
 WORF                              Borg vessels are closing to two
                             thousand meters.

                   The ship is HIT AGAIN AND AGAIN. On the View Screen,
                   we're nearly on the vortex, but it's closing fast.

 PICARD                              Take us in!

              36   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & VORTEX (OPTICAL)                  36

                   The Enterprise just barely makes it inside the vortex
                   as it finally COLLAPSES. Both the Enterprise and the
                   vortex VANISH.

 CUT TO:

                   An empty star field. Suddenly, the VORTEX APPEARS and
                   the Enterprise comes ROARING out into space. The
                   vortex VANISHES behind the ship.

 38 INT. BRIDGE 38 
                   The shaking subsides. Everyone exchanges a look, tries
                   to re-orient themselves.
 PICARD                              Report.

 RIKER                              We're still in Earth orbit.

                   Which shows Earth. The Borg pollution is gone.

 PICARD                              What year is it?

                             According to our astrometric
                             readings... the year is 2063.

 WORF                              Captain, I've found the Borg
                             Sphere. It's on the far side of
                             the planet...firing at the
                             surface.

                             Weapons status?

 WORF                              Phasers are off-line... we have
                             two quantum torpedoes left. But
                             the computer targeting system has
                             been destroyed.

 PICARD                              Go to manual.

                   Worf pops open a panel and a high-tech TARGETING console
                   emerges with a small MONITOR and a traditional CROSS-
                   HAIR in the center. Worf grabs the targeting hand-
                   controls -- futuristic joysticks.

 40 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE 40 
                   The ship is FIRING its weapons down toward the planet
                   as the Enterprise comes up over the horizon.

 41 INT. BRIDGE 41 
                   As before. Worf works his controls. A complex array
                   of grids, coordinate information, speed data, and other
                   weapons info on the monitor screen. He begins trying
                   to focus the cross-hairs on the Sphere.

 PICARD                                      (over above action, to

 RIKER                              They've seen us. They're taking
                             evasive action.

                             Mister Worf?

                   Worf struggles with the targeting system.

 WORF                              Target...

                   The crosshairs keep missing the image of the Borg
                   Sphere, which is now twisting and turning to evade us.
                   Troi reacts to her console.

 TROI                              Captain, they're firing at a
                             nuclear missile silo... in central
                             Montana.

 WORF                                     (struggling)

                   The crosshairs finally LOCK on the Borg Sphere.

 WORF                              Target locked!

 PICARD                              Fire!

                   The quantum torpedo streaks in from off-camera and
                   slams into the Borg ship. It penetrates the Sphere as
                   seen before... a long beat... and then it EXPLODES.

 43 INT. BRIDGE 43 
                   As everyone reacts to the destruction of the Sphere.
                   But Picard has no time for celebration.

 PICARD                                      (to Data)
                             Mister Data, I want to know the

                                     (to Riker)
                             Give me a damage report on that
                             missile silo.

                             Looks like they damaged the

 PICARD                              Life signs?

 RIKER                              Can't tell. Long-range bio-
                             sensors are off-line.

                   Picard thinks for a moment... makes an instant decision
                   and turns to Worf.

 PICARD                              Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister
                             La Forge and a security team meet
                             me in Transporter Room Three.
                             Civilian clothes.

 WORF                              Aye, sir.

                   Worf works. Riker turns to him, curious.

 RIKER                              Captain?

 PICARD                              In twenty-four hours, Zephram
                             Cochrane is supposed to conduct
                             the very first warp test... from
                             a missile silo in Montana. If I'm
                             right, the Borg were trying to
                             change the course of human history
                             by killing him or destroying his
                             ship.

 RIKER                                      (nods in understanding)
                             And if they succeed, humans won't
                             make First Contact with the
                             Vulcans tomorrow.
                                     (beat)
                             As First Officer I should be the
                             one beaming down...

 PICARD                              Normally, I would agree. But in
                             this case, the mission requires a
                             certain knowledge of 21st century
                             history. You're many things,
                             Number One, but you're not much of
                             an historian.

                   He grins slightly, has to agree.

 RIKER                              Good luck, sir.

 PICARD                              I'll keep in contact. You have
                             the Bridge.

                   Picard EXITS...

 CUT TO:

                   Picard, Geordi and THREE SECURITY GUARDS are checking

                   frazzled - it's been a long day in Sickbay.

 BEVERLY                              Will somebody please tell me where 
                             we're going?

                   Beverly joins them on the pad.

                             everything. Why the hell are we --

                   They DEMATERIALIZE.

                   Picard, Geordi, Beverly and the Security Team
                   MATERIALIZE on the vast, rolling plains of Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (continuing)
                             -- going to Montana?

                   Picard and Geordi take out their tricorders and start
                   scanning the landscape.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                             I have the silo, sir. Bearing

 PICARD                              Let's go.

                   They start walking...

 BEVERLY                              Go where? Hello? Is anyone going
                             to tell me what we're doing here?

 PICARD                              We're here to find Zephram
                             Cochrane. He may be injured or
                             dead.

 BEVERLY                              Cochrane... the inventor of warp
                             drive?

 PICARD                              Yes...

 BEVERLY                              But he's been dead for three
                             hundred...
                                     (realizes, long sigh)
                             Oh God... we've gone back in time
                             again, haven't we?

 PICARD                              I'm afraid so. If the Borg
                             succeed in preventing First
                             Contact with the Vulcans... Earth
                             will remain in the Second Dark
                             Age... an easy target when the
                             Borg arrive in the 24th century.

 BEVERLY                              Well, why didn't you just say so
                             in the first place?

                   Picard gives her a look. As they keep walking...

                             I'll note in her record that she
                             never left her post.

                   Troi glances at Data, who is clearly disturbed by the
                   sight of the dead woman, holding his EMOTIONS in check
                   with difficulty.

 TROI                              Did you know her?

 DATA                              Not very well. We met shortly
                             after the Enterprise-E was
                             commissioned. I found her to be
                             a most... promising officer.

                   Troi looks at him in concern.

 TROI                              Data... are you sure you're all
                             right?

 DATA                              I am still having difficulty
                             integrating certain emotions into
                             my programming. Grief, loss,
                             remorse...

 TROI                              We still have to make reports on
                             ten more crewmen killed in action.
                             Maybe you should deactivate your
                             emotion chip until we're done.

                   Data considers.

 DATA                              No. Human beings do not have that
                             luxury, and neither should I.

 TROI                              I will admit... there are times
                             when I wish I had an emotion chip
                             I could turn on and off.

 49 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 49 
                   A WIDE SHOT of the ship. CAMERA CLOSES ON the AFT
                   SECTION of the ship, moving underneath of the hull,
                   pushing in on an area at the very bottom of the
                   Enterprise.

 50 INT. ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL 50 
                   Data and ENSIGN PORTER ENTER through a set of doors.
                   The lights are off in the room, dim. This is a large
                   room crammed with many conduits, gas tanks, 24th
                   century machinery and monitors. It's normally unmanned --
                   this is where oxygen, gravity, heat, and other
                   environmental conditions of the ship are controlled.
                   In a far corner of the room a CONDUIT leading to a
                   series of high-pressure TANKS labeled "D-O2" has
                   ruptured and is SPEWING a corrosive, poisonous GAS.

                   Data scans it with his tricorder.

 DATA                                       (to Porter)
                             One of the diathermic oxygen tanks
                             has been damaged.

 PORTER                                       (shocked)
                             Diathermic oxygen?

                             hydropressure and temperature
                             variance.

                             Remain here. The gas is highly
                             corrosive to organic material. It
                             would liquefy your flesh on
                             contact.

 PORTER                              Be my guest, sir.

                   Data walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without
                   concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas...

                   ... groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs
                   hold of it... and with android strength BENDS the metal
                   conduit back into the bulkhead. The gas stops leaking.
                   Data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas.

 PORTER                              Right.

                   Porter moves around a corner, behind some equipment,
                   out of Data's vision...

 51 NEW ANGLE - PORTER 51 
                   who opens a PANEL on the wall. But instead of the neat
                   and orderly Starfleet technology, he is confronted by
                   a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling,
                   diodes and what almost look like arteries. Some of the
                   tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy. Porter
                   reacts.

 PORTER                              What the hell...

                   Porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops. Buried
                   deep within the tangle of bio-circuits is what looks
                   like a HUMAN FACE covered with cybernetic tubes and
                   chips. It's barely discernable in the darkness and
                   clutter. Porter isn't even sure what he's looking at.
                   He leans in for a closer look... and suddenly the eyes
                   open.

 52 DATA 52 
                   who hears a THUMP and a sickening liquid CRUNCH from
                   off camera. He takes a few steps in that direction.

 DATA                              Ensign Porter?

                   He stands there for a moment, puzzled. Then a faint
                   SKITTERING SCRAPE can be heard -- like tiny claws on a
                   metal surface. He  whirls at the sound.

 DATA                              Ensign... are you all right?

                   No response. Data walks around the now deathly quiet
                   room... turns the corner to where Porter was working.
                   He's gone. The open panel is still there, and there
                   doesn't appear to be any place Porter could've gone.
                   Data looks puzzled, takes a step forward when his boots
                   make a squishing sound. He looks down...

                   Nothing. Data quickly turns and heads for the door.
                   There's a metallic SCRAPE above him and he looks up --

 53 TWO BORG 53 
                   are climbing to the ceiling like two spiders ready to
                   pounce. One of them has Porter and appears to be
                   inserting some horrible Borg device into his head.
                   Before Data can react, the second Borg suddenly lunges
                   at Data.

 CUT TO: 
 54 EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - MISSILE SILO - DAY 54 
                   The SILO is buried deep underground, but on the surface
                   there is a large, poured concrete MISSILE DOOR.

                   Built to withstand a nuclear blast, the door has
                   nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the Borg
                   attack from orbit. There are large, smoking CRATERS
                   all around. Part of the ground seems to have COLLAPSED
                   to a depth of ten feet, like a sinkhole nearby. Picard
                   and his team approach.

 GEORDI                              This must be it.

 PICARD                              How serious is the damage?

 GEORDI                                       (off tricorder)
                             I'm having trouble scanning
                             underground. There's a lot of
                             radiation leaking from something.

 PICARD                              Probably from the nuclear warhead.
                             Cochrane was planning to use it to
                             ignite the warp drive.

                   As they speak, Beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
                   everyone injections.

 BEVERLY                              This will protect us from the
                             radiation.

                   Geordi moves to the thick, concrete missile door, scans
                   it.

 GEORDI                              I'm picking up faint life signs
                             twenty meters below.

 PICARD                              There should be an access hatch
                             nearby...

                   Everyone spreads out... looking for the hatch. One of
                   the guards -- LANGE -- finds it.

 LANGE                              Over here.

                   Everyone rushes over to him. There's a small HATCH on
                   the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and
                   brush. Geordi kneels down, starts working a complex-
                   looking LOCK on the hatch.

 GEORDI                              Alphanumeric lock. We need a
                             password to get in...

 PICARD                              I have the password right here.

                   Picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back.
                   He aims and FIRES at the hatch, which is BLOWN OPEN,
                   revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness.
                   As they start to crawl inside...
 55 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 55 
                   This is the "mission control" for Cochrane's test site.
                   The underground room is filled with 21st century
                   equipment, consoles and monitors. One entire wall of
                   the room is dominated by a huge METAL BLAST DOOR, which
                   is now closed. We will learn that on the other side of
                   that door is the nuclear missile/warp ship itself.

                   The ceiling has partially collapsed. Chunks of
                   concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
                   equipment...Only a few of the consoles are active, most
                   are dark or fritzing sporadically. The lights are out,
                   and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires.
                   Four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room.
                   It's a scene of destruction.

 56 PICARD 56 
                   and his team ENTER the dark and smoking ruin. Beverly
                   and Picard move to one of the dead men, while Geordi
                   and the Security Guards move to the other three.
                   Beverly rolls the man onto his back -- he's clearly
                   dead. The name stitched on his uniform says Rippert.
                   Picard looks up.

 PICARD                                       (to others)
                             See if any of these men are
                             Cochrane.

                   Geordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies.

 GEORDI                              Mitchell... DePaul...

 LANGE                              This one's a woman... named Kirby.

                   Picard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door.
                   As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk...
 57 THE DESK 57 
                   is littered with debris and various documents and
                   schematics. THREE PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned to a bulletin
                   board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and
                   two angles of his warp ship. The photos are odd-
                   looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of
                   cloth.

 BEVERLY                              There's a life sign behind this
                             door... about ten meters below.

                   Geordi moves to the door.

 GEORDI                              Blast door. It's designed to
                             protect the control room when the
                             missile is launched.

 PICARD                              There should be some kind of
                             manual release...

                   They hunt around for a moment. Geordi runs his hand
                   along the edge of the blast door. Picard turns to the
                   Guards.

 PICARD                                       (to Lange)
                             Get those fires out and then try
                             to restore main power to the
                             control room.

 LANGE                              Aye, sir.

                   The Guards move off.

 GEORDI                              Got it, Captain.

                   Geordi has found an emergency BOX with several
                   pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
                   "emergency use only." He pulls down the lever, there
                   is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly SLIDES
                   DOWN into the floor. We can now see the MISSILE SILO
                   itself beyond the door. Picard, Geordi and Beverly
                   step into...

 58 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS 58 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which
                   surrounds the Silo walls. In the middle is the WARP
                   SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM
                   missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and
                   with numerous modifications to the fuselage. The
                   cockpit is on the same level as the control room. On
                   the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix". The
                   missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES.
                   There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders
                   connecting the different levels. Beverly sees
                   something below.

 BEVERLY                              There.

 59 NEW ANGLE 59 
                   Two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
                   grating. They all scramble down the ladders past the
                   massive missile. (NOTE: Because of the design of the
                   Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few
                   shots. For the most part, our view is limited to
                   sections of the missile.)

                   Beverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the
                   metal grating. She scans him...

 BEVERLY                              Severe radiation exposure...

                   Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
                   their level. The side panels have been removed,
                   revealing complex circuitry within.

                   Picard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man.
                   It's ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw
                   on the Borg monitors. Beverly begins pulling devices
                   out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray.
                   Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties. He has a
                   youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
                   burns.

 PICARD                              It's Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                              I've stabilized him for now... but
                             he's in a coma and he's going to
                             need radiometric therapy. I want
                             to take him to the ship.

                   Picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out
                   a combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise.
                                      (no response)
                             Enterprise, please respond.

 GEORDI                              It could be the radiation,
                             Captain. Try from the surface.

                   Picard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to
                   orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at
                   stake and a lot to do. He turns to Geordi.

 PICARD                              Mister La Forge, listen very
                             carefully. If you remember your
                             history... in less than twenty-
                             four hours, a Vulcan ship will be
                             passing through this system. When
                             it does, this ship needs to be in
                             space, flying at warp speed.

                   Geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order.

 GEORDI                              I'd better get started.

                   Geordi goes to work. Picard bends down and carefully
                   hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry. Beverly
                   follows him up the catwalk...

 CUT TO: 60 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 60 
                   Minutes later. Cochrane is lying on the ground.
                   Beverly is kneeling beside him, unfolding a portable
                   stretcher from her medkit. Picard is checking two
                   combadges with a tricorder.

 PICARD                              It's not the radiation... and
                             there's nothing wrong with the
                             combadges... the Enterprise just
                             isn't responding.

 BEVERLY                              Jean-Luc, this man needs medical
                             attention, now.

 PICARD                              As I recall, the town of
                             Resurrection is about two
                             kilometers East of here. They
                             might have a hospital...

                   Picard looks troubled at the thought.

 BEVERLY                              What are we waiting for? Let's
                             go.

 PICARD                              It may not be that simple. This
                             is an extremely difficult and
                             paranoid time in human history.

 BEVERLY                              Are you saying they won't help us?

 PICARD                              I'm saying they might shoot us on
                             sight. You have to remember...
                             these people have watched their
                             entire way of life collapse around
                             them.

 BEVERLY                              There must be some good people...
                             even in this time.

 PICARD                              Let's hope so. Because if
                             Cochrane dies... the future may
                             die with him.

                   Picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put
                   Cochrane on the stretcher...
 CUT TO: 
 61 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 61 
                   Riker, Troi and Worf studying a MONITOR which shows a
                   three-dimensional DIAGRAM of the Enterprise, which
                   turns and rotates as needed. The schematic shows
                   battle damage and repair efforts.

 WORF                              I have assigned two damage control
                             teams to locate the source of our
                             communication problems. So far,
                             they've had no success.

 RIKER                              Assign another team if you need
                             to. I want to re-establish
                             communication with the Captain as
                             soon as possible.

                   Worf nods and begins making notes on a PADD.

 TROI                              Are we in any danger of being
                             detected by Earth defense systems?

 WORF                              There were no planetary defense
                             systems in this era. Their
                             weapons were designed to
                             fight each other... not
                             extraterrestrials.

 RIKER                              We have to start thinking about a
                             way to get home.
                                      (to Troi)
                             Analyze our readings from the
                             temporal vortex. We're going to
                             have to recreate whatever the Borg
                             did to --

                   Just then the ship SHUDDERS and the LIGHTS FLICKER.

 RIKER                               Report.

 TROI                                       (off console)
                             We just lost main power... and
                             we've got Class-Three alerts all
                             over the ship. I'm not sure
                             what's --

                   An ALARM goes off on Worf's console. He reacts to it.

 WORF                              A ship-wide decompression has been
                             initiated!

 RIKER                              What?

 TROI                              We're venting our internal
                             atmosphere directly into space!

 62 EXT. ENTERPRISE 62 
                   CLOSE ON THE SAUCER as vents and hatches POP OPEN on
                   the hull and GIANT JETS OF VAPOR start blowing out
                   into space.

 63 INT. CORRIDOR 63 
                   Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the
                   floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the
                   Corridor. The ship is venting air into space, creating
                   a virtual VACUUM inside the ship! The people in the
                   corridor grab onto the bulkheads, struggling to hang on
                   against the force of the wind...

 64 INT. BRIDGE 64 
                   Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS.
                   VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone
                   hangs on. Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown
                   across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead,
                   struggling to hang on. Worf runs over, grabs her arm,
                   keeps her from flying out.

                   Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button
                   and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the
                   airlock and the wind DIES DOWN. Everyone takes a beat.

 RIKER                              What the hell is happening, Worf?

 WORF                                       (off console)
                             It appears that someone has taken
                             over the Environmental Control
                             Room.

 TROI                              Someone...?

 RIKER                                       (realizing)
                             The Borg.  Some of them must've
                             beamed over before we destroyed
                             their ship.
                                      (to Worf)
                             Seal off that entire deck with
                             emergency force fields.

 TROI                              Wil... Data was down there.

 RIKER                                       (to Worf)
                             Mister Worf... find Data if you
                             can, but your top priority is
                             isolating the Borg.

 WORF                              Understood.

                   Worf heads for a Turbolift. OFF Riker's disturbed
                   expression...

 CUT TO: 
 65 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE 65 
                   His eyes are closed. There's a beat, then his eyes fly
                   open and he looks around.

                   We PULL BACK slightly, revealing Data is lying on some
                   kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints.
                   He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable
                   to break the restraints. About two feet in front of
                   his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a
                   cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching,
                   hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...

                   Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as
                   it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside
                   down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment
                   as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.

 66 DATA'S POV 66 
                   As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And
                   we realize we're in --
 67 INT. BORG HIVE 67 
                   The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now
                   been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG.
                   The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical
                   jungle of cybernetic equipment.

                   The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet
                   technology and materials into the living, bio-
                   mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone
                   attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
                   it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
                   BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
                   inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower
                   bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.

                   The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
                   the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg
                   drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and
                   other conduits connecting them to various equipment...
                   while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying
                   out various modifications to the room. At one point,
                   we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified.
                   His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity
                   left.

 68 DATA 68 
                   still strapped to the table, which is twisting and
                   rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the
                   room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are
                   clustered together in one section of the room, each
                   with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
                   connected to its face.

                   Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and
                   ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre
                   "feeding" or "renewal" is going on. The tubes all seem
                   to lead toward the ceiling.

                   Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS
                   into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side
                   of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of
                   optical cabling to it.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             Your efforts to assimilate me will
                             be unsuccessful.

                   The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the
                   cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power.
                   They're trying to connect him to the Collective.

                   Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly...
                   and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the
                   cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the
                   cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             It would appear that resistance is
                             not always futile.

                   Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room -- 
                   a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Brave words. I've heard them
                             before from thousands of species
                             across thousands of worlds...
                             since long before you were
                             created.

                   Data looks up toward...

 69 THE CEILING 69 
                   A RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle...
                   almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. And
                   for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike
                   any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale-
                   skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back...
                   a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish
                   technology. And then it's gone.

                   Frowns. He saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make
                   of it.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              But now... they are all one with
                             the Borg.

 DATA                              I am unlike any lifeform you have
                             encountered before. As an
                             android, I am in complete control
                             of my neural net. The information
                             contained there cannot be forcibly
                             removed.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              You are an imperfect being...
                             created by an imperfect being.
                             Finding your weakness is only a
                             matter of time.

                   Suddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with
                   various wicked-looking Borg devices. One of the Borg
                   has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a
                   series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES. As the six-
                   inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Data's head...

 71 EXT. MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 71 
                   Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people --
                   a rural, Western community that's probably existed for
                   at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of
                   the original ranching community in some of the
                   architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st
                   century.

                   The most striking feature of the town is that it sits
                   in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which
                   provide the only source of power for the town. The
                   blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them
                   are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek,
                   fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled
                   together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only
                   a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.

                   Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods
                   carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the
                   sight of the city and then head toward it...

 72 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 72 
                   A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying
                   Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
                   end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of
                   post-apocalyptic 21st century life:

                   This is a recognizable American community, but it's
                   definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,
                   technology -- all have changed over the course of
                   seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used
                   to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
                   and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
                   CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements
                   now useless.

                   At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
                   the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
                   can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The
                   entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later
                   we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the
                   only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.

                   What used to be a McDonald's, or some other
                   recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has
                   been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are
                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
                   tongs.

                   The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate
                   in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,
                   others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of
                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
                   victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental
                   dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion
                   to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
                   elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as
                   people line up to get their daily rations.

                   A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
                   curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community
                   that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man
                   dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
                   weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He
                   stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks
                   off.

                   The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look
                   about them. They're going through something that makes
                   the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.
                   But there's also a toughness to these people, a
                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of
                   overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and
                   it's on the verge of collapse.

 CUT TO: 
 73 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 73 
                   A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an
                   operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the
                   table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The
                   doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered,
                   tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the
                   rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard
                   times. The light in the room is provided mostly from
                   the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light
                   bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital --
                   we get the feeling they have very little power.

 DOCTOR                              How long has he been unconscious?

 BEVERLY                              At least four hours.

                   He checks Cochran's head injury as Beverly takes out
                   her tricorder and scans him.

 DOCTOR                              It looks like he has a cranial
                             fracture, but I'll need X-rays to
                             be sure.
                                      (to Nurse)
                             Get Ruby in here.

                   One of the nurses runs off.

 BEVERLY                                       (off tricorder)
                             He has a severe fracture of the
                             left occipital plate. He's not
                             hemorrhaging... but the radiation
                             has damaged his KNA and his APR
                             cell count...

                   He looks at her curiously.

 DOCTOR                              "APR cell count?" What the hell
                             are you talking about?

 PICARD                                      (quickly)
                             Doctor Crusher has been...
                             studying some advanced medical
                             theories.

 NURSE                                      (re: tricorder)
                             What is that?

 BEVERLY                              It's a... new medical scanner.
                             It's a little more precise than an
                             X-ray machine.

                   The Doctor eyes it.

 DOCTOR                              Is it Japanese?

 BEVERLY                              Um... yeah.
                                     (beat)
                             Now he's going to need a
                             respirator. Do you have one?

 DOCTOR                              We have two... but we don't have
                             the juice to run them.

 PICARD                              Juice?

 DOCTOR                              Power. There hasn't been a lot of
                             wind through here for the last
                             couple of weeks. Most of the
                             batteries are depleted.

 BEVERLY                              Don't you have any generators, or
                             other fuel sources?

                   The Doctor throws her an irritated look.

 DOCTOR                              Maybe you'd like to take your
                             patient to the hospital in
                             Bozemen... it's only two hundred
                             miles away.

                   Cochrane wheezes -- breathing becoming labored and
                   ragged. Beverly scans him, urgent.

 BEVERLY                              His automatic reflexes are
                             fluctuating. We've got to get him
                             on a respirator.

 DOCTOR                                      (to Nurse)
                             Bag him.

                   The nurse picks up a portable respirator sack -- puts
                   it on Cochrane's face and squeezes the bag, forcing air
                   into Cochrane's lungs. Picard has been thinking
                   through this scene, finally has a solution.
 PICARD                              Beverly -- your tricorder.

                   She hands him her tricorder.

 PICARD                                     (to Doctor)
                             Where's the battery room for the
                             hospital?

 DOCTOR                              I told you, there's no --

 PICARD                              Where?

 DOCTOR                              Outside, around back. Next to the
                             water tank.
                    Picard rushes out the doors. Beverly checks Cochrane's
                   pulse.

 BEVERLY                              His heartbeat's irregular...
                    Beverly climbs up on top of Cochrane, straddling him,
                   begins giving him 24th century CPR. She takes charge.
 BEVERLY                              Adrenaline -- ten CC's!

                   As they rush to save him.
 74 EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 74 
                   The back of the building. Picard rushes out and spots
                   an old, dilapidated BATTERY UNIT providing power to the
                   hospital. He quickly yanks off the back panel,
                   revealing a tangle of wires, and several large
                   batteries. He kneels down, then removes the back of
                   the tricorder.
 75 CLOSE ON TRICORDER 75 
                   as Picard pulls out a small POWER CELL -- about half
                   the size of a dime. The blinkies on the tricorder go
                   out.

 76 PICARD 76 
                   holds the power cell with one hand, and starts pulling
                   out wires from the batteries with the other.

 77 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 77 
                   As before. Beverly, the doctor and the nurse trying to
                   save Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                                      (pumping his chest)
                             One... two... three... compress!

                   The nurse squeezes the bag. Suddenly the room is
                   filled with the HUM of POWER and ALL OF THE LIGHTS AND
                   EQUIPMENT COME TO LIFE. Monitors blinking, fluorescent
                   lights flashing on. Everyone reacts with shock.

 78 INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY 78 
                   It's filled with patients. The lights and equipment
                   here FLASH ON, as well. Doctors and patients alike
                   react with surprise.

 79 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 79 
                   Picard enters. They've placed a RESPIRATOR down
                   Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his
                   chest. Beverly has just finished giving him an
                   injection with a hypospray. The heart monitor in the
                   background is now beating regularly. The doctor turns
                   to Picard.

 DOCTOR                              What did you do to the batteries?

 PICARD                              Oh... just a little tinkering.
                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                              He's stable... for now.
                                     (with meaning)
                             But it would be better if we could
                             contact... our friends.

 PICARD                              Yes. But until then, you'll have
                             to make do with what you've got.

 BEVERLY                              That'll be interesting.

 A WOMAN'S VOICE: 
 RUBY'S VOICE                              What happened to him?

                   Everyone turns.

 80 NEW ANGLE 80 
                   revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of
                   Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late
                   thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under
                   normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her
                   best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard
                   day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the
                   most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence
                   we can see in her eyes.

                   She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard
                   realizes he has to say something. He looks into her
                   eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of
                   chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just
                   might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that
                   electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer.

 PICARD                              There was some kind of explosion
                             out at the missile silo...

                   She looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him
                   without expression, as though probing the truthfulness
                   of his statement.

 DOCTOR                              Ruby, we're going to need a series 
                             of cranial X-rays tonight.

 RUBY                                      (nods)
                             I have a fresh set of plates at
                             home. I'll have them here by
                             eight.

                   She turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently
                   takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection.

 RUBY                                      (quiet)
                             Take care of him. He's a very
                             special man.

 PICARD                              Yes, he is.

                   She looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight
                   feeling of chemistry in the air. And then she turns
                   and starts to walk out of the room. Picard's combadge
                   BEEPS. Reactions.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              La Forge to Picard.

 RUBY                                      (stopping)
                             I think there's someone in your
                             pants.

 PICARD                              Excuse me. I have a... telephone
                             call.

                   Picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out
                   of his pants pocket, taps it. Ruby watches him a beat,
                   then walks out of the room.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              Captain, we have a problem. I
                             think you'd better get back here.

 PICARD                              I'm on my way. Picard out.

                   Picard moves to Beverly.

 PICARD                                      (sotto)
                             I have to go back to the silo.
                             Will you be all right?

 BEVERLY                              I'll be fine.
                                     (re: Cochrane)
                             He's a different story.

                   Beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll
                   have to work with as Picard exits...

 81 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY 81 
                   A short time later. Picard walking down the main
                   street back toward the gates. People passing him,
                   taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking
                   ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then
                   he stops.

 82 NEW ANGLE 82 
                   Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious
                   woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera
                   bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a
                   moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover
                   car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made
                   FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of
                   the car. She continues on her way. Picard is
                   intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is
                   she could be taking a picture of. Just then --

 MAN'S VOICE                              Catch.

                   Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal
                   canister with a screw-top.

                   The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT
                   SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia.
                   While not a physically threatening man, there is a
                   quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
                   intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility.
                   He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
                   carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably
                   one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as
                   radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came
                   true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his
                   friendliest face to Picard.

 SCRIMM                                      (pleasant)
                             Think you'll need that.

                   Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.

 SCRIMM                              It's no zone solution.
                                    (off his look)
                             You know. "No ozone."

                   He points to the sky.

 PICARD                              Oh...  yes... ultraviolet
                             protection. Thank you.
                             Mister...?

 SCRIMM                              Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant
                             Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of
                             the Resurrection Protective Force.
                                     (beat)
                             And you are?

 PICARD                              Jean-Luc Picard.

 SCRIMM                              Great name. French?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              You don't sound French.

                   Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never
                   leave Picard.

 PICARD                              I was raised in England and here
                             in the States. Thank you for
                             the... no zone.

                   Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any
                   citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him.

 SCRIMM                              Where in the States?

 PICARD                              Oh... here and there. You know
                             how it is.
 SCRIMM                              Not really. I was born and raised
                             right here. Never had much use
                             for travel.

                   He casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way.

 SCRIMM                              Where are you from most recently?

 PICARD                                      (thinking fast)
                             California. San Francisco.

 SCRIMM                              Beautiful city. Used to be,
                             anyway. I didn't think anyone
                             still lived there.

 PICARD                              There's a few of us left.

                   Picard steps around him and continues walking down the
                   street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him
                   again.

 SCRIMM                              That was a pretty clever trick you
                             did with the hospital's batteries.
                             How'd you do it?

 PICARD                              It wasn't a trick. I used to be
                             an electrical engineer.

 SCRIMM                              Huh.

                   He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but
                   a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard
                   realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.

 SCRIMM                              And what were you doing out at the
                             missile silo?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend of Cochrane's...
                             I wanted to see how he was doing.

 SCRIMM                              Lucky for him you came by when you
                             did. He might be dead now.

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              Maybe you can tell me what he's
                             been doing in that silo. We heard
                             some explosions out there this
                             morning...

 PICARD                              I think he was running a test on
                             an old rocket engine... and one of
                             the fuel cells burst.

                   Scrimm eyes him evenly.

 SCRIMM                              You seem to have an answer for
                             everything.

 PICARD                              Something wrong with that?

 SCRIMM                              Not yet.

                   A tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily.

 SCRIMM                                      (re: balm)
                             Be sure you put that on. You need
                             a lot of protection around here.

                   He holds Picard's eyes for a moment.

 PICARD                              Thank you. But I've never had
                             much trouble protecting myself.

                   Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm.
                   Picard walks around him and heads for the gates.
                   Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression --
                   clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...

 CUT TO: 
 83 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 83 
                   in orbit of Earth.

 84 INT. CORRIDOR 84 
                   Worf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so
                   men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim
                   looks on their faces. They are carrying new powerful-
                   looking phaser rifles and other equipment. The feeling
                   is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous
                   mission. They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a
                   DECKPLATE, exposing a large HATCH in the floor. Worf
                   hits his combadge.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're in
                             position.

 85 INT. BRIDGE 85 
                   Riker in command, Troi nearby. Riker is standing at
                   the security station looking at a monitor which
                   displays a schematic graphic of the ship. The position
                   of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are
                   on Deck 46.

 RIKER                              This is the Bridge. I'm releasing
                             the emergency force fields.

                   He nods to Troi, who works a console.

 86 INT. CORRIDOR 86 
                   Worf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting
                   the hatch flashes off. Worf reaches down and releases
                   the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh. He
                   glances at his men for a moment, then JUMPS down the
                   hatch...

 87 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 87 
                   As Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power
                   on this deck, hard to see. He looks around warily for
                   a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist
                   beacon. We immediately notice that we can see Worf's
                   breath -- it's freezing cold down here. He shines the
                   light around the darkened corridor, then silently
                   motions his arm for the others to follow. A beat, then
                   we see the security officers start to drop into the
                   corridor from the hatch above...

 88 NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR 88 
                   As Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at-
                   the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers.
                   We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
                   own light sources, intended to illuminate the target
                   before you shoot at it. The Security Officers are
                   constantly moving their lights back and forth through
                   the chilly air. Worf gives hand signals -- holds up
                   two fingers, then a fist, and points forward.

                   Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet,
                   stop, and take up firing positions... then two more
                   members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them
                   and take positions further down the corridor. Classic
                   military deployment. Worf starts scanning with a
                   tricorder.

 WORF                                      (hits combadge)
                             Worf to Bridge.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here.

 WORF                              There's a dampening field in place
                             on this deck. Our tricorders are
                             useless.

                   The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky,
                   eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They
                   open doors, check room by room, section by section,
                   still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold
                   darkness.

 90 ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD 90 
                   The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall,
                   ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative
                   Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry
                   and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of
                   the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing
                   through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off
                   an eerie glow.

                   We can also see that some of the machinery has been
                   altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly
                   arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --
                   there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,
                   equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has
                   gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward,
                   examines the corridor closely.

 ENSIGN HAWK                              What the hell is going on?

 WORF                              Borg...

                   Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin
                   picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's
                   not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully
                   as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and
                   machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some
                   circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team
                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
                   unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.

                   Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue
                   their search. They continue making their way down the
                   spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...

 92 NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR 92 
                   where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE
                   in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the
                   ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The
                   deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a
                   low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this
                   corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen
                   earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird
                   pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at
                   the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly
                   into the room, but clearly something is going on in
                   there.

                   Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up
                   positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on
                   Environmental Control.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're about to
                             enter the Environmental Control
                             Room.

                             themselves?

                   As Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign
                   Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation,
                   covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into
                   the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over
                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
                   Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where
                   the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,
                   throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of
                   darkness.

 WORF                                      (continuing)
                              Negative. However, they've
                              reconfigured the ODN network...
                              and re-routed all power on this
                              deck into Environmental Control.

                   As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time
                   when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something
                   MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes,
                   brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his
                   imagination?

                   A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing
                   happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can
                   only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping
                   out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the
                   Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that
                   something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT
                   around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of
                   circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast
                   we have trouble following it.

                   Worf turns his head at the sound.

 WORF                              Stand by, Commander
                                     (to team)
                             Where's Ensign Hawk?

                   Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there.
                   Everyone is alert, keyed up. The tension is thick.
                   Utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and
                   the frosty breathing of the team.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Worf? Is something wrong?

 WORF                              Something is very wrong,
                             Commander. We're falling back.

                   Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out. But
                   just as they start to fall back, everything happens at
                   once.

 93 BORG DRONES 93 
                   EXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS, CEILING AND FLOOR! What
                   follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and
                   furious we never get a true sense of what's happening.

                   A flurry of violence and motion and images:

                   -- A snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a
                      cybernetic nightmare.

                   -- Strange, bio-mechanical WEAPONS extruding from Borg
                      bodies, RIPPING into human flesh.

                   -- A crewmember PULLED into a bed of machinery.

 WORF                              Fire at will!

                   But the Borg are already on top of them. It's a brutal
                   fight in close quarters with no escape.

                   Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor,
                   bodies flying through the air... utter chaos and
                   terror. The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that
                   they don't have a chance...

 WORF                                      (throwing off a Borg)
                             Fall back!

                   The team starts backpedaling, FIRING as they go...but
                   the Borg are unstoppable now -- they put up personal
                   force fields to protect themselves.

 WORF                              Go, go, GO!

                   Worf pushes his men down the corridor. Everyone turns
                   and RUNS like hell. Worf bends down and grabs a
                   frightened Lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along.

 94 VARIOUS SHOTS: 94 
                   -- The team running through the corridors, SHOOTING
                      behind them at the pursuing Borg, to no effect...

                   -- Two of the Borg raise their arms and FIRE LASER
                      BURSTS out of their arms and wrists, taking DOWN two
                      Security Guards. Worf sees them fall but there's no
                      time to go back.

 95 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 95 
                   As Worf's team starts CLIMBING UP and out the dark
                   hatch in the floor seen earlier.
 96 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 96 
                   As the last member of Worf's team climbs out to safety.
                   The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf. He quickly
                   hits a few controls on his phaser, sets it to overload.
                   We hear the building WHINE. He JUMPS straight up into
                   the air, GRABBING onto the hatch rim, pulling himself
                   up. He barely manages to vanish from view just as the
                   phaser EXPLODES in a FIERY BLAST, taking out several of
                   the Borg drones.

 97 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 97 
                   The conclusive BLAST comes up through the hatch,
                   causing Worf to duck for a moment.

                   Worf reaches out to close the hatch, when a BORG HAND 
                   bursts up from below and GRABS his forearm. It's a 
                   test of strength. Worf reaches over with his other
                   arm, hits a control and the hatch SLIDES CLOSED,
                   SEVERING the Borg arm in a shower of sparks.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge -- force fields!

                   The force field FLASHES into place. Worf and his team
                   sit there a moment, catching their breath, stunned at
                   what they've just been through.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              What the hell happened down there,
                             Worf?

 WORF                              Commander... we have a problem.
                    OFF Worf's shaken expression...

 CUT TO: 
 98 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK - DAY 98 
                   Geordi and Picard are walking down the catwalk ladders
                   toward the missile's massive engines. Now that the
                   smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a
                   bit, we get our first good look at the ship and the
                   damage done in the Borg attack.

 GEORDI                                      (on the move)
                             Cochrane was going to use this
                             solid rocket booster to lift the
                             ship into orbit. Before the warp
                             drive took over... everything
                             would depend on these old chemical
                             engines.
                                     (beat)
                             Now here's the problem...

                   They arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
                   a large section of the engines have been BLASTED AWAY,
                   leaving a deep, ugly SCAR -- broken conduit lines,
                   wires that now lead to nothing. It's clear that a key
                   piece of equipment has been destroyed.

 GEORDI                                      (re: damage)
                             This used to be the throttle valve
                             assembly.
                                     (observing it)  
                             It controls the thrust of the
                             engines. It's been completely
                             vaporized... and without it,
                             there's no way to launch the ship.

 PICARD                              Can you reconstruct the throttle
                             valve?

 GEORDI                              Yeah... if I knew what it looked
                             like. There's probably five
                             hundred ways to design a valve
                             like this...

 PICARD                              We need to launch this ship in
                             under eighteen hours...
                                     (beat)
                             There must be some design
                             schematics... blueprints...

 GEORDI                              We're tearing this place apart
                             looking for them... but the
                             computers are down, and the fires
                             destroyed half the files...so
                             far, nothing.

                   They look at the damage in frustration.

 GEORDI                              If it was just part of the warp
                             drive, I'd know what to do. But
                             this... it's like trying to
                             rebuild Orville Wright's airplane
                             with canvass and sticks.

                   Picard thinks, remembers something.

 PICARD                              Wait a minute...

 99 INT. CONTROL ROOM 99 
                   Moments later. Picard and Geordi are looking at the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   warp ship with people working on it. Picard spreads
                   them out on the desk.

 GEORDI                              Yeah, I looked at these already.

                   Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is
                   walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking
                   most of it from view.

 GEORDI                              You can almost see the throttle
                             assembly in this one... but this
                             guy walked in front of it when
                             they took the picture.

                   Picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his
                   jacket pocket. He pulls out the canister of balm
                   Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table.

 PICARD                              Could you reconstruct the throttle
                             from a photograph like this... if
                             that man wasn't blocking the view?

                   Geordi thinks it over.

 GEORDI                              Maybe...
                                     (beat)
                             Sure. Yeah. As long as I could
                             get a clear look at the intake
                             configuration. But so far, we
                             haven't found any other photos.

 PICARD                                      (staring at photos)
                             If there are other photographs...
                             I think I may know how to find
                             them.

 CUT TO: 
 100 INT. BORG HIVE 100 
                   It's a while later, and the Borg are making progress.
                   Data is strapped to the table, PANELS open on his HEAD
                   and CHEST. Three Borg drones are working methodically
                   on his inner-circuitry. The jagged voice of the woman
                   cuts in:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Your resistance is... illogical.
                             To us, your neural net is simply
                             another piece of technology. We
                             will learn its secrets.

                   Data stares at the murky ceiling.

 DATA                              Who are you?

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the Borg.

 DATA                              That is a contradiction. The Borg
                             act as a collective consciousness.
                             There are no individuals.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the beginning... the end. I
                             am the one who is many. I am the
                             Borg.

                   Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS
                   the BORG QUEEN.

                   She is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen --
                   a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
                   of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED
                   by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face
                   and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty-
                   pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery
                   glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual
                   in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She
                   is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and
                   mechanical.

                   With the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself
                   down to where her face is very close to that of Data's.
                   Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint
                   in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness.

 DATA                              You are the guiding intelligence
                             behind the Borg...?

 BORG QUEEN                              Intelligence... ambition...
                             desire... I bring order to
                             chaos...

                   She studies his face with a certain child-like quality.

 BORG QUEEN                              It's unfortunate we will have to
                             destroy you to obtain the
                             information we need. You are a...
                             unique lifeform.
                                     (beat)
                             Synthetic... and yet far more than
                             a simple automaton.
                             You have no idea how close to
                             perfection you are.
                    She stares at him intently, and we get the hint that
                   her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation.
                   She seems fascinated by him. Data picks up on this.

 DATA                              How do you define perfection?

                   The Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating
                   herself.

 BORG QUEEN                              A blending of the organic and the
                             synthetic. The highest form of
                             life in the galaxy.

                   Data eyes her, considering.

 DATA                              An interesting definition. But it
                             is not one that applies to me. I
                             am completely artificial. I have
                             no organic components.

                   She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind.
                   She might've just found the chink in Data's armor.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever wondered what it's
                             like to have flesh?

 DATA                              It is impossible to imagine
                             sensations for which I have no
                             frame of reference.
                    She smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              That... can change.

                   The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them
                   a silent command. The drones immediately stop working
                   on Data's open panels... and shift their attention to
                   his right ARM. One of the drones tears off the sleeve
                   on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. Another then
                   uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic
                   skin from Data's arm. As Data prepares himself for the
                   worst...

 101 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 101 
                   THREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run
                   into view, hit a control panel on the wall. A giant
                   EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down, cutting off the
                   rest of the corridor.

                   The security guards turn to run down the hall, but then
                   there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal.
                   They drop to the deck and take combat stances.

 GUARD #1                              Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation!

                   They make adjustments to their weapons just as the
                   bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash. The
                   guards shield themselves against the fire and debris...
                   looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
                   shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed
                   bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. The
                   guards FIRE, and when they do the PHASER BLASTS
                   alternate color -- red, blue, green, purple, orange --
                   a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency.

                   The phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG... but
                   then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the
                   other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no
                   longer affect them.

 GUARD #1                              That's it, they've adjusted --
                             fall back!

                   They turn to run but BORG PHASER FIRE lances out from
                   the Borg soldiers and RIPS them apart.

 CUT TO: 
 102 INT. BRIDGE 102 
                   The mood is tense, grim. Riker, Worf and Troi are
                   gathered around a SCHEMATIC of the ENTERPRISE. The
                   lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by 
                   the color RED, representing the Borg advance through
                   the ship. A they watch, another section of
                   compartments and corridors suddenly turn RED.

                   Riker lets out a wary breath, starts pointing to
                   various points along the schematic.

 RIKER                              All right... we've lost control of
                             eight decks... three Cargo Bays...
                             one Shuttlebay.

 TROI                              Do we have any idea how many Borg
                             we're dealing with?

 WORF                              We saw at least thirty...and
                             there are twenty-two Enterprise
                             crewmembers reported missing...
                             including Commander Data.
 RIKER                              We'll have to assume they've been
                             assimilated into the Collective.

 TROI                              Even Data?

 WORF                              Data's positronic net contains
                             classified information on the
                             Enterprise. Command codes,
                             security protocols...

 RIKER                              If they control Data, they control
                             the ship.

                   A grim beat.

 RIKER                              We can't worry about that right
                             now. Let's concentrate on what we
                             can.

                   They stare at the schematic.

 WORF                              To control the Enterprise, they'll
                             have to gain access to one of two
                             locations. Main Engineering... or
                             the Bridge.

 RIKER                              We have to cover both
                             possibilities.
                                     (to Troi)
                             We'll take care of the Bridge.
                             Worf, take your men and seal off
                             Main Engineering. Turn it into a
                             fortress -- nothing gets in.

                   Worf nods and EXITS. As Riker and Troi exchange a
                   tense look...

 CUT TO: 
 103 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT 103 
                   The hospital is completely LIT UP -- the only building
                   in town with this much power.

 104 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 104 
                   Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked
                   "X-RAY PROCESSING." The RED LIGHT is on above the
                   door, but that means nothing to Picard... who opens the
                   door and steps inside...
 105 INT. X-RAY PROCESSING ROOM 105 
                   Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals
                   and washes, etc. But everything has a slightly
                   futuristic and cobbled-together feel. They are
                   developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine. The
                   room is lit with an AMBER glow. As soon as Picard
                   opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice:

 RUBY'S VOICE                              Shut that door!

                   Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around
                   the room. Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals,
                   turns around in fury.

 RUBY                              What are you, an idiot? Didn't
                             you see the red light was on?

 PICARD                              Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize
                             that --

 RUBY                              Thank God this plate was already
                             fixed.

                   She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a
                   window) out of a tub of water... holds it up to the
                   light. And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a man's
                   SKULL. Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                                      (re: X-ray)
                             Cochrane?

 RUBY                              Yes... and I only had enough
                             silver halide for one shot. So
                             you're lucky you didn't screw it
                             up.

 PICARD                              I'm very sorry.

                   She glances at him, sees he feels genuinely bad. She
                   softens a little.

 RUBY                              Don't worry about it.

                   She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
                   dry off the pane of glass.
 RUBY                              Did you need something?

 PICARD                              Yes... I wanted to ask you about
                             some photographs I saw out at the
                             silo. There were three of them...
                             printed on some kind of fabric.

 RUBY                              Bed sheets.
                                     (off his look)
                             I used my last set of bed sheets to
                             make those prints. Not the best
                             material, but I haven't seen a
                             clean piece of paper in five
                             years.

 PICARD                              Did you take any other pictures of
                             the rocket?

                   The X-ray is now dry, and Ruby turns and looks at him.

 RUBY                              Sure.
                                     (jokingly)
                             Why, did you want to buy them?

                   Picard doesn't realize she was kidding -- jumps on the
                   opportunity to get the photos.

 PICARD                              Yes. I don't have any money right
                             now, but I may be able to get
                             some.

                   Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious? She
                   gives him a curious smile.

 RUBY                              "Money." So you can get dome
                             money...

 PICARD                              I can try.
 RUBY                              You'd have to try real hard. No
                             one's used currency in over ten
                             years. What are you, from another
                             planet?
                    Picard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off.

 PICARD                              No... but sometimes I feel that
                             way.
                                     (beat)
                             What I meant was, I'd be willing
                             to trade for the photographs.

 RUBY                              Trade. Okay. The photographs...
                             for a straight answer.
                                     (beat)
                             Who are you? And how do you know
                             Zephram?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend... I met him
                             when he was doing his
                             undergraduate work at Cornell back
                             in --

 RUBY                                      (cuts him off)
                             'Fraid not.

                   Ruby walks past him with the X-ray...

 106 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 106 
                   Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor. She has a
                   satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one
                   over on this woman. And the truth is, she's enjoying
                   Picard's frustration. As they walk along...

 PICARD                              What?

 RUBY                                      (casual)
                             You're lying.

 PICARD                              What makes you say that?

 RUBY                              You're not someone who lies very
                             easily... so it's obvious when you
                             do... at least to me.

 PICARD                              Are you always sucha good judge
                             of character?

                   She stops, turns, looks at him.

 RUBY                              Always.

                   Ruby turns and walks off. Picard follows her, doggedly
                   determined to get those photos...

 107 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 107 
                   Beverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the
                   light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on.

 BEVERLY                              The occipital fracture is
                             widening... we're going to have
                             to fuse the bones...

 DOCTOR                              I'm a little worried about some of
                             these bone fragments. If they
                             move any closer to the brain, we
                             could be looking at a hemorrhage.

                   As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO
                   Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in
                   bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with
                   affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed,
                   watching her.

 PICARD                              Were the two of you... involved?

 RUBY                              No... not like you and Doctor
                             Crusher used to be.

 PICARD                                      (surprised)
                             How did you know about that?

                   Ruby looks at him with a smile.

 RUBY                              I didn't.

                   Her smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join
                   the Doctor and Beverly. Picard shakes his head and
                   smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same
                   time.

 RUBY                                      (to Doctor)
                             We can't take any more X-rays
                             until I can mix up a new batch of
                             the silver halide.

 DOCTOR                              Can you do it tonight? We may
                             have to operate.

 RUBY                              Sure. It'll be ready by morning.

                   Ruby turns and heads for the door. Picard moves after
                   her.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I need to talk to you
                             about those photographs. It's 
                             very important.

 RUBY                              I'm sure it is. But it'll have to
                             wait until tomorrow.

 PICARD                              It can't wait until tomorrow...

 RUBY                              Too bad.
                                     (beat)
                             Besides, it'll give you all night
                             to think up a new set of lies.

                   She flashes him that smile again, then darts out the
                   door. Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he
                   can't let it go at that...

 CUT TO: 
 108 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING 108 
                   Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing
                   for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty
                   phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking
                   weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons
                   aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security
                   Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons,
                   building makeshift barricades over each of the doors.

                   Worf is in command, directing the action.

 WORF                                      (to team)
                             Double check each assault
                             phaser... make certain that the
                             range setting is no more than
                             thirty meters. We don't want to
                             blast through the hull.

                   Worf turns and picks up his BAT'LETH SWORD off a nearby
                   console. He checks the sharpness of the blade.

 SECURITY OFFICER                              Are you sure you don't want
                             something a little more...
                             sophisticated, sir?

 WORF                              Mind your post, Lieutenant.

                   The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and
                   moves off. Worf makes a quick practiced motion with
                   the sword... decides he's ready.

 109 INT. BRIDGE 109 
                   Riker and Troi watching the schematic.

                   Riker works a control and the display ZOOMS IN to
                   display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting
                   Engineering and the surrounding deck. A SWARM of DOTS
                   representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering.

 RIKER                                      (to com)
                             Riker to Engineering. Mister
                             Worf...the Borg are approaching
                             your position.

 WORF'S COM VOICE                              Understood. We're ready.

                   Riker and Troi watch as the DOTS move closer...
                   closer...right up to the perimeter of Engineering.
                   The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks
                   like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants.

 110 INT. ENGINEERING 110 
                   As before. The security guards have taken positions
                   around the room, all weapons trained on the doors.

                   Worf is standing in front of the warp core, Bat'leth in-
                   hand.

 WORF                                      (calls out)
                             Charge weapons!

                   A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the
                   phaser weapons begin charging. It's tense -- everyone
                   standing ready with their weapons charging. This is
                   the moment of truth.

                   Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the
                   other. This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready
                   for battle.

 111 INT. BRIDGE 111 
                   Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of
                   the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now
                   completely surrounded Engineering on all sides,
                   including the deck directly above and below. In
                   essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the
                   rest of the ship.

 112 INT. ENGINEERING 112 
                   As before. Worf and the security team in their
                   positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they
                   start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere
                   behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering
                   through the walls and ceiling of an old house.

                   Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their
                   weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from
                   somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a
                   large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of
                   the room and travel to the other. There's an
                   overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
                   walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack
                   Starfleet troops.

 113 INT. BRIDGE 113 
                   Riker and Troi watching the display. The Borg dots
                   teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar.

 114 INT. ENGINEERING 114 
                   The clawing, skittering, clanging noises increase and
                   get louder...

                   ... we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at
                   any moment. Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth,
                   teeth bared. Unbearable tension and then...

                   The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually
                   disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is
                   even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the
                   room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest
                   sign of the Borg... but nothing happens.

 115 INT. BRIDGE 115 
                   Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots
                   begin moving away from Engineering. It looks like the
                   swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the
                   ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship.

 TROI                              They're bypassing Engineering...

 RIKER                              Where the hell are they going?

                   OFF the mystery...

 CUT TO: 
 116 INT. BORG HIVE 116 
                   CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE. His eyes are closed -- he is in
                   the android equivalent of sleep. CAMERA ROTATING and
                   PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping
                   sounds of VOICES from Data's past -- Picard, Riker,
                   Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own
                   voice... bits and pieces of his life...

                   The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for
                   humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling
                   him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of
                   dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more
                   human."

 BORG QUEEN'S VOICE                              Data...

                   Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK
                   revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg
                   operating table... his right arm and shoulder are
                   encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL,
                   obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell
                   into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the
                   tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the
                   room, carrying out various tasks.

                   There's been a change since we've been here last.
                   There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding
                   Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of
                   murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once
                   in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up
                   against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again.
                   We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're
                   definitely creepy.

                   Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do,
                   he's still immobilized.

                   Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward
                   the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It
                   stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to-
                   face with the Borg Queen again.

 BORG QUEEN                              You've taken your first step
                             toward perfection. How does it
                             feel?

 DATA                              I do not know what you are
                             referring to.

 BORG QUEEN                              That's because you haven't been
                             properly... stimulated yet.

                   A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by
                   the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down
                   slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data.
                   She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
                   Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and
                   moves away...

                   We can now see that all of the skin has been removed
                   from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of
                   his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on
                   the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
                   new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with
                   various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes
                   carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of
                   organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.

                   Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
                   puzzlement.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (re: flesh)
                             Do you know what this is, Data?

 DATA                              It would appear that you are
                             attempting to graft organic skin
                             onto my endo-skeletal structure.

 BORG QUEEN                              What a cold description... for
                             such a beautiful gift.

                   She smiles slightly, utterly confident. She leans her
                   face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm.

 117 EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATA'S ARM 117 
                   We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see
                   the individual hairs. The Borg Queen's LIPS move into
                   frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath. We
                   see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin, and the hairs stand
                   straight up in response.
 118 NEW ANGLE 118                    As Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in
                   surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before.
                   The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              Was that good for you?

                   Data can barely describe the sensation. But clearly,
                   it was pleasurable.

 DATA                              It was... interesting.

                   He looks at her.

 DATA                              Do it again... please.

                   As she smiles...

 CUT TO: 
 119 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 119 
                   A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the
                   most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No
                   yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other
                   structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very
                   solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over
                   from the inside.

                   Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are
                   sitting off the front porch.

                   After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft,
                   feeble light.

                   Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size
                   plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the 
                   equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's
                   a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind,
                   with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several
                   stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the
                   jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a 
                   moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath
                   and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back,
                   trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An
                   exhausting day.

 120 PICARD 120 
                   is watching her intently from afar. He's concealed
                   behind a supporting beam of one the town's many
                   WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view.

 121 RUBY 121 
                   pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over
                   shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt,
                   revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off
                   long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots...
                   undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off
                   her hips...

 122 PICARD 122 
                   is surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This
                   really isn't why he came out here.

 123 RUBY 123 
                   kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and
                   panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt...
                   pulls it off...

 124 PICARD 124 
                   doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...

 125 RUBY 125 
                   moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a
                   large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves
                   and helmet attached.

 126 PICARD 126 
                   is a little relieved... keeps watching...

 127 RUBY 127 
                   has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit...
                   pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to
                   an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD
                   SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal
                   pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
                   pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks
                   over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the
                   sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump...
                   makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then
                   turns the spigot...

                   After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come
                   out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the
                   helmet.

 128 PICARD 128 
                   watches, curious about what she's doing...

                   is now out of the bio-suit again... pulling on her
                   shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the
                   lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind
                   her. She begins walking toward the windmill.

 130 PICARD 130 
                   steps behind the girder, stays very still in the
                   shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill
                   without a glance and heads into town. After she's
                   gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches
                   her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...

 131 FRONT PORCH 131 
                   Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he
                   doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
                   RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.

 132 INT. RUBY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 132 
                   Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's
                   dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally
                   locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.

                   The house has only one room, which functions as a
                   living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also
                   Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,
                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
                   equipment all around. But the most striking feature of
                   the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed
                   PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are
                   hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-
                   air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of
                   furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced
                   Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --
                   bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of
                   carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,
                   taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace
                   quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a
                   feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.

                   Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to
                   photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
                   silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at
                   Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about
                   her...

                   She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
                   mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope
                   amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There
                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
                   a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.

                   At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.
                   It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
                   streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece
                   of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a
                   single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to
                   bloom.

                   Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then
                   pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a
                   box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see
                   PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a
                   younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way
                   it used to look... Ruby with a dog...

                   Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that
                   someone is watching him. He turns around to see...

 133 HIMSELF 133 
                   A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air
                   behind him.

                   Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the
                   street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a
                   telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks
                   focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of
                   the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by
                   the image. She's captured the essence of the man.

                   CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked.
                   Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's
                   there...

 134 RUBBY 134 
                   is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              You should pay closer attention to
                             those little red lights.

                   Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing
                   red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.

 RUBY                              You know, I'd be perfectly
                             justified in shooting you right
                             now.

                   Picard glances at the photograph of himself.

 PICARD                              I'd say you already have.

 RUBY                              Don't flatter yourself. I take
                             pictures of a lot of junk.

                   She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds
                   the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you
                             have a great explanation for why
                             those rocket photos are so
                             important you broke into my house.

 PICARD                              We're trying to repair Doctor
                             Cochrane's ship. It's been
                             damaged and --

 RUBY                              We?

 PICARD                              Myself... and a few other friends
                             of Zephram's.

 RUBY                              Friends from Cornell...

 PICARD                              Some.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's one. Keep going.

 PICARD                              A key piece of the ship has been
                             destroyed... and our only hope to
                             reconstruct it is if one of your
                             photographs shows us what it
                             looked like.

 RUBY                                      (considers)
                             All right. Truth. I believe that
                             one. Why is it so urgent you
                             couldn't wait until morning?

 PICARD                              We have to launch his ship by
                             tomorrow afternoon.

 RUBY                              Or...?

                   Picard has to come up with something -- decides to
                   throw her off with a high-tech explanation.

 PICARD                              Or the shielding around the
                             plutonium core will begin to
                             deteriorate. Within a day, the
                             entire silo will become so
                             radioactive that no one will be
                             able to come near it for a hundred
                             years.

                   Ruby eyes him evenly.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's two. One more, and
                             I pull the trigger.

                  Picard is starting to get angry.

 PICARD                              Why are you being so difficult?
                             All I'm asking for is to look at
                             one of the photographs. It'll
                             take five minutes.

 RUBY                              And all I'm asking for is the
                             truth. That would take five
                             minutes.
                                     (beat)
                             For all I know, you caused the
                             explosions at the silo... and now
                             you're trying to steal Zephram's
                             ship.

 PICARD                              I am not a thief...

                   Ruby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off
                   the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard.

 RUBY                              No, you're a petty burglar and a
                             liar...
                                     (beat)
                             You're no friend of Zephram's. He
                             is a great man. He's not like you
                             or me or any of the other zombies
                             walking around this town.

                   Picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality:

 PICARD                              No. He's a man with vision. He
                             can see beyond the problems that
                             surround us. He knows there's a
                             better future out there for
                             everyone... a future where crime,
                             poverty and war are things of the
                             past... a future where we reach
                             out and seek our destiny in the
                             stars.
                                    (beat)
                             I believe in that future, too,
                             Ruby. I believe in it in every
                             fiber of my being. And I'm
                             telling you... if we don't launch
                             that warp ship tomorrow, there's
                             a very good chance that future
                             will never happen.

                   She eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his
                   words have had any effect.

                   Ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her
                   gut...and finally hands him the photographs. Picard
                   glances through them -- his expression tells us the
                   photo he needs is in there.

 PICARD                              You won't regret this.

                   They share a look... and then Picard turns and walks
                   off into the night. Ruby watches him go... and we can
                   see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions.
                   Something about that man has touched her...

 135 NIGHT SCPOE POV 135 
                   A telescopic, green and white image of Picard walking
                   away from Ruby's home.

 136 LIEUTENANT SCRIMM 136 
                   is watching Picard through a set of night vision
                   binoculars, perched on the roof of a nearby building.
                   He frowns, wondering what Picard is up to...

 CUT TO: 
 137 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH 137 
                   The giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship --
                   a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for
                   communications and shielding. As we watch, FOUR
                   HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to
                   emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on
                   the hull. The Borg do not need pressure suits or
                   breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with
                   ease and onto the deflector dish...

 PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
 138 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN 138 
                   Where Riker, Troi, Worf and N.D.s are watching this
                   image on the Viewscreen.

 RIKER                              What are they doing?

 WORF                              They appear to be modifying the
                             deflector dish.

 TROI                              To do what? If they wanted a
                             weapon, they could've taken over
                             a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

 RIKER                              Deflector dish... why the
                             deflector dish...?

 WORF                              It doesn't make sense. The
                             deflector is only used for
                             shielding and long range
                             sensors...

                   Riker stares at the screen... notices something.

 RIKER                              Computer -- magnify grid twenty-
                             one alpha.

                   The image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific
                   point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of
                   two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish.
                   They appear top be modifying power conduits in some
                   fashion.

 WORF                              They're re-routing the deflector
                             power conduits...

 RIKER                              Computer -- thermal enhancement.

                   The image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what
                   they're doing. The power conduits are glowing bright
                   red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel
                   back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped
                   coil, which is pulsing.

 RIKER                              They're connecting the conduits to
                             subspace communications...

 WORF                                      (realizing)
                             They're converting the deflector
                             dish into an antennae...

 TROI                              They may be trying to send a
                             message to the other Borg...the
                             Borg in this time period...
 WORF                              What kind of message?

 RIKER                                      (thinking)
                             If it was me... I'd say "attack
                             Earth now... in the 21st
                             century... they'll be too strong
                             in the 24th."

                   They think about this for a moment as they watch the
                   Borg swarming on the deflector array.

 WORF                              We have to stop them from sending
                             that message.

 RIKER                              Agreed. Options?

 WORF                              Destroy the deflector dish.

 TROI                              Can we aim our dorsal phasers at
                             it?

                   Riker shakes his head.

 RIKER                              We've lost control of all weapons
                             systems... Transporters are
                             down... we can't get to a
                             Shuttlecraft... and it would take
                             us too long to fight our way down
                             to deflector control...

                   They think.

 WORF                              There is another way, Commander.
                             Do you remember your zero-G combat
                             training?

                   Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion.

 RIKER                              I remember it made me sick.

 TROI                                      (to Worf)
                             What are you suggesting?

 RIKER                              I think Mister Worf is suggesting
                             that we go outside for a little
                             stroll...

                   OFF their expressions...

 139 CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH 139 
                   Another one of Ruby's cloth-printed photos, this one a
                   clear view of the base of the missile engines --
                   Cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle.
                   Above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle-valve
                   assembly.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I'm almost afraid to say this,
                             Captain... but I think it's going
                             to work.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL we're in:

 140 INT. MISSILE SILO - LOWER CATWALK - DAY 140 
                   The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk.
                   Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of N.D.s attach
                   the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the
                   ship. The N.D.s are using high-tech welding tools and
                   sparks are flying. As they talk, they head back up the
                   catwalk toward the control room...

 PICARD                              Where's you get the alloy for the
                             throttle itself?

 GEORDI                              They used copper pipes in their
                             plumbing... so I melted it down...
                             and fused it with some tritanium
                             from one of our phaser casings.
                                     (beat)
                             It's not the strongest alloy...
                             but it's better than all this
                             crude aluminum and steel.

 141 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 141 
                   As Geordi and Picard ENTER. Lange is checking out a
                   launch console.

                   The room is now humming with power -- it's beginning to
                   look like the place is up and running. Picard stops
                   near the desk.

 PICARD                              Mister Lange -- have you brought
                             the computer systems back on-line
                             yet?

 LANGE                              Aye, Captain. This trinary
                             language is pretty archaic... but
                             I think I understand it now.

 PICARD                             Good.

                   As they speak, CAMERA MOVES in on the metal canister
                   of lotion Picard set on the desk earlier...

 142 EXT. MONTONA WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 142 
                   Scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a
                   cluster of military surveillance gear, listening to
                   Picard and Geordi's conversation. Far in the distance,
                   we can see the missile silo.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Are we on schedule? The Vulcan
                             ship will be here in less than two
                             hours.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              It'll be tight, but we should make
                             it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              What about our warp signature? It
                             has to be strong enough for them
                             to detect.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I've enhanced the plasma injectors --
                             don't worry, they'll see it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Well, with any luck... the Vulcans
                             will land outside Resurrection
                             tomorrow morning... and Earth will
                             never be the same again.
                    Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it
                   sounds like Picard is planning an invasion!

 143 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 143 
                   As before.

 PICARD                              All right. I'd better start
                             familiarizing myself with the
                             flight controls.

                   A console BUZZES. Lange moves to it, and activates a
                   small color video MONITOR. It shows an external view
                   of the MISSILE silo, just outside the hatch. Beverly
                   can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious
                   Zephram Cochrane.

 LANGE                              Doctor Crusher's at the access
                             hatch, Captain.

 PICARD                              Let her in.

                   Lange hits a couple of buttons...

 CUT TO: 
 144 CLOSE ON COCHRANE'S FACE 144 
                   A short time later. His head is bandaged, and he's
                   conscious, but frankly he looks like hell. He sits
                   back, looking a little overwhelmed.

 COCHRANE                              Let me get this straight... you're
                             from the future... I'm about to
                             change history... and all I have
                             to do is sit here and let you fly
                             my ship?

 145 WIDER 145 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around
                   Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a
                   corner of the Control Room.

 PICARD                              That's right.

                   He studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He
                   smiles a little ruefully.

 COCHRANE                              And people say I'm crazy...

                   Picard smiles.

 PICARD                              I assure you, Doctor, that after
                             today... no one will ever call you
                             that again.

                   Cochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell.

 COCHRANE                              Just do me a favor... bring my
                             ship back in one piece.

 PICARD                              That's a promise.

                   Picard turns and walks off with Beverly. Geordi moves
                   to Cochrane with a little bit of awe.

 GEORDI                              Doctor... my name is Geordi La
                             Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I
                             shake your hand?

                   Cochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They
                   shake hands.

 COCHRANE                              I wish I could go with you. Is
                             there anything I can do to help?

 GEORDI                              Not really... but I do have about
                             a thousand questions I've always
                             wanted to ask you.

 COCHRANE                              Since time is short... why don't
                             you pick the top ten and fire
                             away?

                   Geordi smiles...

 146 PICARD AND BEVERLY 146 
                   have moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks
                   exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops
                   down into a chair. Mid-conversation.

 PICARD                                       (surprised)
                             You actually performed surgery...?

 BEVERLY                              It was an experience. Metal
                             scalpels... needle and thread...

                   She looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of
                   the medkit -- a surgical transporter.

 BEVERLY                                      (re: device)
                             But I had a little help. Surgical
                             transporter. I used it to beam
                             out most of the bone fragments
                             from his brain.

 PICARD                              How did Doctor Almack react to
                             that?

 BEVERLY                              He was so confused by what I was
                             doing, I don't think he even
                             noticed.
                                     (beat)
                             Any word from the Enterprise?

 PICARD                              Not yet.

 BEVERLY                              You think they're still up there?

 PICARD                                      (wry)
                             If they're not... we'd better get
                             used to living in Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (light)
                             That might not be so bad... at
                             least for you.

                   She's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive.

 PICARD                              What's that supposed to mean?

                   There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's
                   attitude, she's simply making an observation about
                   someone she cares about.

 BEVERLY                              I saw the way you looker at her...
                             and I know that look.

                   Picard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's
                   a pointless conversation.

 PICARD                              Regardless of how I may feel about
                             Ruby... our fates lie along
                             different paths. Nothing can
                             change that.

 BEVERLY                              You want some advice? Don't do
                             this again.
                                     (off his look)
                             You know exactly what I mean.

 PICARD                              Beverly, there were many reasons
                             why you and I...

 BEVERLY                              I'd call them excuses. And the
                             first excuse on both our lists was
                             our "sense of duty." We convinced
                             ourselves that it was more
                             important than anything else. And
                             you know what? It's not.

                   She holds his look for a moment.

 PICARD                                      (neutral)
                             I have a ship to launch.

                   Picard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go...
                   wondering whether her words had any affect...

 147 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - DAY 147 
                   Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump. The
                   plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid --
                   silver halide. She caps the jug, picks it up, begins
                   walking up on the porch...then hesitates for a
                   moment... looks out over the horizon.

                   She hesitates... then frowns and goes inside...

                   Ruby comes inside, sets down the jug... begins to pick
                   up some more glass plates... stops... thinks... looks
                   up. Only a few feet away is the large picture of
                   Picard. She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want
                   to think about him... but there he is.

                   She glances back at the open door... struggles for a
                   moment... then makes a decision.

                   Despite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head.
                   With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and
                   heads for the door...

 149 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 149 
                   in Earth orbit.

 150 INT. BORG HIVE 150 
                   ANGLE ON CEILING as the Borg Queen descends from her
                   nesting place down towards the camera... ultimately
                   stopping just a few feet away. She speaks directly to
                   the camera.

 BORG QUEEN                              How do you feel?

 151 CLOSE ON DATA'S HAND 151 
                   His right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color,
                   fingernails, hair, sweat. It's completely human in
                   every way. His fingers move slightly, and then the
                   hand begins to rise. We follow his hand as it comes up
                   and touches his FACE, which is also FLESH. The gold
                   color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking.
                   Even his eyes are real now -- blue. He touches his
                   face tentatively, his expression confused... but
                   intrigued.

 DATA                              Different.
                    The Borg Queen descends closer. Data's arms are now
                   free, but he is still restrained on the table. The
                   rest of his body is still android, mechanical.

                   Data touches his two hands together, feeling the
                   sensations, flesh against machine. He touches his face
                   and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way.

 DATA                              My internal sensors tell me the
                             ambient temperature in the room is
                             ten point two degrees Celsius...
                                     (wondrous)
                             But my skin tells me it is cold.

                   As he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by
                   his own newfound senses.

 DATA                              My visual acuity has been reduced
                             by seventy-eight percent... and I
                             can no longer perceive light
                             beyond the ultraviolet or the
                             infrared...
                                     (beat)
                             But I can see.

                   It's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling
                   and emotion like he's never had before. The Borg Queen
                   watches, pleased. She hovers close to him.

 BORG QUEEN                              Until today... your emotions were
                             trapped inside an artificial
                             shell. You didn't know what it
                             was to truly feel.
                                     (beat)
                             And there's so much more for you
                             to experience.  I will guide you
                             into a world of sensation unlike
                             anything you can imagine.
                                     (beat)
                             All you have to do... is give us
                             access to your neural net.

                   Data looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality.

 DATA                              No. I will not betray my friends.

 BORG QUEEN                              They're not your friends...
                             they've held you back... kept you
                             from your destiny...

 DATA                              That is not true. They have tried
                             to help me.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have they given you what I have
                             given you? Did they even try?

 DATA                              I... do not want this...

                   But his words have a certain hollow quality to them.
                   He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the
                   Borg Queen notes this immediately. She reaches out
                   with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek.

 BORG QUEEN                              You're becoming more human all the 
                             time, Data. Now you're learning 
                             how to lie.

 DATA                              I wish to... go back to the way I
                             was.

 BORG QUEEN                              More lies.

                   She SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the
                   pain, the shock. A small trickle of blood comes from
                   his mouth. He looks at her in surprise, but before he
                   can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on
                   the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and
                   erotic moment. She pulls back. Data reels, trying to
                   sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain.
                   Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer
                   to him, face-to-face... seductive... beguiling.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever know a woman? Do
                             you know what it's like to feel
                             her breath on your face... her
                             skin against yours... flesh
                             against flesh?

 DATA                              My creator did not intend for me
                             to experience these things.

 BORG QUEEN                              I'm your creator now.

                   She rubs her body against his, cat-like... then pulls
                   him to her and kisses him deeply. Off the image of
                   their bizarre embrace...

 CUT TO: 
 152 INT. BRIDGE 152 
                   Riker, Worf, and three Security N.D.s are pulling on
                   SPACESUITS. The suits are form-fitting, sleek, no
                   bulky oxygen tanks. The helmets are the same -- they
                   conform to the contours of the skull and face.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             You will have to realign the
                             targeting array of the quantum
                             torpedo... and reprogram the
                             warhead for the localized
                             detonation.
                                     (beat)
                             There's only one torpedo left...
 RIKER                              I guess I'd better get it right
                             the first time.

 WORF                                      (to all)
                             The Borg will undoubtedly attack.
                             Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation.

                   The Security Officers check their phasers and wait as
                   Riker and Worf finish putting on their suits. Riker
                   straps a tool case to his suit.

 RIKER                              Ready?

                   Everyone nods. Riker goes to a wall panel and
                   activates the control. The Airlock door seen earlier
                   OPENS. Riker turns back to Troi.

 TROI                              Good luck.

                   Riker nods. Then he, Worf, and the Guards ENTER the
                   airlock and Troi close the door behind them.

 153 INT. AIRLOCK 153 
                   A tiny room separating the Bridge from the outer hull.

 RIKER                              Depressurize.

                   Worf hits a control and the room DEPRESSURIZES with a
 HISSING SOUND. 
 WORF                                      (to others)
                             Activate magnetic constrictors.

                   They all activate controls on their wrists and there is
                   a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized.

                   Riker hits another control and the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR
                   SLIDES OPEN, revealing the vast vacuum of SPACE. They
                   begin to walk out of the airlock...

 154 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK 154 
                   As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
                   top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as
                   the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready,
                   marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The
                   scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which
                   hangs above the ship.

             155   ON RIKER & WORF                                            155

                   As they approach the edge. Worf gives a hand signal
                   and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical
                   deployment and drops down onto their bellies. They
                   crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause.
                   Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             Are you alright? 

 RIKER                              Just a little queasy...

 WORF                              Try not to look at the stars...
                             keep your eyes on the ship.

 RIKER                              Right.

 WORF                              And Commander, whatever you do...
                             do not vomit in your exo-suit. It
                             would be... unpleasant.

 RIKER                              I'll keep that in mind.

                   Riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself.

 RIKER                                      (to all)
                             Over and under!

                   They all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the
                   underside of the saucer.

                   The CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they
                   traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're
                   upside down relative to their previous position, but
                   there's no up or down in space and their magnetized
                   suits hold them to the hull.

                   It's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to
                   their new position. From this angle, the Enterprise
                   appears to be upside down!
                    Once they're on the underside of the saucer, they can
                   see the rest of the ship laid out above them.

 156 NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV 156 
                   The deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered
                   with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify
                   it. Some of them turn and see us.

 157 RIKER AND WORF 157 
                   Begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer.
                   (Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the
                   hull at all times.) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past
                   them as the Borg open fire.

 158 THE BORG 158 
                   A DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin
                   skittering down (which is normally up) the
                   interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes
                   like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight.

 159 A SECURITY GUARD 159 
                   Is HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space.

 160 THE TORPEDO TUBE 160 
                   Riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends
                   down and opens the hatch. Borg phaser shots hitting
                   all around him. The open hatch cover provides some
                   protection from the Borg fire.

 RIKER                              Worf! I'm going to need at least
                             five minutes!

 WORF                              Understood!

                   Worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin
                   exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg.

                   They pick off a few Borg, who also go FLYING into
                   space. As Riker begins to work...

                   headsets. Picard exchanges a look with Geordi.

 PICARD                              Ready to make a little history?

 GEORDI                              Always am.

 164 INT. CONTROL ROOM 164 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s watching the countdown.
                   Suddenly a console BUZZES. Lange goes to the monitor
                   seen earlier, hits a switch -- the monitor comes alive,
                   shows that Ruby is now standing outside at the hatch.
                   Lange reacts in surprise.

                   Picard and Geordi working the controls, watching the
                   readings, etc. We hear Lange's com voice:

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              Phoenix, we have a problem out
                             here. There's a woman at the

                             Ruby Sloan and she wants to see
                             the Captain.

                   Picard and Geordi react -- her timing is pretty bad.

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              What do you want me to do, sir?

 GEORDI                              We can't let her in... she'll see
                             Cochrane isn't making the flight.

 PICARD                              We can't leave her out there.
                             When the ship launches... she'll
                             be killed.

 GEORDI                              Tell her to go back to
                             Resurrection.

                   Ruby standing by the hatch, trying to look calm...
                   Scrimm and three Militia Soldiers holding her at
                   gunpoint. The hatch hisses and POPS OPEN. Scrimm
                   shoves a gun into Ruby's side -- get going. As they
                   start to crawl inside...

 167 INT. CONTROL ROOM 167 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have focused their attention
                   on the countdown. Ruby climbs down the ladder, a tense
                   look on her face.

 LANGE                              Ms. Sloane, if you'll have a seat,
                             I'll let you talk to --

                   Suddenly, the three heavily-armed militia soldiers jump
                   down the ladder from the hatch. One of the Starfleet
                   N.D.s goes for a phaser, and a soldier BLASTS him
                   backward with a spray of bullets from his automatic
                   weapon. Everyone else freezes. A tense beat, then
                   Scrimm climbs down the ladder and looks around the
                   room...

 CUT TO: 
 168 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - BATTLE ON THE HULL 168 
                   Riker in the torpedo tube, frantically working. He
                   begins to physically MOVE the torpedo tube itself like
                   he's moving the barrel of a huge cannon... as he
                   struggles to aim it toward the huge deflector dish...

 169 WORF AND THE SECURITY GUARDS 169 
                   are about fifty feet away from Riker. From their prone
                   positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, BLASTING
                   them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover
                   behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of
                   the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of
                   metal to get to them, making then easy targets.

                   Suddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector
                   dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES
                   directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the
                   dish and flying through the vacuum of space like
                   paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too
                   many targets to defend from above and below. One of
                   the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a
                   vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES
                   the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing
                   the man instantly. Worf FIRES  a phaser blast into the
                   Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space.

                   Worf turns to Riker.

 WORF                              Commander, you're five minutes are
                             up!

 170 RIKER 170 
                   swings the torpedo tube into place, aiming it at the
                   deflector dish. He hits a control on the side of the
                   tube... and a QUANTUM TORPEDO automatically slides up
                   from below and LOCKS INTO position in the tube, like a
                   panel on the torpedo and begins working on the
                   circuitry.

 SERGEANT                              No good, sir. They're on internal

 SERGEANT                              And those doors were made to
                             withstand a nuclear attack.

                   Scrimm looks frustrated for a moment...then turns his
                   attention to Ruby.

 GEORDI                              One minute to launch.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Mister Picard... this is
                             Lieutenant Scrimm. I'm going to
                             have to insist that you shut down
                             the launch. You see, I know what
                             you're doing... and I'm not going
                             to just stand by and let it
                             happen.

                             who'll be first.

                   As Picard reacts in shock...

 INTERCUT: 
 175 INT. CONTROL ROOM 175 
                   Scrimm is now holding Ruby by the arm. He shoves the
                   com headset to her mouth.

 SCRIMM                              Say hello...

                   Ruby is scared, but trying to keep it together.

                             Launch the ship.

                   Picard reacts to her voice, but keeps working the
                   controls, trying to concentrate. Scrimm draws his gun.

 SCRIMM                              Go ahead -- launch it. Ruby will
                             be here when you get back... but
                             she won't have a whole lot to say.

 176 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 176 
                   Geordi and Picard exchange a tense look. Picard
                   struggles. It's a difficult moment -- what does he do?
                   The countdown clock is approaching 15 seconds...14...
 13... 
                   Everything hangs in the balance -- Ruby's life, the
                   future of the Earth, Picard's feelings, his duty...

                   Finally, Picard reaches out hits a control -- the
                   countdown clock stops at 11 seconds.

 GEORDI                              Captain --

                             This is Picard. I've suspended
                             the launch sequence.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Thanks. Now, why don't you join
                             us and we'll have a little talk?

                   Picard unstraps himself and takes off the headset.

 GEORDI                              Captain... we've got less than ten
                             minutes before that Vulcan ship
                             leaves the system. We've got to
                             go now.

 PICARD                              It'll have to wait. Come on.

                   Geordi quickly starts unstrapping himself...

 177 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK 177 
                   Picard and Geordi stop outside the massive blast doors,
                   which are separating them from the control room.

 PICARD                              Geordi, can you see into the room?

                   Geordi looks at the blast doors... and he does so, the
                   electronic PUPILS in his eyes rotate, change shape and
                   color.

 178 GEORDI'S POV 178 
                   A high-tech INFRARED VIEW of the door, but we can't see

 GEORDI                              No... the door's too thick.

 PICARD                                      (frustrated)
                             Then we'll just have to assume
                             it's still there...

 GEORDI                              What's still there?

 PICARD                              Get a tricorder. You're going to
                             have to track my exact position in
                             that room...

                   mechanism. She glances up -- there's a BORG flying
                   through space directly at him! Riker tries to bring up
                   his phaser, but it's too late. The Borg SLAMS into
                   him.

                   Riker makes a desperate grab for the torpedo tube itself,
                   trying to hold on, but the momentum of the Borg impact
                   is too great -- they both tumble off into space together,

                   channel...

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Aliens... that's what I thought.
                             From where... Canada?

                   The tricorder BEEPS and he smiles...

 192 INT. CONTROL ROOM 192 
                   As before.

 PICARD                              From another planet.
                                     (beat)
                             Oh, I almost forgot... they
                             have green blood and pointed ears.

 SCRIMM                                      (skeptical)
                             And you know all this... because
                             you're a space-man too...

 PICARD                              I'm afraid you've caught me. I am
                             a space-man.

                   Scrimm smirks at him -- what gall this guy has. But
                   Ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in Picard's
                   words. She frowns in puzzlement.

 RUBY                                      (quiet)
                             Truth... he's telling the truth...

                   Picard looks at Ruby, and at that moment something on
                   a console behind her catches his eye: a LIGHT on
                   Beverly's SURGICAL TRANSPORTER is now FLASHING. No one
                   else notices.

 SCRIMM                              You're an entertaining man, Mister
                             Picard. But you're also full of
                             shit.

                   Scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding
                   to Ruby's head. The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop Scrimm.

 PICARD                              Now, Geordi!

                   -- The gun in Scrimm's hand DEMATERIALIZES. Scrimm
                   reacts in shock.

                   -- Instantly, the gun REMATERIALIZES in Picard's
                   outstretched hand. He quickly pushes the barrel to
                   Scrimm's forehead.

 PICARD                              Actually, you're full of shit.

                   Everyone is in the room stunned by what's happened.
                   Picard takes charge before anyone can recover.

 PICARD                                      (continuing)
                             Now, tell your men to drop their
                             weapons.

                   There's a beat, but then Scrimm sees he has little
                   choice.

 SCRIMM                              Weapons... down.

                   The other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which
                   are quickly picked up by Beverly and a Starfleet N.D.
                   Picard hands his gun to Lange, who covers Scrimm with
                   it.

                   Ruby turns to Picard.

 PICARD                              Are you all --

                   Ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close.
                   He hugs her back, grateful she's alive. Ruby pulls
                   away.

 RUBY                              I think you have a plane to catch.

                   Picard smiles and heads back toward the Phoenix...

                   Riker slams into the hull and the BEAM goes OFF. He
                   gets his bearings quickly and then RUNS toward the
                   torpedo tube where Worf and his few remaining men are
                   still fighting the Borg, who are about to overrun their

                   reaches the torpedo tube, pulls up the firing control
                   mechanism, which shows a monitor screen with a cross-
                   hair targeting display. He activates the monitor,
                   which begins tracking over toward the deflector dish.

                   clamps a conduit into a power junction... then grabs
                   hold of a rotating lever inside the tube and TURNS it.
                   He ducks out of the way as the torpedo is LAUNCHED with
                   a ROAR.

                   As the torpedo streaks out from the saucer section and

                   Troi and the other N.D.s react with relief. The

 205 EXT. MONTANA - MISSILE SILO - WIDE SHOT - DAY 205 
                   as the concrete missile doors slide open and the
                   Phoenix is LAUNCHED up into the sky, riding a pillar of
                   fire and smoke. This is our first real look at the
                   ship and it resembles an oversized ICBM with a
                   specialized cockpit on top.

 206 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 206 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have the militia soldiers

                   Picard and Geordi working the controls as the ship

                   The g-forces push them back into their seats.

 GEORDI                              Ignore it. We'll be fine.

                   The rocket booster SHUTS DOWN as the ship leaves
                   Earth's orbit and coasts on its momentum. After a
                   beat, the first stage booster separates from the ship
                   and DROPS AWAY, leaving three-quarters of the ship in
                   space.

 211 INT. BORG HIVE 211 
                   CLOSE ON DATA, head tilted back, eyes closed,
                   smiling...a few droplets of WATER fall from above onto
                   his face. He smiles wider, reveling in the sensation.

 212 WIDER 212 
                   Data is still restrained on the table, but a conduit
                   has been placed above his head and is dripping
                   condensation onto his face. Data is now a completely
                   new being. His entire BODY is now made of HUMAN FLESH.
                   It's a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered
                   what Data would look like human, we're now getting our
                   first look.

 213 THE BORG QUEEN 213 
                   DESCENDS from her nest in the ceiling. She watches
                   Data for a moment... rubs the moisture into his face.

 BORG QUEEN                              A Borg in all but name.

                   Data, although clearly enraptured with his new
                   sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain
                   his own sense of identity.

 DATA                                      (weak)
                             I am... grateful for what you have
                             given me. But I still do not wish
                             to be assimilated.

 BORG QUEEN                              A universe of sensation is waiting
                             for you... don't you want to
                             explore it... with me?

                   To his surprise, Data finds that he is becoming drawn
                   to this strange creature and all that she can offer
                   him.

 DATA                              Yes...

 BORG QUEEN                              Then take the final step... give
                             me the Enterprise... and we can be
                             together... always.

                   He struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer.

 DATA                              No... I cannot.

                   Without taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out
                   a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. The
                   color of Data's FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY --  as though
                   the blood has drained from his skin. Another droplet
                   of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this
                   time his eyes widen in shock.

                   The sensation of human feeling is gone.

 BORG QUEEN                              I've deactivated the sensory
                             inputs. That flesh on your body
                             is just meat, now.

 DATA                              No... no, please... you cannot...

                   She moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her
                   voice:

 BORG QUEEN                              You must give me what I want...
                             now. Without the deflector dish,
                             we can no longer send for an early
                             invasion. We must assimilate
                             Earth ourselves. I need this
                             ship.

                   She hits the control, and the COLOR returns to his
                   face. Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again.
                   The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her
                   attitude seductive and affectionate once again.

 BORG QUEEN                              Isn't it better like this...?

 DATA                              Yes... but the Enterprise... my
                             duty...

 BORG QUEEN                              ... is to yourself. Don't make me
                             hurt you again...

                   She touches the control again. Data is shocked back
                   into his cold, android self. He's like a heroin addict
                   being denied his "high" with the flick of a switch.

 DATA                              No... no, it's so... empty...
                             please... give it back... I need
                             it...

 BORG QUEEN                              And I need to control this ship.
                             Let me into your mind.

                   Data struggles, anguished... we've never seen him like
                   this before... completely beaten down... finally, he
                   nods. The Borg Queen touches the control again. A
                   sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data.
                   And the Queen kisses him on the mouth.

                   This time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into
                   the emotion of the moment. She pulls back a little,
                   looks at him softly, passionately. Data stares back at
                   her, breathless -- he seems to be completely in her
                   thrall.

 DATA                              In order to access my neural
                             net... you will need to create a
                             positronic interface.
                                     (beat)
                             I will tell you how.

                   OFF the Borg Queen's smile of victory...

 CUT TO: 
 214 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 214 
                   As before. Picard and Geordi work the control in
                   silence for a few moments. The ship is floating in
                   space, now a good distance from Earth.

 GEORDI                              Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

 PICARD                              As they used to say... all systems
                             are go.

                   Geordi works his console...

 215 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 215 
                   Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the
                   ship on either side of the Phoenix, revealing primitive
                   WARP NACELLES tucked inside the craft. The warp
                   nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward
                   on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles
                   should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a STAR
                   TREK starship.

                   This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural
                   design element of our ships.

 216 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 216 
                   As before.

 GEORDI                              The Vulcans should be out there
                             right now. We need to break the
                             warp barrier in the next five
                             minutes if we're going to get
                             their attention.

 PICARD                              Bring the warp core on-line. I'll
                             lay in a heading.

 GEORDI                              The nacelles are charged...
                             nuclear warhead standing by.
                             We're ready to ignite the warp
                             drive.

 PICARD                              Engage.

 217 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 217 
                   The warp nacelles FLARE with power and the ship begins
                   moving forward in space.

 218 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 218 
                   They're SLAMMED BACK into their seats from the massive
                   G-forces.

 GEORDI                              Warp field looks good...
                             structural integrity holding...

                   Picard activates a monitor which begins showing a 
                   digital display of their speed.

 PICARD                                      (off monitor)
                             Speed... twenty thousand
                             kilometers per second.

 219 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 219 
                   The ship is going faster... faster...

 220 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 220 
                   Troi is standing outside the emergency airlock with the
                   Ensign, who is working the wall panel.

                   The airlock door OPENS after a beat, and Riker, Worf
                   and One Security Guard ENTER. They're exhausted after
                   the pitched battle. Troi smiles at them as they remove
                   their helmets.

 TROI                              I have to admit there was a moment
                             there when --

 RIKER                                      (holds up a hand)
                             Hold that thought.

                   He turns away and then doubles over behind a console
                   and begins vomiting off screen. Worf shrugs.

 WORF                              Strong heart. Weak stomach.

                   A light beat, and then suddenly the entire Bridge GOES
                   DARK -- ALL POWER GONE. Console, monitors, everything.

 RIKER                              Report!

 WORF                              We've lost Bridge control!
 RIKER                              Emergency override!

 WORF                                      (works)
                             Nothing.

 221 INT. BORG HIVE 221 
                   The Borg Queen is floating in the middle of the room,
                   surrounded by Borg consoles and technology. Data is
                   still on the table, with some kind of specialized
                   conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors,
                   which are inactive at the moment. He appears to be
                   caught up in the rapture of his new sensations, and his
                   personal connection to the Borg Queen. All thought of
                   his Starfleet responsibilities are gone.

 DATA                                      (to Queen)
                             I am re-routing Bridge command
                             functions to this location.

                   Data thinks for a moment, and the monitors suddenly
                   COME TO LIFE and the equipment around the Queen HUMS
                   with POWER.

                   Information about critical Enterprise systems flows
                   across the monitor screens -- we might recognize
                   graphics from the Bridge displays. The Borg are now in
                   control.

 BORG QUEEN                              Eliminate their remaining
                             defenses. I will send Borg to
                             assimilate the rest of the crew.

                   Data nods... but then one of the consoles BEEPS.

 DATA                                      (reacts)
                             There is a perimeter alert. A
                             ship has entered sensor range.
 BORG QUEEN                              Vulcan?

 DATA                              No.

                   Data tilts his head and --

 222 A MONITOR 222 
                   shows an exterior space shot. The image rapidly ZOOMS
                   IN on the distant PHOENIX. The ship is racing through
                   space.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (reacts, to Data)
                             Give me helm control.

                   Data nods. Another console lights up. She moves to
                   work it herself...

 223 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 223 
                   As the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse
                   speed.

 224 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 224 
                   As before, Picard is now steering the ship with a 21st
                   century JOYSTICK CONTROL. The ship is moving faster
                   and faster, trembling now, a ROAR building.

 PICARD                              Passing one-half light speed. The
                             starboard nacelle's running a
                             little hot...

 GEORDI                              I'm on it...

                   The CABIN shakes a little.

 GEORDI                              The inertial dampers are having
                             trouble compensating... I don't
                             think Cochrane built this thing
                             for comfort.

 PICARD                              Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five
                             thousand kilometers per second.

                   WHOOSH! A weird DISTORTION passes through the cabin
                   like a wave, then vanishes.

 GEORDI                              There's no temporal shielding in
                             here! We're starting to pick up
                             relativistic effects!

 PICARD                              One minute to warp threshold...

 225 EXT. SPACE 225 
                   The warp ship WHIPS by... and then a moment later, the
                   ENTERPRISE ROARS into view, chasing the tiny ship.

 226 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 226 
                   Geordi glances out the window... does a double-take and
                   looks back up in surprise...

 GEORDI                              Captain, the Enterprise!

 PICARD                                      (taps combadge)
                             Picard to Enterprise.
                                     (beat)
                             Picard to Enterprise -- do you
                             read me?

                   No response.

 PICARD                              Their com system must still be
                             down.

 GEORDI                              Well, I feel a whole lot better
                             with them out there. We may need
                             some help.

 227 INT. BORG HIVE 227 
                   As before, the Queen floating above the helm control
                   console. The warp ship is on the monitor, getting
                   closer.

 DATA                              I have repaired the weapons array.
                             Phasers are on-line.

                   A floating CROSSHAIR appears on the monitor showing the
                   warp ship. The Queen works the console. The crosshair
                   moves, but refuses to lock onto the warp ship. She
                   frowns.

 BORG QUEEN                              The targeting lock isn't working.

                   Data looks puzzled.

 DATA                              I do not understand. The optical
                             data network has been repaired,
                             and all systems are functioning.

                   The Queen works furiously, still can't get the
                   crosshairs to lock onto the ship.

 BORG QUEEN                              Your diagnostics are in error. I
                             need weapons.

 DATA                                      (thinks)
                             The problem must lie in the
                             interface between Starfleet and
                             Borg technology. Your console may
                             not be configured to handle the
                             data flow.
 BORG QUEEN                              Can you configure it?

 DATA                              I believe so.

 BORG QUEEN                              Do it.

                   She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby
                   console... and the restraints holding Data to the table
                   are RELEASED. Two Borg drones move to him... as he
                   stands up and heads for the Queen, the specialized
                   cable still attached to his head...

 228 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 228 
                   closing in on the tiny warp ship. It's like a shark
                   chasing a guppy.

 229 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 229 
                   Ship SHAKING with power and acceleration.

 PICARD                              Approaching light speed...

                   Geordi glances out a side window.

 GEORDI                              They're getting awfully close...
                             what the hell are they doing?
 PICARD                              We're crossing the threshold!

                   The ship is really SHAKING HARD now -- and the
                   compartment is DISTORTING slightly, stretching,
                   everything becoming elongated...

 230 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 230 
                   The ship is STRETCHING in the familiar "rubber band
                   effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but
                   this effect is much slower. It's on the verge of
                   hitting warp speed. The Enterprise still on their
                   tail.

 231 INT. BORG HIVE 231 
                   Data is standing right next to the Queen, and is
                   studying the Borg console intently. Two Borg drones
                   stand nearby, watching closely.

 DATA                              I believe I see the problem.

                   In the blink of an eye:

 -- DATA WHIRLS AROUND AND SLAMS AN ARM INTO ONE OF THE                    BORG DRONES. The drone is knocked off its feet.

                   -- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at
                   Data's head. This is the same Borg with the deadly
                   stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier. The spikes
                   TEAR into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing BLOOD.

                   -- Data reacts in pain. He GRABS the Borg's arm and
                   with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the
                   same time. The Borg FLIES BACKWARD, causing the
                   cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of
                   sparks.

                   -- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill.
                   But Data's too quick for her. With one swift motion,
                   he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across
                   the room.

 232 NEW ANGLE 232 
                   As the spikes on the severed Borg arm PUNCTURE one of
                   the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier. A HUGE
                   EXPLOSION of DEADLY GAS bursts out of the ruptured
                   tank. The WALL of roiling gas sweeps through the
                   entire Borg Hive.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (screams)
                             No!

                   She lunges at Data just as the gas envelopes them!

 233 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 233 
                   As it GOES INTO WARP -- it shoots forward and streaks
                   away from the Enterprise!

 234 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 234 
                   As Picard and Geordi are slammed back into their seats
                   and the stars WHIP PAST the windows in the familiar
                   warp effect.

 235 INT. BORG HIVE 235 
                   Data and the Borg Queen tearing and clawing at each 
                   other amongst the spewing gas. The Borg drones try to
                   get away, but they are SWALLOWED by the rush of gas,
                   fall to the deck, twitching in pain.

                   Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck,
                   grappling with each other.

 236 EXT. SPACE - THE WARP SHIP 236 
                   As it STREAKS PAST -- the warp ship flying at top
                   speed.

 237 INT. BORG HIVE 237 
                   Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each
                   other... the gas swirling around their bodies... and as
                   it does, we see the FLESH on their bodies start to
                   LIQUEFY and MELT AWAY in a horrific ooze of blood and
                   skin.

 238 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 238 
                   As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably,
                   Warp stars streaking by.

 PICARD                              Bring us about...

                   A beat as Geordi works.

 GEORDI                              Dropping out of warp.

                   Out the front windows, the warp stars STOP... the ship
                   JOLTS slightly... turns to the left... Earth can be
                   seen in the distance.

                   They smile. It's a moment of victory.

 PICARD                              Let's begin the landing procedure.

 239 INT. CARGO BAY/BORG HIVE 239 
                   The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every
                   surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of
                   Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg
                   drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic
                   matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies,
                   leaving only raw mechanical skeletons.

 MOVE TO REVEAL: 
 240 DATA AND THE BORG QUEEN 240 
                   lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a
                   shocking image: all of his human flesh has been
                   STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His
                   metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes
                   are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but
                   the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is
                   stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with
                   no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him
                   before -- raw and mechanistic.

                   Data rolls over... still locked around him is the
                   MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic
                   spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading
                   off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the
                   very top of the spine.

                   Data throws off the grotesque form. The Borg Queen
                   carcass writhes and claws at the air. She speaks in a
                   flat, mechanical voice.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (fritzed)
                             Data...

                   Data reaches out with one hand... grabs the metal
                   spinal column just below the brain stem... and SNAPS IT
                   IN TWO. The blinking brain stem FRITZES OUT.

 241 INT. CORRIDOR 241 
                   Two Borg Drones moving down the hall suddenly stop...
                   twitch... the blinkies on their bodies GO OUT... and
                   they both FALL OVER DEAD. Their connection to their
                   Queen severed.

 242 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE 242 
                   Another Borg Drone reacts... lights out... slumps over
 DEAD. 
 243 INT. BORG HIVE 243 
                   Data releases the remains of the dead Borg Queen. He
                   leans back a little, as though exhausted by his
                   remarkable experience. CAMERA PULLS BACK, emphasizing
                   the loneliness of this smoking, scorched android
                   sitting alone in the ruins of the Borg Hive...

 CUT TO: 
 244 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 244 
                   The missile doors now open, the ground badly scorched
                   from the launch. Scrimm and his militia guards are
                   sitting on the ground, while Lange and the other
                   Starfleet N.D. keep a watchful eye on them. Cochrane
                   is sitting against a rock, while Beverly checks him
                   over. Ruby is pacing, lost in thought...

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Isn't anyone going to say welcome
                             back?

                   Everyone looks up to see --

 245 PICARD AND GEORDI 245 
                   standing a few feet away, tired but triumphant.

 BEVERLY                              Did it work?

                   Picard nods. Beverly, Lange and the N.D. look
                   relieved. Ruby takes a few steps toward Picard.

 246 COCHRANE 246 
                   smiles up at Geordi.

 COCHRANE                              Mister La Forge... now I'd like to
                             shake your hand.

                   Geordi smiles and walks over to him.

 247 PICARD AND RUBY 247 
                   stop a few feet away from each other, their eyes
                   locked. They drink in sight of each other...
                   there's an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words.
                   She smiles... he smiles back. A satisfying moment.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              Captain's log, March 3rd, 2063.
                             The voyage of the Phoenix was a
                             success... again.

 CUT TO: 
 248 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - NIGHT 248 
                   Townspeople along the Main Street. A sense of
                   urgency -- something's going on.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              And it appears the Vulcan ship has
                             detected the warp signature and is
                             now on its way to Earth.

                   Suddenly something in the night sky catches their
                   attention. A BRIGHT LIGHT is moving down towards the
                   city. We now realize this is what people are reacting
                   to...

 249 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 249 
                   Just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the
                   massive VULCAN SCOUT SHIP SETTLING down onto the
                   ground. Dust flying everywhere. Windmill blades
                   spinning wildly from the exhaust.

 250 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 250 
                   squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's
                   happening...

 251 NEW ANGLE - ON A HILLTOP 251 
                   A good distance away, but with a good view of the
                   entire scene. Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi and Geordi
                   watching from a distance as the Vulcan ship LANDS.

 252 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 252                    Picard, Ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier Zephram
                   Cochrane watching the landing. People from town are
                   surging around them. Everyone is shocked and amazed at
                   what they're seeing. Picard watches with satisfaction --
                   this is the moment he's been waiting for.

                   Cochrane and Ruby are particularly awestruck.

 253 THE VULCAN SHIP 253 
                   settles, engines whining down... dust settling.
 254 PICARD 254 
                   moves to Cochrane, takes him gently by the arm.

 PICARD                              Doctor Cochrane... this is your
                             moment.

                   Cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple
                   with the moment.

 COCHRANE                              My God... they're really from
                             another world?

 PICARD                              That's right. And they're going
                             to want to meet the man who flew
                             that warp ship.

                   Cochrane looks at him.

 COCHRANE                              And that's supposed to be me...

 PICARD                              Zephram, you had the vision to
                             build that ship when no one else
                             on this planet could see beyond
                             their own problems.
                                     (beat)
                             You flew that ship... all I did
                             was push a few buttons.

                   Cochrane looks at him for a moment... takes a breath,
                   nods...

 COCHRANE                              All right.
                                     (beat)
                             And don't worry -- I'll keep your
                             secret.

                   They hear a mechanical WHIRR and a HISS of air.

 255 NEW ANGLE 255 
                   as a HATCH opens on the Vulcan ship. The townspeople
                   behind them react with shock and fear... a few people
                   take a step back. Picard looks at Cochrane, who
                   hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep
                   breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. A man
                   alone about to change the course of human history.

                   Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around
                   him... and he puts his arm around her.

 256 HILLTOP 256 
                   As the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment...
                   they glance at each other with excitement as they watch
                   history unfold...

 257 VULCAN SHIP 257 
                   Cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the
                   hatch swings completely open... light streams out into
                   the night air... and THREE HOODED, ROBED FIGURES
                   EMERGE. They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment
                   frozen in time.

 258 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 258 
                   watching in awe...

 259 PICARD AND RUBY 259 
                   watching...

 260 THE LEAD VULCAN 260 
                   pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted
                   eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that
                   austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his
                   race. He steps forward to greet Cochrane... raises his
                   hand as if to wave.

                   Cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave
                   in return...

                   But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic
                   Vulcan greeting.

 VULCAN                              Live Long and Prosper.

                   Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-sign...but
                   can't quite do the awkward finger-split.

 COCHRANE                              Um... thanks.

                   The Vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him. The very first
                   Alien-Human relationship is underway...

 261 PICARD AND RUBY 261 
                   are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the
                   scene unfold...

 262 HILLTOP 262 
                   Our heroes share a glance with each other and smile,
                   Riker taps his combadge.

 RIKER                              Riker to Enterprise. Five to beam
                             up.

                   The crew DEMATERIALIZES...

 263 PICARD AND RUBY 263 
                   have now moved away from the crowd... no one paying
                   attention to them. The bright lights from the Vulcan
                   ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette. Picard turns
                   to Ruby. It's the moment he's been dreading. This is
                   goodbye. She looks at him.

 RUBY                              You're leaving, aren't you?

 PICARD                              I have to...

 RUBY                              Where? And don't tell me San
                             Francisco...

 PICARD                              No. It's a lot further than that.

 RUBY                              It's the future, isn't it? Just
                             like you told Scrimm.
                                     (beat)
                             I knew you weren't from around
                             here.

 PICARD                                      (with humor)
                             No... I'm from France.

 RUBY                              I don't care if you're from France
                             or Venus... just take me with you.

 PICARD                              That's impossible.

 RUBY                              Why?

 PICARD                              This may be hard for you to
                             understand... but I'm duty-bound
                             not to interfere with you, or
                             anyone else here... any more than
                             is absolutely necessary.

 RUBY                              You've been interfering with my
                             life ever since I met you.
                                     (with meaning)
                             Don't stop now.

                   Picard struggles... he doesn't want to do this, but
                   he's torn between his heart and his duty.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I'm sorry.
                                     (remembering his words
                                      to Beverly)
                             But our fates lie along different
                             paths.

                   A long, difficult moment... then he lets her go...
                   turns and starts walking off into the night. She
                   stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her
                   eyes...

                   Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise. One to...

                   He stops where he is.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here. Captain, we didn't
                             get your whole transmission.

                   Picard turns, looks back at Ruby. Their eyes meet...
                   and he makes the decision.

 PICARD                              To hell with fate.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Say again, Captain?

                   He starts walking towards her. She sees him coming...
                   starts running to him. She throws herself into his
                   arms and he holds her close. They kiss. A magical
                   moment, then...

 PICARD                              Enterprise. Two to beam up.

                   They DEMATERIALIZE holding each other tight...

 264 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 264 
                   moving out of Earth orbit...

 265 INT. BRIDGE 265 
                   Riker, Worf, Troi, N.D.s. Picard ENTERS with Ruby.
                   Everyone reacts to seeing her there. Ruby stays in the
                   Turbolift, staring around the Bridge in amazement.
                   Picard takes her hand and leads her out onto the
                   Bridge.

 PICARD                              How's Mister Data?

                   Riker glances at Ruby uneasily.

 RIKER                              He's in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
                             says he can be repaired... but we
                             have to wait until we...

                   He glances at Ruby again, awkward. But Picard finishes
                   his thought.

 PICARD                              Return to our own time?

 RIKER                              Yes, sir.

 PICARD                              Then make it so. Have you
                             determined how to recreate the
                             temporal vortex?

                   Picard sits in his chair. Riker hesitates.

 RIKER                              Yes, sir. But Captain... are
                             we... all going back?

 PICARD                              Unless you'd like to stay.
 RIKER                              No, sir.

                   Ruby stands stock-still, staring at Worf. Worf looks
                   up at her with a Klingon smile -- teeth and all.

                   Ruby manages a weak smile in return, then moves off to
                   stand next to Picard.

 RIKER                              Bridge to Engineering. Mister La
                             Forge... initiate the temporal
                             vortex.

 266 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 266 
                   moving through space... and then the TEMPORAL VORTEX
                   forms directly ahead of it, as seen before. The ship
                   ENTERS the vortex...

 267 EXT. SPACE - THE 24TH CENTURY 267 
                   The Enterprise EXITS the VORTEX and into Earth orbit.

 268 INT. BRIDGE 268 
                   As before.

 WORF                              Incoming transmission from
                             Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.

 PICARD                              Onscreen.

 269 INCLUDE VIEWER 269 
                   Admiral Hayes appears.

 PICARD                              Admiral... what's the status of
                             the Borg fleet?

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              It's been destroyed. The Borg
                             threat is over.
                                     (beat)
                             Are you all right? The Enterprise
                             disappeared from our sensors for
                             a moment.

 PICARD                              We're fine, sir. It will take
                             some... time to explain.

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              I look forward to reading your
                             report.

                   The transmission ends. Ruby turns to Picard with
                   amazement.

 RUBY                              That makes two of us.

                   Picard gives her a gentle smile. OFF the moment...

 CUT TO: 
 270 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 270 
                   The great ship entering a Starfleet SPACE DOCK.

 271 INT. BORG HIVE/ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM 271                    Geordi is directing a work crew of a dozen engineers,
                   as they clean up the room and repair the damage.

 GEORDI                                      (to a couple of N.D.s)
                             No, no -- we'll have to rip out
                             this entire bulkhead. We'll need
                             new bracing members for the deck
                             above and below.

                   The N.D.s move off, making notes on their PADDS.
                   Geordi turns and sees Data standing in the doorway.
                   He's now been fully restored to his original android
                   self.

 GEORDI                              Data...

                   Geordi moves to him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

 GEORDI                              You look good as new.

 DATA                              You could say that I'm back to my
                             old self.

 GEORDI                              That's great.

                   Geordi's smile fades a little as Data walks into the
                   room.

 DATA                              Her remains... are they still
                             here?

                   Geordi points over to a corner, where some N.D.s are
                   about to close a storage container. Data walks over.
                   Geordi goes with him. The N.D.s move aside, and Data
                   looks down into the storage container. The broken,
                   mangles pieces of machinery are all that's left of the
                   Borg Queen.

 GEORDI                              I'm sending them to the Daystrom
                             Institute for analysis.

                   Data stares down at the remains with a haunted look.

 DATA                              I never realized how powerful an
                             emotion temptation could be.

 GEORDI                              Temptation? You said in your
                             report it was all a ruse... you
                             were manipulating her.

                   A quiet beat.

 DATA                              She was... a unique lifeform. In
                             her own way... nearly perfect.

                   Geordi smiles a little.

 GEORDI                                      (joking)
                             It almost sounds like you miss
                             her.

                   Data looks up at him -- his expression unreadable.
                   Geordi's smile fades. Data reaches out, closes the lid
                   on the storage container, turns and walks out of the
                   room. Geordi watches him go, left to wonder what Data
                   is really feeling.

 CUT TO: 
 272 EXT. MONTANA - HILLTOP - DAY 272                    Picard and Ruby walk up the familiar hilltop, and when
                   they reach the crest, we reveal...

 273 A MOMENT 273 
                   A large memorial cordoned off by a chain. A PLAQUE on
                   the monument reads "On this spot, Man and Vulcan met
                   for the first time... and changed the course of
                   history. March 3rd, 2063."

 274 PICARD AND RUBY 274 
                   step into view. They stare at the sculpture for a
                   moment.

 PICARD                              Welcome home.

 275 WIDE SHOT 275 
                   Picard, Ruby and the monument are at the gates of
                   RESURRECTION CITY as it is in the 23rd century. This
                   is the place where man first reached out to the stars,
                   and the architecture has a distinctive uplifting
                   feeling -- spires reaching up toward the sky.
                   Shuttlecraft and aircars are taking off and landing.
                   The tiny Western town is now a thriving, futuristic
 METROPOLIS. 
                   As Picard and Ruby walk towards the city hand-in-
                   hand...

 FADE TO BLACK.

                                                               September 29, 1995





 1 A BLACK VOID 1 
                   We can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like
                   razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...
                   the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an
                   eerie, alien cacophony.

 2 EARTH 2 
                   appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The
                   alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear
                   the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion.
                   Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we
                   REVEAL we are in --

 3 INT. BORG RECON CENTER 3 
                   The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is
                   only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.
                   We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the
                   technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
                   a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.
                   Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
                   what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can
                   still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.
                   Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,
                   vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.

                   All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad
                   IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The
                   screens show everything from written Chinese... to
                   Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel
                   footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of
                   space battles from the 24th century. The entire range
                   of human history dancing across the monitors. The
                   effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
                   is watching this is studying the human race.

                   There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
                   SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will
                   come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
                   voices speaking at once :

 BORG                              Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
                             9-8 through 2-0-8-4.

                   The images on the monitors now change to show us images
                   from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.

                   Again, it's a collection of still photography, video
                   footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-
                   bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of
                   enticing details. As the images race across the
                   monitors, we should learn the following.

                   -- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.
                   Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.
                   Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.

                   -- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
                   environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The
                   United States ceases to exist. All political authority
                   vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
                   Dark Age.

                   -- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
                   visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created
                   out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp
                   test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.

                   -- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
                   landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
                   him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the
                   human race.

                   -- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an
                   alien civilization brings the planet together as never
                   before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning
                   to solve long-standing problems with new technology.
                   We see an early replicator producing food for the
                   starving millions. A new World Government is formed.

                   -- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
                   an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of 
                   Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for
                   protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.

                   -- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
                   Trek universe.

                   Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES
                   the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a
                   shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's
                   voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic
                   inflection, speaks for the first time:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Stop search. Calculate temporal
                             coordinates. J-Fourteen.

                   Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to:

 4 EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE 4 
                   A huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser
                   shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the
                   Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The
                   Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

 5 A FEDERATION STARSHIP 5 
                   locked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire
                   DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.

 6 NEW ANGLE 6 
                   as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
                   decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this
                   is just one small part of --

 7 A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE 7 
                   involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged
                   in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships
                   turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. 
                   It's a spectacular sight.

                   The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading
                   off in another direction.
 8 NEW ANGLE 8 
                   In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking
                   a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking
                   quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it
                   doesn't look like it can take much  more of this.

                   Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in
                   from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship,
                   causing massive damage.

 9 THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E 9 
                   SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
                   starship.

                   The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful
                   vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the
                   last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more
                   muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
                   and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this
                   Enterprise is ready for anything.

 10 INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE 10 
                   The Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's
                   chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and
                   stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard
                   instant access to his officers. PICARD in the
                   Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at
                   the helm. WORF at Tactical. TROI at Communications,
                   various CREWMEMBERS at their posts. The ship is at Red
                   Alert and everyone is tense.

 PICARD                              Signal the Endeavor to fall back.
                             We'll cover them.

 TROI                              Aye, sir.

                   She works her console.

              11   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE & BORG SHIP                     11

                   The Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the
                   Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section. This should
                   also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the
                   traditional "bubble" shielding, the new armor of this
                   Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy
                   across the hull. The ship is undamaged.

 12 INT. BRIDGE 12 
                   The ship is ROCKED by the blast.

 DATA                              Dispersive armor is holding.

 PICARD                              Bring us about. Target Borg ship
                             alpha four, port side battery.

 WORF                              Port battery, ready sir!

 PICARD                              Fire.

 13 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 13 
                   As RAPID PHASER SHOTS leap out from half a dozen points
                   along the ship's port side. (NOTE: The phasers also
                   look different, more along the lines of a gatling gun).
                   The Borg Cube EXPLODES. The Enterprise flies through
                   the debris.

 14 INT. BRIDGE 14 
                   Including MAIN VIEWSCREEN, which has a view of the
                   chaotic battle surrounding them. Another Borg vessel
                   looms into view.

 PICARD                              Starboard battery -- fire.

 15 EXT. SPACE 15 
                   The Enterprise fires a burst of phasers -- but this
                   time, the phasers have no effect. We see a strange
                   SHIELDING appears around the Borg ship.

 16 INT. BRIDGE 16 
                   On the main viewer, the massive Borg ship looms closer.

 DATA                              The Borg ship has modified its
                             shields, Captain. Our phasers
                             will no longer be effective.

 PICARD                              Ready quantum torpedo.

 WORF                              Aye, sir. Only three left.

                   Another JOLT as we're hit.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              La Forge to bridge.

 PICARD                              Go ahead.

 INTERCUT: 
 17 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING 17 
                   Where GEORDI and N.D. Engineers are rushing about, hard
                   at work. Geordi is no longer wearing his VISOR -- he
                   now has artificial ocular implants for eyes. They have
                   a distinctive electronic look to them.

 GEORDI                              Captain, I'm starting to worry
                             about the hull integrity. We've
                             been running the support field at
                             full power for three hours

                   Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the
                   INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE. A vast CHAMBER crammed with
                   HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual
                   alcoves. They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls,
                   floor. This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg
                   that form a gigantic "hive" mind. The Borg are half-
                   man/half machine. No individual personalities. No
                   feelings. They have only one goal in life: to
                   assimilate new races into their collective. To become
                   a Borg is to experience living death. When they speak,
                   they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices
                   speaking as one:

 BORG                              Your defense perimeter is
                             useless. You will be assimilated.

 PICARD                                      (to Borg)
                             Break off your attack. By now,
                             you must realize you can't win...

 BORG                              Your opinion is irrelevant. We
                             are the Borg. Resistance is
                             futile.
 PICARD                              We'll see about that...

 19 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - CLOSE ON TORPEDO BAY 19 
                   A QUANTUM TORPEDO BLASTS out of the launcher and heads
                   toward the Borg cube. This torpedo is completely
                   different than the traditional photon torpedo. It
                   oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks 
                   toward the Borg ship.
 20 THE BORG SHIP 20 
                   as the quantum torpedo HITS IT. But instead of
                   exploding on the surface, the torpedo PIERCES the ship
                   like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily VANISHES
                   from view. The ship then EXPLODES like a star going
                   supernova -- bright light and shock waves.

 21 INT. BRIDGE 21

                   There are Starfleet satellites and space stations in

                   The satellites open fire, but they have little effect
                   on the massive Borg Sphere, which returns fire,
                   EXPLODING them in orbit.

 PICARD                              What?

                   Picard gets up, moves to Data's console.

 RIKER                                      (incredulous)
                             Some sort of suicide tactic?

 WORF                              Captain, I've found the Borg
                             Sphere. It's on the far side of
                             the planet...firing at the
                             surface.

 PICARD                                      (to Data)
                             Intercept course, full impulse.
                                     (to Worf)
                             Weapons status?

 WORF                              Phasers are off-line... we have
                             two quantum torpedoes left. But
                             the computer targeting system has
                             been destroyed.

 PICARD                              Go to manual.

                   Worf pops open a panel and a high-tech TARGETING console
                   emerges with a small MONITOR and a traditional CROSS-
                   HAIR in the center. Worf grabs the targeting hand-
                   controls -- futuristic joysticks.

 40 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE 40 
                   The ship is FIRING its weapons down toward the planet
                   as the Enterprise comes up over the horizon.

 41 INT. BRIDGE 41 
                   As before. Worf works his controls. A complex array
                   of grids, coordinate information, speed data, and other
                   weapons info on the monitor screen. He begins trying
                   to focus the cross-hairs on the Sphere.

 PICARD                                      (over above action, to
                                      Troi)
                             Track their weapons fire.

 RIKER                              They've seen us. They're taking
                             evasive action.

 PICARD                                      (urgent)
                             Mister Worf?

                   Worf struggles with the targeting system.

 WORF                              Target...

                   The crosshairs keep missing the image of the Borg
                   Sphere, which is now twisting and turning to evade us.
                   Troi reacts to her console.

 TROI                              Captain, they're firing at a
                             nuclear missile silo... in central
                             Montana.

 WORF                                     (struggling)
                             Target...

 PICARD                                      (worried)
                             Montana...

                   The crosshairs finally LOCK on the Borg Sphere.

 WORF                              Target locked!

 PICARD                              Fire!

 42 EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE 42 
                   The quantum torpedo streaks in from off-camera and
                   slams into the Borg ship. It penetrates the Sphere as
                   seen before... a long beat... and then it EXPLODES.

 43 INT. BRIDGE 43 
                   As everyone reacts to the destruction of the Sphere.
                   But Picard has no time for celebration.

 PICARD                                      (to Data)
                             Mister Data, I want to know the
                             exact date and time.
                                     (to Riker)
                             Give me a damage report on that
                             missile silo.

 DATA                                      (works)
                             Today is March second, 2063. The
                             time in Montana is oh-eight-forty-
                             five.

 RIKER                                      (works)
                             Looks like they damaged the
                             silo...

 PICARD                              Life signs?

 RIKER                              Can't tell. Long-range bio-
                             sensors are off-line.

                   Picard thinks for a moment... makes an instant decision
                   and turns to Worf.

 PICARD                              Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister
                             La Forge and a security team meet
                             me in Transporter Room Three.
                             Civilian clothes.

 WORF                              Aye, sir.

                   Worf works. Riker turns to him, curious.

 RIKER                              Captain?

 PICARD                              In twenty-four hours, Zephram
                             Cochrane is supposed to conduct
                             the very first warp test... from
                             a missile silo in Montana. If I'm
                             right, the Borg were trying to
                             change the course of human history
                             by killing him or destroying his
                             ship.

 RIKER                                      (nods in understanding)
                             And if they succeed, humans won't
                             make First Contact with the
                             Vulcans tomorrow.
                                     (beat)
                             As First Officer I should be the
                             one beaming down...

 PICARD                              Normally, I would agree. But in
                             this case, the mission requires a
                             certain knowledge of 21st century
                             history. You're many things,
                             Number One, but you're not much of
                             an historian.

                   He grins slightly, has to agree.

 RIKER                              Good luck, sir.

 PICARD                              I'll keep in contact. You have
                             the Bridge.

                   Picard EXITS...

 CUT TO: 
 44 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM 44 
                   Picard, Geordi and THREE SECURITY GUARDS are checking
                   their phasers and tricorders. Everyone is wearing civilian
                   clothes. Geordi has a large engineering kit... Transporter 
                   Chief pulling on a civilian jacket. She looks a little 
                   frazzled - it's been a long day in Sickbay.

 BEVERLY                              Will somebody please tell me where 
                             we're going?

                   Beverly joins them on the pad.

 PICARD                              Montana.

 BEVERLY                              Montana? Well, that answers
                             everything. Why the hell are we --

                   They DEMATERIALIZE.

 CUT TO: 
 45 EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 45 
                   Picard, Geordi, Beverly and the Security Team
                   MATERIALIZE on the vast, rolling plains of Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (continuing)
                             -- going to Montana?

                   Picard and Geordi take out their tricorders and start
                   scanning the landscape.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                             I have the silo, sir. Bearing
                             three one zero... distance, three

 PICARD                              Let's go.

                   They start walking...

 BEVERLY                              Go where? Hello? Is anyone going
                             to tell me what we're doing here?

 PICARD                              We're here to find Zephram
                             Cochrane. He may be injured or
                             dead.

 BEVERLY                              Cochrane... the inventor of warp
                             drive?

 PICARD                              Yes...

 BEVERLY                              But he's been dead for three
                             hundred...
                                     (realizes, long sigh)
                             Oh God... we've gone back in time
                             again, haven't we?

 PICARD                              I'm afraid so. If the Borg
                             succeed in preventing First
                             Contact with the Vulcans... Earth
                             will remain in the Second Dark
                             Age... an easy target when the
                             Borg arrive in the 24th century.

 BEVERLY                              Well, why didn't you just say so
                             in the first place?

                   Picard gives her a look. As they keep walking...

                   CLOSE ON A DEAD CREWMEMBER lying on her back. A sheet

                   the sheet, revealing the face of a crewman.

                   There is repair work going on in the b.g. Two medical
                   N.D.s stand by.

 TROI                              It appears death was caused by a
                             plasma discharge.

                             I'll note in her record that she
                             never left her post.

                   Troi glances at Data, who is clearly disturbed by the
                   sight of the dead woman, holding his EMOTIONS in check
                   with difficulty.

 TROI                              Did you know her?

 DATA                              Not very well. We met shortly
                             after the Enterprise-E was
                             commissioned. I found her to be
                             a most... promising officer.

                   Troi looks at him in concern.

 TROI                              Data... are you sure you're all
                             right?

 DATA                              I am still having difficulty
                             integrating certain emotions into
                             my programming. Grief, loss,
                             remorse...

 TROI                              We still have to make reports on
                             ten more crewmen killed in action.
                             Maybe you should deactivate your
                             emotion chip until we're done.

                   Data considers.

 DATA                              No. Human beings do not have that
                             luxury, and neither should I.

 TROI                              I will admit... there are times
                             when I wish I had an emotion chip
                             I could turn on and off.

                             Remain here. The gas is highly
                             corrosive to organic material. It
                             would liquefy your flesh on

 PORTER                              Be my guest, sir.

                   Data walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without
                   concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas...

                   ... groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs
                   hold of it... and with android strength BENDS the metal
                   conduit back into the bulkhead. The gas stops leaking.
                   Data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas.

 PORTER                              Right.

                   Porter moves around a corner, behind some equipment,
                   out of Data's vision...

 51 NEW ANGLE - PORTER 51 
                   who opens a PANEL on the wall. But instead of the neat
                   and orderly Starfleet technology, he is confronted by
                   a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling,
                   diodes and what almost look like arteries. Some of the
                   tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy. Porter
                   reacts.

 PORTER                              What the hell...

                   Porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops. Buried
                   deep within the tangle of bio-circuits is what looks
                   like a HUMAN FACE covered with cybernetic tubes and
                   chips. It's barely discernable in the darkness and
                   clutter. Porter isn't even sure what he's looking at.
                   He leans in for a closer look... and suddenly the eyes
                   open.

 52 DATA 52 
                   who hears a THUMP and a sickening liquid CRUNCH from
                   off camera. He takes a few steps in that direction.

 DATA                              Ensign Porter?

                   He stands there for a moment, puzzled. Then a faint
                   SKITTERING SCRAPE can be heard -- like tiny claws on a
                   metal surface. He  whirls at the sound.

 DATA                              Ensign... are you all right?

                   No response. Data walks around the now deathly quiet
                   room... turns the corner to where Porter was working.
                   He's gone. The open panel is still there, and there
                   doesn't appear to be any place Porter could've gone.
                   Data looks puzzled, takes a step forward when his boots
                   make a squishing sound. He looks down...

                   Nothing. Data quickly turns and heads for the door.
                   There's a metallic SCRAPE above him and he looks up --

 53 TWO BORG 53 
                   are climbing to the ceiling like two spiders ready to
                   pounce. One of them has Porter and appears to be
                   inserting some horrible Borg device into his head.
                   Before Data can react, the second Borg suddenly lunges
                   at Data.

 CUT TO: 
 54 EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - MISSILE SILO - DAY 54 
                   The SILO is buried deep underground, but on the surface
                   there is a large, poured concrete MISSILE DOOR.

                   Built to withstand a nuclear blast, the door has
                   nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the Borg
                   attack from orbit. There are large, smoking CRATERS
                   all around. Part of the ground seems to have COLLAPSED
                   to a depth of ten feet, like a sinkhole nearby. Picard
                   and his team approach.

 GEORDI                              This must be it.

 PICARD                              How serious is the damage?

 GEORDI                                       (off tricorder)
                             I'm having trouble scanning
                             underground. There's a lot of
                             radiation leaking from something.

 PICARD                              Probably from the nuclear warhead.
                             Cochrane was planning to use it to
                             ignite the warp drive.

                   As they speak, Beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
                   everyone injections.

 BEVERLY                              This will protect us from the
                             radiation.

                   Geordi moves to the thick, concrete missile door, scans
                   it.

 GEORDI                              I'm picking up faint life signs
                             twenty meters below.

 PICARD                              There should be an access hatch
                             nearby...

                   Everyone spreads out... looking for the hatch. One of
                   the guards -- LANGE -- finds it.

 LANGE                              Over here.

                   Everyone rushes over to him. There's a small HATCH on
                   the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and
                   brush. Geordi kneels down, starts working a complex-
                   looking LOCK on the hatch.

 GEORDI                              Alphanumeric lock. We need a
                             password to get in...

 PICARD                              I have the password right here.

                   Picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back.
                   He aims and FIRES at the hatch, which is BLOWN OPEN,
                   revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness.
                   As they start to crawl inside...
 55 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 55 
                   This is the "mission control" for Cochrane's test site.
                   The underground room is filled with 21st century
                   equipment, consoles and monitors. One entire wall of
                   the room is dominated by a huge METAL BLAST DOOR, which
                   is now closed. We will learn that on the other side of
                   that door is the nuclear missile/warp ship itself.

                   The ceiling has partially collapsed. Chunks of
                   concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
                   equipment...Only a few of the consoles are active, most
                   are dark or fritzing sporadically. The lights are out,
                   and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires.
                   Four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room.
                   It's a scene of destruction.

 56 PICARD 56 
                   and his team ENTER the dark and smoking ruin. Beverly
                   and Picard move to one of the dead men, while Geordi
                   and the Security Guards move to the other three.
                   Beverly rolls the man onto his back -- he's clearly
                   dead. The name stitched on his uniform says Rippert.
                   Picard looks up.

 PICARD                                       (to others)
                             See if any of these men are
                             Cochrane.

                   Geordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies.

 GEORDI                              Mitchell... DePaul...

 LANGE                              This one's a woman... named Kirby.

                   Picard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door.
                   As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk...
 57 THE DESK 57 
                   is littered with debris and various documents and
                   schematics. THREE PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned to a bulletin
                   board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and
                   two angles of his warp ship. The photos are odd-
                   looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of
                   cloth.

 BEVERLY                              There's a life sign behind this
                             door... about ten meters below.

                   Geordi moves to the door.

 GEORDI                              Blast door. It's designed to
                             protect the control room when the
                             missile is launched.

 PICARD                              There should be some kind of
                             manual release...

                   They hunt around for a moment. Geordi runs his hand
                   along the edge of the blast door. Picard turns to the
                   Guards.

 PICARD                                       (to Lange)
                             Get those fires out and then try
                             to restore main power to the
                             control room.

 LANGE                              Aye, sir.

                   The Guards move off.

 GEORDI                              Got it, Captain.

                   Geordi has found an emergency BOX with several
                   pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
                   "emergency use only." He pulls down the lever, there
                   is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly SLIDES
                   DOWN into the floor. We can now see the MISSILE SILO
                   itself beyond the door. Picard, Geordi and Beverly
                   step into...

 58 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS 58 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which
                   surrounds the Silo walls. In the middle is the WARP
                   SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM
                   missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and
                   with numerous modifications to the fuselage. The
                   cockpit is on the same level as the control room. On
                   the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix". The
                   missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES.
                   There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders
                   connecting the different levels. Beverly sees
                   something below.

 BEVERLY                              There.

 59 NEW ANGLE 59 
                   Two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
                   grating. They all scramble down the ladders past the
                   massive missile. (NOTE: Because of the design of the
                   Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few
                   shots. For the most part, our view is limited to
                   sections of the missile.)

                   Beverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the
                   metal grating. She scans him...

 BEVERLY                              Severe radiation exposure...

                   Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
                   their level. The side panels have been removed,
                   revealing complex circuitry within.

                   Picard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man.
                   It's ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw
                   on the Borg monitors. Beverly begins pulling devices
                   out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray.
                   Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties. He has a
                   youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
                   burns.

 PICARD                              It's Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                              I've stabilized him for now... but
                             he's in a coma and he's going to
                             need radiometric therapy. I want
                             to take him to the ship.

                   Picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out
                   a combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise.
                                      (no response)
                             Enterprise, please respond.

 GEORDI                              It could be the radiation,
                             Captain. Try from the surface.

                   Picard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to
                   orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at
                   stake and a lot to do. He turns to Geordi.

 PICARD                              Mister La Forge, listen very
                             carefully. If you remember your
                             history... in less than twenty-
                             four hours, a Vulcan ship will be
                             passing through this system. When
                             it does, this ship needs to be in
                             space, flying at warp speed.

                   Geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order.

 GEORDI                              I'd better get started.

                   Geordi goes to work. Picard bends down and carefully
                   hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry. Beverly
                   follows him up the catwalk...

 CUT TO: 60 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 60 
                   Minutes later. Cochrane is lying on the ground.
                   Beverly is kneeling beside him, unfolding a portable
                   stretcher from her medkit. Picard is checking two
                   combadges with a tricorder.

 PICARD                              It's not the radiation... and
                             there's nothing wrong with the
                             combadges... the Enterprise just
                             isn't responding.

 BEVERLY                              Jean-Luc, this man needs medical
                             attention, now.

 PICARD                              As I recall, the town of
                             Resurrection is about two
                             kilometers East of here. They
                             might have a hospital...

                   Picard looks troubled at the thought.

 BEVERLY                              What are we waiting for? Let's
                             go.

 PICARD                              It may not be that simple. This
                             is an extremely difficult and
                             paranoid time in human history.

 BEVERLY                              Are you saying they won't help us?

 PICARD                              I'm saying they might shoot us on
                             sight. You have to remember...
                             these people have watched their
                             entire way of life collapse around
                             them.

 BEVERLY                              There must be some good people...
                             even in this time.

 PICARD                              Let's hope so. Because if
                             Cochrane dies... the future may
                             die with him.

                   Picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put
                   Cochrane on the stretcher...

 61 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 61 
                   Riker, Troi and Worf studying a MONITOR which shows a
                   three-dimensional DIAGRAM of the Enterprise, which
                   turns and rotates as needed. The schematic shows
                   battle damage and repair efforts.

 WORF                              I have assigned two damage control
                             teams to locate the source of our
                             communication problems. So far,
                             they've had no success.

 RIKER                              Assign another team if you need
                             to. I want to re-establish
                             communication with the Captain as
                             soon as possible.

                   Worf nods and begins making notes on a PADD.

 TROI                              Are we in any danger of being
                             detected by Earth defense systems?

 WORF                              There were no planetary defense
                             systems in this era. Their
                             weapons were designed to
                             fight each other... not
                             extraterrestrials.

 RIKER                              We have to start thinking about a
                             way to get home.
                                      (to Troi)
                             Analyze our readings from the
                             temporal vortex. We're going to
                             have to recreate whatever the Borg
                             did to --

                   Just then the ship SHUDDERS and the LIGHTS FLICKER.

 RIKER                               Report.

 TROI                                       (off console)
                             We just lost main power... and
                             we've got Class-Three alerts all
                             over the ship. I'm not sure
                             what's --

                   An ALARM goes off on Worf's console. He reacts to it.

 WORF                              A ship-wide decompression has been
                             initiated!

 RIKER                              What?

 TROI                              We're venting our internal
                             atmosphere directly into space!

 62 EXT. ENTERPRISE 62 
                   CLOSE ON THE SAUCER as vents and hatches POP OPEN on
                   the hull and GIANT JETS OF VAPOR start blowing out
                   into space.

 63 INT. CORRIDOR 63 
                   Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the
                   floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the
                   Corridor. The ship is venting air into space, creating
                   a virtual VACUUM inside the ship! The people in the
                   corridor grab onto the bulkheads, struggling to hang on
                   against the force of the wind...

 64 INT. BRIDGE 64 
                   Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS.
                   VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone
                   hangs on. Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown
                   across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead,
                   struggling to hang on. Worf runs over, grabs her arm,
                   keeps her from flying out.

                   Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button
                   and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the
                   airlock and the wind DIES DOWN. Everyone takes a beat.

 RIKER                              What the hell is happening, Worf?

 WORF                                       (off console)
                             It appears that someone has taken
                             over the Environmental Control
                             Room.

 TROI                              Someone...?

 RIKER                                       (realizing)
                             The Borg.  Some of them must've
                             beamed over before we destroyed
                             their ship.
                                      (to Worf)
                             Seal off that entire deck with
                             emergency force fields.

 TROI                              Wil... Data was down there.

 RIKER                                       (to Worf)
                             Mister Worf... find Data if you
                             can, but your top priority is
                             isolating the Borg.

 WORF                              Understood.

                   Worf heads for a Turbolift. OFF Riker's disturbed
                   expression...

 CUT TO: 
 65 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE 65 
                   His eyes are closed. There's a beat, then his eyes fly
                   open and he looks around.

                   We PULL BACK slightly, revealing Data is lying on some
                   kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints.
                   He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable
                   to break the restraints. About two feet in front of
                   his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a
                   cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching,
                   hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...

                   Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as
                   it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside
                   down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment
                   as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.

 66 DATA'S POV 66 
                   As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And
                   we realize we're in --
 67 INT. BORG HIVE 67 
                   The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now
                   been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG.
                   The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical
                   jungle of cybernetic equipment.

                   The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet
                   technology and materials into the living, bio-
                   mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone
                   attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
                   it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
                   BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
                   inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower
                   bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.

                   The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
                   the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg
                   drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and
                   other conduits connecting them to various equipment...
                   while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying
                   out various modifications to the room. At one point,
                   we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified.
                   His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity
                   left.

 68 DATA 68 
                   still strapped to the table, which is twisting and
                   rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the
                   room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are
                   clustered together in one section of the room, each
                   with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
                   connected to its face.

                   Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and
                   ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre
                   "feeding" or "renewal" is going on. The tubes all seem
                   to lead toward the ceiling.

                   Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS
                   into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side
                   of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of
                   optical cabling to it.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             Your efforts to assimilate me will
                             be unsuccessful.

                   The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the
                   cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power.
                   They're trying to connect him to the Collective.

                   Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly...
                   and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the
                   cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the
                   cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts.

 DATA                                       (to Borg)
                             It would appear that resistance is
                             not always futile.

                   Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room -- 
                   a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Brave words. I've heard them
                             before from thousands of species
                             across thousands of worlds...
                             since long before you were
                             created.

                   Data looks up toward...

 69 THE CEILING 69 
                   A RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle...
                   almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. And
                   for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike
                   any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale-
                   skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back...
                   a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish
                   technology. And then it's gone.

 70 DATA 70 
                   Frowns. He saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make
                   of it.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              But now... they are all one with
                             the Borg.

 DATA                              I am unlike any lifeform you have
                             encountered before. As an
                             android, I am in complete control
                             of my neural net. The information
                             contained there cannot be forcibly
                             removed.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              You are an imperfect being...
                             created by an imperfect being.
                             Finding your weakness is only a
                             matter of time.

                   Suddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with
                   various wicked-looking Borg devices. One of the Borg
                   has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a
                   series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES. As the six-
                   inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Data's head...

 CUT TO: 
 71 EXT. MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 71 
                   Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people --
                   a rural, Western community that's probably existed for
                   at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of
                   the original ranching community in some of the
                   architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st
                   century.

                   The most striking feature of the town is that it sits
                   in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which
                   provide the only source of power for the town. The
                   blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them
                   are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek,
                   fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled
                   together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only
                   a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.

                   Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods
                   carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the
                   sight of the city and then head toward it...

 72 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY 72 
                   A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying
                   Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
                   end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of
                   post-apocalyptic 21st century life:

                   This is a recognizable American community, but it's
                   definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,
                   technology -- all have changed over the course of
                   seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used
                   to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
                   and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
                   CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements
                   now useless.

                   At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
                   the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
                   can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The
                   entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later
                   we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the
                   only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.

                   What used to be a McDonald's, or some other
                   recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has
                   been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are
                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
                   tongs.

                   The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate
                   in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,
                   others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of
                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
                   victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental
                   dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion
                   to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
                   elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as
                   people line up to get their daily rations.

                   A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
                   curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community
                   that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man
                   dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
                   weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He
                   stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks
                   off.

                   The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look
                   about them. They're going through something that makes
                   the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.
                   But there's also a toughness to these people, a
                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of
                   overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and
                   it's on the verge of collapse.

 CUT TO: 
 73 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 73 
                   A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an
                   operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the
                   table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The
                   doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered,
                   tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the
                   rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard
                   times. The light in the room is provided mostly from
                   the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light
                   bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital --
                   we get the feeling they have very little power.

 DOCTOR                              How long has he been unconscious?

 BEVERLY                              At least four hours.

                   He checks Cochran's head injury as Beverly takes out
                   her tricorder and scans him.

 DOCTOR                              It looks like he has a cranial
                             fracture, but I'll need X-rays to
                             be sure.
                                      (to Nurse)
                             Get Ruby in here.

                   One of the nurses runs off.

 BEVERLY                                       (off tricorder)
                             He has a severe fracture of the
                             left occipital plate. He's not
                             hemorrhaging... but the radiation
                             has damaged his KNA and his APR
                             cell count...

                   He looks at her curiously.

 DOCTOR                              "APR cell count?" What the hell
                             are you talking about?

 PICARD                                      (quickly)
                             Doctor Crusher has been...
                             studying some advanced medical
                             theories.

 NURSE                                      (re: tricorder)
                             What is that?

 BEVERLY                              It's a... new medical scanner.
                             It's a little more precise than an
                             X-ray machine.

                   The Doctor eyes it.

 DOCTOR                              Is it Japanese?

 BEVERLY                              Um... yeah.
                                     (beat)
                             Now he's going to need a
                             respirator. Do you have one?

 DOCTOR                              We have two... but we don't have
                             the juice to run them.

 PICARD                              Juice?

 DOCTOR                              Power. There hasn't been a lot of
                             wind through here for the last
                             couple of weeks. Most of the
                             batteries are depleted.

 BEVERLY                              Don't you have any generators, or
                             other fuel sources?

                   The Doctor throws her an irritated look.

 DOCTOR                              Maybe you'd like to take your
                             patient to the hospital in
                             Bozemen... it's only two hundred
                             miles away.

                   Cochrane wheezes -- breathing becoming labored and
                   ragged. Beverly scans him, urgent.

 BEVERLY                              His automatic reflexes are
                             fluctuating. We've got to get him
                             on a respirator.

 DOCTOR                                      (to Nurse)
                             Bag him.

                   The nurse picks up a portable respirator sack -- puts
                   it on Cochrane's face and squeezes the bag, forcing air
                   into Cochrane's lungs. Picard has been thinking
                   through this scene, finally has a solution.
 PICARD                              Beverly -- your tricorder.

                   She hands him her tricorder.

 PICARD                                     (to Doctor)
                             Where's the battery room for the
                             hospital?

 DOCTOR                              I told you, there's no --

 PICARD                              Where?

 DOCTOR                              Outside, around back. Next to the
                             water tank.
                    Picard rushes out the doors. Beverly checks Cochrane's
                   pulse.

 BEVERLY                              His heartbeat's irregular...
                    Beverly climbs up on top of Cochrane, straddling him,
                   begins giving him 24th century CPR. She takes charge.
 BEVERLY                              Adrenaline -- ten CC's!

                   As they rush to save him.
 74 EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 74 
                   The back of the building. Picard rushes out and spots
                   an old, dilapidated BATTERY UNIT providing power to the
                   hospital. He quickly yanks off the back panel,
                   revealing a tangle of wires, and several large
                   batteries. He kneels down, then removes the back of
                   the tricorder.
 75 CLOSE ON TRICORDER 75 
                   as Picard pulls out a small POWER CELL -- about half
                   the size of a dime. The blinkies on the tricorder go
                   out.

 76 PICARD 76 
                   holds the power cell with one hand, and starts pulling
                   out wires from the batteries with the other.

 77 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 77 
                   As before. Beverly, the doctor and the nurse trying to
                   save Cochrane.

 BEVERLY                                      (pumping his chest)
                             One... two... three... compress!

                   The nurse squeezes the bag. Suddenly the room is
                   filled with the HUM of POWER and ALL OF THE LIGHTS AND
                   EQUIPMENT COME TO LIFE. Monitors blinking, fluorescent
                   lights flashing on. Everyone reacts with shock.

 78 INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY 78 
                   It's filled with patients. The lights and equipment
                   here FLASH ON, as well. Doctors and patients alike
                   react with surprise.

 79 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 79 
                   Picard enters. They've placed a RESPIRATOR down
                   Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his
                   chest. Beverly has just finished giving him an
                   injection with a hypospray. The heart monitor in the
                   background is now beating regularly. The doctor turns
                   to Picard.

 DOCTOR                              What did you do to the batteries?

 PICARD                              Oh... just a little tinkering.
                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                              He's stable... for now.
                                     (with meaning)
                             But it would be better if we could
                             contact... our friends.

 PICARD                              Yes. But until then, you'll have
                             to make do with what you've got.

 BEVERLY                              That'll be interesting.

 A WOMAN'S VOICE: 
 RUBY'S VOICE                              What happened to him?

                   Everyone turns.

 80 NEW ANGLE 80 
                   revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of
                   Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late
                   thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under
                   normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her
                   best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard
                   day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the
                   most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence
                   we can see in her eyes.

                   She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard
                   realizes he has to say something. He looks into her
                   eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of
                   chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just
                   might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that
                   electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer.

 PICARD                              There was some kind of explosion
                             out at the missile silo...

                   She looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him
                   without expression, as though probing the truthfulness
                   of his statement.

 DOCTOR                              Ruby, we're going to need a series 
                             of cranial X-rays tonight.

 RUBY                                      (nods)
                             I have a fresh set of plates at
                             home. I'll have them here by
                             eight.

                   She turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently
                   takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection.

 RUBY                                      (quiet)
                             Take care of him. He's a very
                             special man.

 PICARD                              Yes, he is.

                   She looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight
                   feeling of chemistry in the air. And then she turns
                   and starts to walk out of the room. Picard's combadge
                   BEEPS. Reactions.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              La Forge to Picard.

 RUBY                                      (stopping)
                             I think there's someone in your
                             pants.

 PICARD                              Excuse me. I have a... telephone
                             call.

                   Picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out
                   of his pants pocket, taps it. Ruby watches him a beat,
                   then walks out of the room.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 GEORDI'S COM VOICE                              Captain, we have a problem. I
                             think you'd better get back here.

 PICARD                              I'm on my way. Picard out.

                   Picard moves to Beverly.

 PICARD                                      (sotto)
                             I have to go back to the silo.
                             Will you be all right?

 BEVERLY                              I'll be fine.
                                     (re: Cochrane)
                             He's a different story.

                   Beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll
                   have to work with as Picard exits...

 81 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY 81 
                   A short time later. Picard walking down the main
                   street back toward the gates. People passing him,
                   taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking
                   ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then
                   he stops.

 82 NEW ANGLE 82 
                   Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious
                   woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera
                   bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a
                   moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover
                   car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made
                   FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of
                   the car. She continues on her way. Picard is
                   intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is
                   she could be taking a picture of. Just then --

 MAN'S VOICE                              Catch.

                   Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal
                   canister with a screw-top.

                   The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT
                   SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia.
                   While not a physically threatening man, there is a
                   quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
                   intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility.
                   He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
                   carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably
                   one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as
                   radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came
                   true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his
                   friendliest face to Picard.

 SCRIMM                                      (pleasant)
                             Think you'll need that.

                   Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.

 SCRIMM                              It's no zone solution.
                                    (off his look)
                             You know. "No ozone."

                   He points to the sky.

 PICARD                              Oh...  yes... ultraviolet
                             protection. Thank you.
                             Mister...?

 SCRIMM                              Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant
                             Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of
                             the Resurrection Protective Force.
                                     (beat)
                             And you are?

 PICARD                              Jean-Luc Picard.

 SCRIMM                              Great name. French?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              You don't sound French.

                   Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never
                   leave Picard.

 PICARD                              I was raised in England and here
                             in the States. Thank you for
                             the... no zone.

                   Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any
                   citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him.

 SCRIMM                              Where in the States?

 PICARD                              Oh... here and there. You know
                             how it is.
 SCRIMM                              Not really. I was born and raised
                             right here. Never had much use
                             for travel.

                   He casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way.

 SCRIMM                              Where are you from most recently?

 PICARD                                      (thinking fast)
                             California. San Francisco.

 SCRIMM                              Beautiful city. Used to be,
                             anyway. I didn't think anyone
                             still lived there.

 PICARD                              There's a few of us left.

                   Picard steps around him and continues walking down the
                   street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him
                   again.

 SCRIMM                              That was a pretty clever trick you
                             did with the hospital's batteries.
                             How'd you do it?

 PICARD                              It wasn't a trick. I used to be
                             an electrical engineer.

 SCRIMM                              Huh.

                   He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but
                   a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard
                   realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.

 SCRIMM                              And what were you doing out at the
                             missile silo?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend of Cochrane's...
                             I wanted to see how he was doing.

 SCRIMM                              Lucky for him you came by when you
                             did. He might be dead now.

 PICARD                              Yes.

 SCRIMM                              Maybe you can tell me what he's
                             been doing in that silo. We heard
                             some explosions out there this
                             morning...

 PICARD                              I think he was running a test on
                             an old rocket engine... and one of
                             the fuel cells burst.

                   Scrimm eyes him evenly.

 SCRIMM                              You seem to have an answer for
                             everything.

 PICARD                              Something wrong with that?

 SCRIMM                              Not yet.

                   A tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily.

 SCRIMM                                      (re: balm)
                             Be sure you put that on. You need
                             a lot of protection around here.

                   He holds Picard's eyes for a moment.

 PICARD                              Thank you. But I've never had
                             much trouble protecting myself.

                   Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm.
                   Picard walks around him and heads for the gates.
                   Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression --
                   clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...

 CUT TO: 
 83 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 83 
                   in orbit of Earth.

 84 INT. CORRIDOR 84 
                   Worf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so
                   men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim
                   looks on their faces. They are carrying new powerful-
                   looking phaser rifles and other equipment. The feeling
                   is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous
                   mission. They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a
                   DECKPLATE, exposing a large HATCH in the floor. Worf
                   hits his combadge.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're in
                             position.

 85 INT. BRIDGE 85 
                   Riker in command, Troi nearby. Riker is standing at
                   the security station looking at a monitor which
                   displays a schematic graphic of the ship. The position
                   of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are
                   on Deck 46.

 RIKER                              This is the Bridge. I'm releasing
                             the emergency force fields.

                   He nods to Troi, who works a console.

 86 INT. CORRIDOR 86 
                   Worf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting
                   the hatch flashes off. Worf reaches down and releases
                   the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh. He
                   glances at his men for a moment, then JUMPS down the
                   hatch...

 87 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 87 
                   As Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power
                   on this deck, hard to see. He looks around warily for
                   a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist
                   beacon. We immediately notice that we can see Worf's
                   breath -- it's freezing cold down here. He shines the
                   light around the darkened corridor, then silently
                   motions his arm for the others to follow. A beat, then
                   we see the security officers start to drop into the
                   corridor from the hatch above...

 88 NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR 88 
                   As Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at-
                   the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers.
                   We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
                   own light sources, intended to illuminate the target
                   before you shoot at it. The Security Officers are
                   constantly moving their lights back and forth through
                   the chilly air. Worf gives hand signals -- holds up
                   two fingers, then a fist, and points forward.

                   Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet,
                   stop, and take up firing positions... then two more
                   members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them
                   and take positions further down the corridor. Classic
                   military deployment. Worf starts scanning with a
                   tricorder.

 WORF                                      (hits combadge)
                             Worf to Bridge.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here.

 WORF                              There's a dampening field in place
                             on this deck. Our tricorders are
                             useless.

                   The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky,
                   eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They
                   open doors, check room by room, section by section,
                   still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold
                   darkness.

 90 ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD 90 
                   The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall,
                   ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative
                   Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry
                   and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of
                   the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing
                   through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off
                   an eerie glow.

                   We can also see that some of the machinery has been
                   altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly
                   arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --
                   there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,
                   equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has
                   gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward,
                   examines the corridor closely.

 ENSIGN HAWK                              What the hell is going on?

 WORF                              Borg...

                   Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin
                   picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's
                   not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully
                   as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and
                   machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some
                   circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team
                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
                   unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.

                   Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue
                   their search. They continue making their way down the
                   spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...

 92 NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR 92 
                   where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE
                   in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the
                   ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The
                   deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a
                   low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this
                   corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen
                   earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird
                   pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at
                   the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly
                   into the room, but clearly something is going on in
                   there.

                   Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up
                   positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on
                   Environmental Control.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge. We're about to
                             enter the Environmental Control
                             Room.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Any sign of Data, or the Borg
                             themselves?

                   As Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign
                   Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation,
                   covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into
                   the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over
                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
                   Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where
                   the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,
                   throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of
                   darkness.

 WORF                                      (continuing)
                              Negative. However, they've
                              reconfigured the ODN network...
                              and re-routed all power on this
                              deck into Environmental Control.

                   As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time
                   when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something
                   MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes,
                   brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his
                   imagination?

                   A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing
                   happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can
                   only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping
                   out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the
                   Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that
                   something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT
                   around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of
                   circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast
                   we have trouble following it.

                   Worf turns his head at the sound.

 WORF                              Stand by, Commander
                                     (to team)
                             Where's Ensign Hawk?

                   Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there.
                   Everyone is alert, keyed up. The tension is thick.
                   Utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and
                   the frosty breathing of the team.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Worf? Is something wrong?

 WORF                              Something is very wrong,
                             Commander. We're falling back.

                   Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out. But
                   just as they start to fall back, everything happens at
                   once.

 93 BORG DRONES 93 
                   EXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS, CEILING AND FLOOR! What
                   follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and
                   furious we never get a true sense of what's happening.

                   A flurry of violence and motion and images:

                   -- A snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a
                      cybernetic nightmare.

                   -- Strange, bio-mechanical WEAPONS extruding from Borg
                      bodies, RIPPING into human flesh.

                   -- A crewmember PULLED into a bed of machinery.

 WORF                              Fire at will!

                   But the Borg are already on top of them. It's a brutal
                   fight in close quarters with no escape.

                   Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor,
                   bodies flying through the air... utter chaos and
                   terror. The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that
                   they don't have a chance...

 WORF                                      (throwing off a Borg)
                             Fall back!

                   The team starts backpedaling, FIRING as they go...but
                   the Borg are unstoppable now -- they put up personal
                   force fields to protect themselves.

 WORF                              Go, go, GO!

                   Worf pushes his men down the corridor. Everyone turns
                   and RUNS like hell. Worf bends down and grabs a
                   frightened Lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along.

 94 VARIOUS SHOTS: 94 
                   -- The team running through the corridors, SHOOTING
                      behind them at the pursuing Borg, to no effect...

                   -- Two of the Borg raise their arms and FIRE LASER
                      BURSTS out of their arms and wrists, taking DOWN two
                      Security Guards. Worf sees them fall but there's no
                      time to go back.

 95 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 95 
                   As Worf's team starts CLIMBING UP and out the dark
                   hatch in the floor seen earlier.
 96 INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR 96 
                   As the last member of Worf's team climbs out to safety.
                   The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf. He quickly
                   hits a few controls on his phaser, sets it to overload.
                   We hear the building WHINE. He JUMPS straight up into
                   the air, GRABBING onto the hatch rim, pulling himself
                   up. He barely manages to vanish from view just as the
                   phaser EXPLODES in a FIERY BLAST, taking out several of
                   the Borg drones.

 97 INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR 97 
                   The conclusive BLAST comes up through the hatch,
                   causing Worf to duck for a moment.

                   Worf reaches out to close the hatch, when a BORG HAND 
                   bursts up from below and GRABS his forearm. It's a 
                   test of strength. Worf reaches over with his other
                   arm, hits a control and the hatch SLIDES CLOSED,
                   SEVERING the Borg arm in a shower of sparks.

 WORF                              Worf to Bridge -- force fields!

                   The force field FLASHES into place. Worf and his team
                   sit there a moment, catching their breath, stunned at
                   what they've just been through.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              What the hell happened down there,
                             Worf?

 WORF                              Commander... we have a problem.
                    OFF Worf's shaken expression...

 CUT TO: 
 98 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK - DAY 98 
                   Geordi and Picard are walking down the catwalk ladders
                   toward the missile's massive engines. Now that the
                   smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a
                   bit, we get our first good look at the ship and the
                   damage done in the Borg attack.

 GEORDI                                      (on the move)
                             Cochrane was going to use this
                             solid rocket booster to lift the
                             ship into orbit. Before the warp
                             drive took over... everything
                             would depend on these old chemical
                             engines.
                                     (beat)
                             Now here's the problem...

                   They arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
                   a large section of the engines have been BLASTED AWAY,
                   leaving a deep, ugly SCAR -- broken conduit lines,
                   wires that now lead to nothing. It's clear that a key
                   piece of equipment has been destroyed.

 GEORDI                                      (re: damage)
                             This used to be the throttle valve
                             assembly.
                                     (observing it)  
                             It controls the thrust of the
                             engines. It's been completely
                             vaporized... and without it,
                             there's no way to launch the ship.

 PICARD                              Can you reconstruct the throttle
                             valve?

 GEORDI                              Yeah... if I knew what it looked
                             like. There's probably five
                             hundred ways to design a valve
                             like this...

 PICARD                              We need to launch this ship in
                             under eighteen hours...
                                     (beat)
                             There must be some design
                             schematics... blueprints...

 GEORDI                              We're tearing this place apart
                             looking for them... but the
                             computers are down, and the fires
                             destroyed half the files...so
                             far, nothing.

                   They look at the damage in frustration.

 GEORDI                              If it was just part of the warp
                             drive, I'd know what to do. But
                             this... it's like trying to
                             rebuild Orville Wright's airplane
                             with canvass and sticks.

                   Picard thinks, remembers something.

 PICARD                              Wait a minute...

 99 INT. CONTROL ROOM 99 
                   Moments later. Picard and Geordi are looking at the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   warp ship with people working on it. Picard spreads
                   them out on the desk.

 GEORDI                              Yeah, I looked at these already.

                   Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is
                   walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking
                   most of it from view.

 GEORDI                              You can almost see the throttle
                             assembly in this one... but this
                             guy walked in front of it when
                             they took the picture.

                   Picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his
                   jacket pocket. He pulls out the canister of balm
                   Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table.

 PICARD                              Could you reconstruct the throttle
                             from a photograph like this... if
                             that man wasn't blocking the view?

                   Geordi thinks it over.

 GEORDI                              Maybe...
                                     (beat)
                             Sure. Yeah. As long as I could
                             get a clear look at the intake
                             configuration. But so far, we
                             haven't found any other photos.

 PICARD                                      (staring at photos)
                             If there are other photographs...
                             I think I may know how to find
                             them.

 CUT TO: 
 100 INT. BORG HIVE 100 
                   It's a while later, and the Borg are making progress.
                   Data is strapped to the table, PANELS open on his HEAD
                   and CHEST. Three Borg drones are working methodically
                   on his inner-circuitry. The jagged voice of the woman
                   cuts in:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Your resistance is... illogical.
                             To us, your neural net is simply
                             another piece of technology. We
                             will learn its secrets.

                   Data stares at the murky ceiling.

 DATA                              Who are you?

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the Borg.

 DATA                              That is a contradiction. The Borg
                             act as a collective consciousness.
                             There are no individuals.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              I am the beginning... the end. I
                             am the one who is many. I am the
                             Borg.

                   Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS
                   the BORG QUEEN.

                   She is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen --
                   a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
                   of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED
                   by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face
                   and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty-
                   pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery
                   glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual
                   in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She
                   is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and
                   mechanical.

                   With the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself
                   down to where her face is very close to that of Data's.
                   Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint
                   in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness.

 DATA                              You are the guiding intelligence
                             behind the Borg...?

 BORG QUEEN                              Intelligence... ambition...
                             desire... I bring order to
                             chaos...

                   She studies his face with a certain child-like quality.

 BORG QUEEN                              It's unfortunate we will have to
                             destroy you to obtain the
                             information we need. You are a...
                             unique lifeform.
                                     (beat)
                             Synthetic... and yet far more than
                             a simple automaton.
                             You have no idea how close to
                             perfection you are.
                    She stares at him intently, and we get the hint that
                   her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation.
                   She seems fascinated by him. Data picks up on this.

 DATA                              How do you define perfection?

                   The Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating
                   herself.

 BORG QUEEN                              A blending of the organic and the
                             synthetic. The highest form of
                             life in the galaxy.

                   Data eyes her, considering.

 DATA                              An interesting definition. But it
                             is not one that applies to me. I
                             am completely artificial. I have
                             no organic components.

                   She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind.
                   She might've just found the chink in Data's armor.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever wondered what it's
                             like to have flesh?

 DATA                              It is impossible to imagine
                             sensations for which I have no
                             frame of reference.
                    She smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              That... can change.

                   The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them
                   a silent command. The drones immediately stop working
                   on Data's open panels... and shift their attention to
                   his right ARM. One of the drones tears off the sleeve
                   on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. Another then
                   uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic
                   skin from Data's arm. As Data prepares himself for the
                   worst...

 101 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR 101 
                   THREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run
                   into view, hit a control panel on the wall. A giant
                   EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down, cutting off the
                   rest of the corridor.

                   The security guards turn to run down the hall, but then
                   there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal.
                   They drop to the deck and take combat stances.

 GUARD #1                              Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation!

                   They make adjustments to their weapons just as the
                   bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash. The
                   guards shield themselves against the fire and debris...
                   looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
                   shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed
                   bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. The
                   guards FIRE, and when they do the PHASER BLASTS
                   alternate color -- red, blue, green, purple, orange --
                   a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency.

                   The phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG... but
                   then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the
                   other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no
                   longer affect them.

 GUARD #1                              That's it, they've adjusted --
                             fall back!

                   They turn to run but BORG PHASER FIRE lances out from
                   the Borg soldiers and RIPS them apart.

 CUT TO: 
 102 INT. BRIDGE 102 
                   The mood is tense, grim. Riker, Worf and Troi are
                   gathered around a SCHEMATIC of the ENTERPRISE. The
                   lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by 
                   the color RED, representing the Borg advance through
                   the ship. A they watch, another section of
                   compartments and corridors suddenly turn RED.

                   Riker lets out a wary breath, starts pointing to
                   various points along the schematic.

 RIKER                              All right... we've lost control of
                             eight decks... three Cargo Bays...
                             one Shuttlebay.

 TROI                              Do we have any idea how many Borg
                             we're dealing with?

 WORF                              We saw at least thirty...and
                             there are twenty-two Enterprise
                             crewmembers reported missing...
                             including Commander Data.
 RIKER                              We'll have to assume they've been
                             assimilated into the Collective.

 TROI                              Even Data?

 WORF                              Data's positronic net contains
                             classified information on the
                             Enterprise. Command codes,
                             security protocols...

 RIKER                              If they control Data, they control
                             the ship.

                   A grim beat.

 RIKER                              We can't worry about that right
                             now. Let's concentrate on what we
                             can.

                   They stare at the schematic.

 WORF                              To control the Enterprise, they'll
                             have to gain access to one of two
                             locations. Main Engineering... or
                             the Bridge.

 RIKER                              We have to cover both
                             possibilities.
                                     (to Troi)
                             We'll take care of the Bridge.
                             Worf, take your men and seal off
                             Main Engineering. Turn it into a
                             fortress -- nothing gets in.

                   Worf nods and EXITS. As Riker and Troi exchange a
                   tense look...

 CUT TO: 
 103 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT 103 
                   The hospital is completely LIT UP -- the only building
                   in town with this much power.

 104 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 104 
                   Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked
                   "X-RAY PROCESSING." The RED LIGHT is on above the
                   door, but that means nothing to Picard... who opens the
                   door and steps inside...
 105 INT. X-RAY PROCESSING ROOM 105 
                   Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals
                   and washes, etc. But everything has a slightly
                   futuristic and cobbled-together feel. They are
                   developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine. The
                   room is lit with an AMBER glow. As soon as Picard
                   opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice:

 RUBY'S VOICE                              Shut that door!

                   Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around
                   the room. Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals,
                   turns around in fury.

 RUBY                              What are you, an idiot? Didn't
                             you see the red light was on?

 PICARD                              Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize
                             that --

 RUBY                              Thank God this plate was already
                             fixed.

                   She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a
                   window) out of a tub of water... holds it up to the
                   light. And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a man's
                   SKULL. Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                                      (re: X-ray)
                             Cochrane?

 RUBY                              Yes... and I only had enough
                             silver halide for one shot. So
                             you're lucky you didn't screw it
                             up.

 PICARD                              I'm very sorry.

                   She glances at him, sees he feels genuinely bad. She
                   softens a little.

 RUBY                              Don't worry about it.

                   She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
                   dry off the pane of glass.
 RUBY                              Did you need something?

 PICARD                              Yes... I wanted to ask you about
                             some photographs I saw out at the
                             silo. There were three of them...
                             printed on some kind of fabric.

 RUBY                              Bed sheets.
                                     (off his look)
                             I used my last set of bed sheets to
                             make those prints. Not the best
                             material, but I haven't seen a
                             clean piece of paper in five
                             years.

 PICARD                              Did you take any other pictures of
                             the rocket?

                   The X-ray is now dry, and Ruby turns and looks at him.

 RUBY                              Sure.
                                     (jokingly)
                             Why, did you want to buy them?

                   Picard doesn't realize she was kidding -- jumps on the
                   opportunity to get the photos.

 PICARD                              Yes. I don't have any money right
                             now, but I may be able to get
                             some.

                   Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious? She
                   gives him a curious smile.

 RUBY                              "Money." So you can get dome
                             money...

 PICARD                              I can try.
 RUBY                              You'd have to try real hard. No
                             one's used currency in over ten
                             years. What are you, from another
                             planet?
                    Picard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off.

 PICARD                              No... but sometimes I feel that
                             way.
                                     (beat)
                             What I meant was, I'd be willing
                             to trade for the photographs.

 RUBY                              Trade. Okay. The photographs...
                             for a straight answer.
                                     (beat)
                             Who are you? And how do you know
                             Zephram?

 PICARD                              I'm an old friend... I met him
                             when he was doing his
                             undergraduate work at Cornell back
                             in --

 RUBY                                      (cuts him off)
                             'Fraid not.

                   Ruby walks past him with the X-ray...

 106 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 106 
                   Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor. She has a
                   satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one
                   over on this woman. And the truth is, she's enjoying
                   Picard's frustration. As they walk along...

 PICARD                              What?

 RUBY                                      (casual)
                             You're lying.

 PICARD                              What makes you say that?

 RUBY                              You're not someone who lies very
                             easily... so it's obvious when you
                             do... at least to me.

 PICARD                              Are you always sucha good judge
                             of character?

                   She stops, turns, looks at him.

 RUBY                              Always.

                   Ruby turns and walks off. Picard follows her, doggedly
                   determined to get those photos...

 107 INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT 107 
                   Beverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the
                   light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on.

 BEVERLY                              The occipital fracture is
                             widening... we're going to have
                             to fuse the bones...

 DOCTOR                              I'm a little worried about some of
                             these bone fragments. If they
                             move any closer to the brain, we
                             could be looking at a hemorrhage.

                   As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO
                   Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in
                   bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with
                   affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed,
                   watching her.

 PICARD                              Were the two of you... involved?

 RUBY                              No... not like you and Doctor
                             Crusher used to be.

 PICARD                                      (surprised)
                             How did you know about that?

                   Ruby looks at him with a smile.

 RUBY                              I didn't.

                   Her smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join
                   the Doctor and Beverly. Picard shakes his head and
                   smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same
                   time.

 RUBY                                      (to Doctor)
                             We can't take any more X-rays
                             until I can mix up a new batch of
                             the silver halide.

 DOCTOR                              Can you do it tonight? We may
                             have to operate.

 RUBY                              Sure. It'll be ready by morning.

                   Ruby turns and heads for the door. Picard moves after
                   her.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I need to talk to you
                             about those photographs. It's 
                             very important.

 RUBY                              I'm sure it is. But it'll have to
                             wait until tomorrow.

 PICARD                              It can't wait until tomorrow...

 RUBY                              Too bad.
                                     (beat)
                             Besides, it'll give you all night
                             to think up a new set of lies.

                   She flashes him that smile again, then darts out the
                   door. Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he
                   can't let it go at that...

 CUT TO: 
 108 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING 108 
                   Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing
                   for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty
                   phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking
                   weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons
                   aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security
                   Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons,
                   building makeshift barricades over each of the doors.

                   Worf is in command, directing the action.

 WORF                                      (to team)
                             Double check each assault
                             phaser... make certain that the
                             range setting is no more than
                             thirty meters. We don't want to
                             blast through the hull.

                   Worf turns and picks up his BAT'LETH SWORD off a nearby
                   console. He checks the sharpness of the blade.

 SECURITY OFFICER                              Are you sure you don't want
                             something a little more...
                             sophisticated, sir?

 WORF                              Mind your post, Lieutenant.

                   The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and
                   moves off. Worf makes a quick practiced motion with
                   the sword... decides he's ready.

 109 INT. BRIDGE 109 
                   Riker and Troi watching the schematic.

                   Riker works a control and the display ZOOMS IN to
                   display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting
                   Engineering and the surrounding deck. A SWARM of DOTS
                   representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering.

 RIKER                                      (to com)
                             Riker to Engineering. Mister
                             Worf...the Borg are approaching
                             your position.

 WORF'S COM VOICE                              Understood. We're ready.

                   Riker and Troi watch as the DOTS move closer...
                   closer...right up to the perimeter of Engineering.
                   The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks
                   like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants.

 110 INT. ENGINEERING 110 
                   As before. The security guards have taken positions
                   around the room, all weapons trained on the doors.

                   Worf is standing in front of the warp core, Bat'leth in-
                   hand.

 WORF                                      (calls out)
                             Charge weapons!

                   A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the
                   phaser weapons begin charging. It's tense -- everyone
                   standing ready with their weapons charging. This is
                   the moment of truth.

                   Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the
                   other. This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready
                   for battle.

 111 INT. BRIDGE 111 
                   Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of
                   the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now
                   completely surrounded Engineering on all sides,
                   including the deck directly above and below. In
                   essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the
                   rest of the ship.

 112 INT. ENGINEERING 112 
                   As before. Worf and the security team in their
                   positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they
                   start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere
                   behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering
                   through the walls and ceiling of an old house.

                   Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their
                   weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from
                   somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a
                   large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of
                   the room and travel to the other. There's an
                   overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
                   walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack
                   Starfleet troops.

 113 INT. BRIDGE 113 
                   Riker and Troi watching the display. The Borg dots
                   teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar.

 114 INT. ENGINEERING 114 
                   The clawing, skittering, clanging noises increase and
                   get louder...

                   ... we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at
                   any moment. Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth,
                   teeth bared. Unbearable tension and then...

                   The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually
                   disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is
                   even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the
                   room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest
                   sign of the Borg... but nothing happens.

 115 INT. BRIDGE 115 
                   Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots
                   begin moving away from Engineering. It looks like the
                   swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the
                   ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship.

 TROI                              They're bypassing Engineering...

 RIKER                              Where the hell are they going?

                   OFF the mystery...

 CUT TO: 
 116 INT. BORG HIVE 116 
                   CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE. His eyes are closed -- he is in
                   the android equivalent of sleep. CAMERA ROTATING and
                   PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping
                   sounds of VOICES from Data's past -- Picard, Riker,
                   Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own
                   voice... bits and pieces of his life...

                   The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for
                   humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling
                   him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of
                   dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more
                   human."

 BORG QUEEN'S VOICE                              Data...

                   Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK
                   revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg
                   operating table... his right arm and shoulder are
                   encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL,
                   obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell
                   into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the
                   tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the
                   room, carrying out various tasks.

                   There's been a change since we've been here last.
                   There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding
                   Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of
                   murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once
                   in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up
                   against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again.
                   We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're
                   definitely creepy.

                   Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do,
                   he's still immobilized.

                   Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward
                   the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It
                   stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to-
                   face with the Borg Queen again.

 BORG QUEEN                              You've taken your first step
                             toward perfection. How does it
                             feel?

 DATA                              I do not know what you are
                             referring to.

 BORG QUEEN                              That's because you haven't been
                             properly... stimulated yet.

                   A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by
                   the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down
                   slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data.
                   She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
                   Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and
                   moves away...

                   We can now see that all of the skin has been removed
                   from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of
                   his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on
                   the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
                   new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with
                   various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes
                   carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of
                   organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.

                   Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
                   puzzlement.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (re: flesh)
                             Do you know what this is, Data?

 DATA                              It would appear that you are
                             attempting to graft organic skin
                             onto my endo-skeletal structure.

 BORG QUEEN                              What a cold description... for
                             such a beautiful gift.

                   She smiles slightly, utterly confident. She leans her
                   face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm.

 117 EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATA'S ARM 117 
                   We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see
                   the individual hairs. The Borg Queen's LIPS move into
                   frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath. We
                   see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin, and the hairs stand
                   straight up in response.
 118 NEW ANGLE 118                    As Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in
                   surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before.
                   The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles.

 BORG QUEEN                              Was that good for you?

                   Data can barely describe the sensation. But clearly,
                   it was pleasurable.

 DATA                              It was... interesting.

                   He looks at her.

 DATA                              Do it again... please.

                   As she smiles...

 CUT TO: 
 119 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 119 
                   A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the
                   most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No
                   yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other
                   structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very
                   solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over
                   from the inside.

                   Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are
                   sitting off the front porch.

                   After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft,
                   feeble light.

                   Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size
                   plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the 
                   equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's
                   a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind,
                   with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several
                   stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the
                   jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a 
                   moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath
                   and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back,
                   trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An
                   exhausting day.

 120 PICARD 120 
                   is watching her intently from afar. He's concealed
                   behind a supporting beam of one the town's many
                   WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view.

 121 RUBY 121 
                   pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over
                   shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt,
                   revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off
                   long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots...
                   undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off
                   her hips...

 122 PICARD 122 
                   is surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This
                   really isn't why he came out here.

 123 RUBY 123 
                   kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and
                   panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt...
                   pulls it off...

 124 PICARD 124 
                   doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...

 125 RUBY 125 
                   moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a
                   large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves
                   and helmet attached.

 126 PICARD 126 
                   is a little relieved... keeps watching...

 127 RUBY 127 
                   has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit...
                   pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to
                   an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD
                   SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal
                   pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
                   pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks
                   over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the
                   sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump...
                   makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then
                   turns the spigot...

                   After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come
                   out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the
                   helmet.

 128 PICARD 128 
                   watches, curious about what she's doing...

 129 RUBY 129 
                   is now out of the bio-suit again... pulling on her
                   shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the
                   lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind
                   her. She begins walking toward the windmill.

 130 PICARD 130 
                   steps behind the girder, stays very still in the
                   shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill
                   without a glance and heads into town. After she's
                   gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches
                   her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...

 131 FRONT PORCH 131 
                   Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he
                   doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
                   RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.

 132 INT. RUBY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 132 
                   Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's
                   dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally
                   locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.

                   The house has only one room, which functions as a
                   living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also
                   Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,
                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
                   equipment all around. But the most striking feature of
                   the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed
                   PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are
                   hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-
                   air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of
                   furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced
                   Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --
                   bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of
                   carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,
                   taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace
                   quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a
                   feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.

                   Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to
                   photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
                   silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at
                   Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about
                   her...

                   She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
                   mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope
                   amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There
                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
                   a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.

                   At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.
                   It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
                   streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece
                   of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a
                   single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to
                   bloom.

                   Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then
                   pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a
                   box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see
                   PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a
                   younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way
                   it used to look... Ruby with a dog...

                   Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that
                   someone is watching him. He turns around to see...

 133 HIMSELF 133 
                   A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air
                   behind him.

                   Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the
                   street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a
                   telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks
                   focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of
                   the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by
                   the image. She's captured the essence of the man.

                   CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked.
                   Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's
                   there...

 134 RUBBY 134 
                   is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              You should pay closer attention to
                             those little red lights.

                   Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing
                   red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.

 RUBY                              You know, I'd be perfectly
                             justified in shooting you right
                             now.

                   Picard glances at the photograph of himself.

 PICARD                              I'd say you already have.

 RUBY                              Don't flatter yourself. I take
                             pictures of a lot of junk.

                   She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds
                   the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from
                   Picard.

 RUBY                              Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you
                             have a great explanation for why
                             those rocket photos are so
                             important you broke into my house.

 PICARD                              We're trying to repair Doctor
                             Cochrane's ship. It's been
                             damaged and --

 RUBY                              We?

 PICARD                              Myself... and a few other friends
                             of Zephram's.

 RUBY                              Friends from Cornell...

 PICARD                              Some.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's one. Keep going.

 PICARD                              A key piece of the ship has been
                             destroyed... and our only hope to
                             reconstruct it is if one of your
                             photographs shows us what it
                             looked like.

 RUBY                                      (considers)
                             All right. Truth. I believe that
                             one. Why is it so urgent you
                             couldn't wait until morning?

 PICARD                              We have to launch his ship by
                             tomorrow afternoon.

 RUBY                              Or...?

                   Picard has to come up with something -- decides to
                   throw her off with a high-tech explanation.

 PICARD                              Or the shielding around the
                             plutonium core will begin to
                             deteriorate. Within a day, the
                             entire silo will become so
                             radioactive that no one will be
                             able to come near it for a hundred
                             years.

                   Ruby eyes him evenly.

 RUBY                              Lie. That's two. One more, and
                             I pull the trigger.

                  Picard is starting to get angry.

 PICARD                              Why are you being so difficult?
                             All I'm asking for is to look at
                             one of the photographs. It'll
                             take five minutes.

 RUBY                              And all I'm asking for is the
                             truth. That would take five
                             minutes.
                                     (beat)
                             For all I know, you caused the
                             explosions at the silo... and now
                             you're trying to steal Zephram's
                             ship.

 PICARD                              I am not a thief...

                   Ruby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off
                   the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard.

 RUBY                              No, you're a petty burglar and a
                             liar...
                                     (beat)
                             You're no friend of Zephram's. He
                             is a great man. He's not like you
                             or me or any of the other zombies
                             walking around this town.

                   Picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality:

 PICARD                              No. He's a man with vision. He
                             can see beyond the problems that
                             surround us. He knows there's a
                             better future out there for
                             everyone... a future where crime,
                             poverty and war are things of the
                             past... a future where we reach
                             out and seek our destiny in the
                             stars.
                                    (beat)
                             I believe in that future, too,
                             Ruby. I believe in it in every
                             fiber of my being. And I'm
                             telling you... if we don't launch
                             that warp ship tomorrow, there's
                             a very good chance that future
                             will never happen.

                   She eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his
                   words have had any effect.

                   Ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her
                   gut...and finally hands him the photographs. Picard
                   glances through them -- his expression tells us the
                   photo he needs is in there.

 PICARD                              You won't regret this.

                   They share a look... and then Picard turns and walks
                   off into the night. Ruby watches him go... and we can
                   see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions.
                   Something about that man has touched her...

 135 NIGHT SCPOE POV 135 
                   A telescopic, green and white image of Picard walking
                   away from Ruby's home.

 136 LIEUTENANT SCRIMM 136 
                   is watching Picard through a set of night vision
                   binoculars, perched on the roof of a nearby building.
                   He frowns, wondering what Picard is up to...

 CUT TO: 
 137 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH 137 
                   The giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship --
                   a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for
                   communications and shielding. As we watch, FOUR
                   HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to
                   emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on
                   the hull. The Borg do not need pressure suits or
                   breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with
                   ease and onto the deflector dish...

 PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
 138 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN 138 
                   Where Riker, Troi, Worf and N.D.s are watching this
                   image on the Viewscreen.

 RIKER                              What are they doing?

 WORF                              They appear to be modifying the
                             deflector dish.

 TROI                              To do what? If they wanted a
                             weapon, they could've taken over
                             a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

 RIKER                              Deflector dish... why the
                             deflector dish...?

 WORF                              It doesn't make sense. The
                             deflector is only used for
                             shielding and long range
                             sensors...

                   Riker stares at the screen... notices something.

 RIKER                              Computer -- magnify grid twenty-
                             one alpha.

                   The image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific
                   point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of
                   two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish.
                   They appear top be modifying power conduits in some
                   fashion.

 WORF                              They're re-routing the deflector
                             power conduits...

 RIKER                              Computer -- thermal enhancement.

                   The image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what
                   they're doing. The power conduits are glowing bright
                   red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel
                   back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped
                   coil, which is pulsing.

 RIKER                              They're connecting the conduits to
                             subspace communications...

 WORF                                      (realizing)
                             They're converting the deflector
                             dish into an antennae...

 TROI                              They may be trying to send a
                             message to the other Borg...the
                             Borg in this time period...
 WORF                              What kind of message?

 RIKER                                      (thinking)
                             If it was me... I'd say "attack
                             Earth now... in the 21st
                             century... they'll be too strong
                             in the 24th."

                   They think about this for a moment as they watch the
                   Borg swarming on the deflector array.

 WORF                              We have to stop them from sending
                             that message.

 RIKER                              Agreed. Options?

 WORF                              Destroy the deflector dish.

 TROI                              Can we aim our dorsal phasers at
                             it?

                   Riker shakes his head.

 RIKER                              We've lost control of all weapons
                             systems... Transporters are
                             down... we can't get to a
                             Shuttlecraft... and it would take
                             us too long to fight our way down
                             to deflector control...

                   They think.

 WORF                              There is another way, Commander.
                             Do you remember your zero-G combat
                             training?

                   Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion.

 RIKER                              I remember it made me sick.

 TROI                                      (to Worf)
                             What are you suggesting?

 RIKER                              I think Mister Worf is suggesting
                             that we go outside for a little
                             stroll...

                   OFF their expressions...

 139 CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH 139 
                   Another one of Ruby's cloth-printed photos, this one a
                   clear view of the base of the missile engines --
                   Cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle.
                   Above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle-valve
                   assembly.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I'm almost afraid to say this,
                             Captain... but I think it's going
                             to work.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL we're in:

 140 INT. MISSILE SILO - LOWER CATWALK - DAY 140 
                   The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk.
                   Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of N.D.s attach
                   the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the
                   ship. The N.D.s are using high-tech welding tools and
                   sparks are flying. As they talk, they head back up the
                   catwalk toward the control room...

 PICARD                              Where's you get the alloy for the
                             throttle itself?

 GEORDI                              They used copper pipes in their
                             plumbing... so I melted it down...
                             and fused it with some tritanium
                             from one of our phaser casings.
                                     (beat)
                             It's not the strongest alloy...
                             but it's better than all this
                             crude aluminum and steel.

 141 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 141 
                   As Geordi and Picard ENTER. Lange is checking out a
                   launch console.

                   The room is now humming with power -- it's beginning to
                   look like the place is up and running. Picard stops
                   near the desk.

 PICARD                              Mister Lange -- have you brought
                             the computer systems back on-line
                             yet?

 LANGE                              Aye, Captain. This trinary
                             language is pretty archaic... but
                             I think I understand it now.

 PICARD                             Good.

                   As they speak, CAMERA MOVES in on the metal canister
                   of lotion Picard set on the desk earlier...

 142 EXT. MONTONA WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 142 
                   Scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a
                   cluster of military surveillance gear, listening to
                   Picard and Geordi's conversation. Far in the distance,
                   we can see the missile silo.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Are we on schedule? The Vulcan
                             ship will be here in less than two
                             hours.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              It'll be tight, but we should make
                             it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              What about our warp signature? It
                             has to be strong enough for them
                             to detect.

 GEORDI'S VOICE                              I've enhanced the plasma injectors --
                             don't worry, they'll see it.

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Well, with any luck... the Vulcans
                             will land outside Resurrection
                             tomorrow morning... and Earth will
                             never be the same again.
                    Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it
                   sounds like Picard is planning an invasion!

 143 INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 143 
                   As before.

 PICARD                              All right. I'd better start
                             familiarizing myself with the
                             flight controls.

                   A console BUZZES. Lange moves to it, and activates a
                   small color video MONITOR. It shows an external view
                   of the MISSILE silo, just outside the hatch. Beverly
                   can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious
                   Zephram Cochrane.

 LANGE                              Doctor Crusher's at the access
                             hatch, Captain.

 PICARD                              Let her in.

                   Lange hits a couple of buttons...

 CUT TO: 
 144 CLOSE ON COCHRANE'S FACE 144 
                   A short time later. His head is bandaged, and he's
                   conscious, but frankly he looks like hell. He sits
                   back, looking a little overwhelmed.

 COCHRANE                              Let me get this straight... you're
                             from the future... I'm about to
                             change history... and all I have
                             to do is sit here and let you fly
                             my ship?

 145 WIDER 145 
                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around
                   Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a
                   corner of the Control Room.

 PICARD                              That's right.

                   He studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He
                   smiles a little ruefully.

 COCHRANE                              And people say I'm crazy...

                   Picard smiles.

 PICARD                              I assure you, Doctor, that after
                             today... no one will ever call you
                             that again.

                   Cochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell.

 COCHRANE                              Just do me a favor... bring my
                             ship back in one piece.

 PICARD                              That's a promise.

                   Picard turns and walks off with Beverly. Geordi moves
                   to Cochrane with a little bit of awe.

 GEORDI                              Doctor... my name is Geordi La
                             Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I
                             shake your hand?

                   Cochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They
                   shake hands.

 COCHRANE                              I wish I could go with you. Is
                             there anything I can do to help?

 GEORDI                              Not really... but I do have about
                             a thousand questions I've always
                             wanted to ask you.

 COCHRANE                              Since time is short... why don't
                             you pick the top ten and fire
                             away?

                   Geordi smiles...

 146 PICARD AND BEVERLY 146 
                   have moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks
                   exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops
                   down into a chair. Mid-conversation.

 PICARD                                       (surprised)
                             You actually performed surgery...?

 BEVERLY                              It was an experience. Metal
                             scalpels... needle and thread...

                   She looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of
                   the medkit -- a surgical transporter.

 BEVERLY                                      (re: device)
                             But I had a little help. Surgical
                             transporter. I used it to beam
                             out most of the bone fragments
                             from his brain.

 PICARD                              How did Doctor Almack react to
                             that?

 BEVERLY                              He was so confused by what I was
                             doing, I don't think he even
                             noticed.
                                     (beat)
                             Any word from the Enterprise?

 PICARD                              Not yet.

 BEVERLY                              You think they're still up there?

 PICARD                                      (wry)
                             If they're not... we'd better get
                             used to living in Montana.

 BEVERLY                                      (light)
                             That might not be so bad... at
                             least for you.

                   She's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive.

 PICARD                              What's that supposed to mean?

                   There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's
                   attitude, she's simply making an observation about
                   someone she cares about.

 BEVERLY                              I saw the way you looker at her...
                             and I know that look.

                   Picard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's
                   a pointless conversation.

 PICARD                              Regardless of how I may feel about
                             Ruby... our fates lie along
                             different paths. Nothing can
                             change that.

 BEVERLY                              You want some advice? Don't do
                             this again.
                                     (off his look)
                             You know exactly what I mean.

 PICARD                              Beverly, there were many reasons
                             why you and I...

 BEVERLY                              I'd call them excuses. And the
                             first excuse on both our lists was
                             our "sense of duty." We convinced
                             ourselves that it was more
                             important than anything else. And
                             you know what? It's not.

                   She holds his look for a moment.

 PICARD                                      (neutral)
                             I have a ship to launch.

                   Picard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go...
                   wondering whether her words had any affect...

 147 EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - DAY 147 
                   Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump. The
                   plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid --
                   silver halide. She caps the jug, picks it up, begins
                   walking up on the porch...then hesitates for a
                   moment... looks out over the horizon.

                   She hesitates... then frowns and goes inside...

                   Ruby comes inside, sets down the jug... begins to pick
                   up some more glass plates... stops... thinks... looks
                   up. Only a few feet away is the large picture of
                   Picard. She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want
                   to think about him... but there he is.

                   She glances back at the open door... struggles for a
                   moment... then makes a decision.

                   Despite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head.
                   With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and
                   heads for the door...

 149 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 149 
                   in Earth orbit.

 150 INT. BORG HIVE 150 
                   ANGLE ON CEILING as the Borg Queen descends from her
                   nesting place down towards the camera... ultimately
                   stopping just a few feet away. She speaks directly to
                   the camera.

 BORG QUEEN                              How do you feel?

 151 CLOSE ON DATA'S HAND 151 
                   His right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color,
                   fingernails, hair, sweat. It's completely human in
                   every way. His fingers move slightly, and then the
                   hand begins to rise. We follow his hand as it comes up
                   and touches his FACE, which is also FLESH. The gold
                   color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking.
                   Even his eyes are real now -- blue. He touches his
                   face tentatively, his expression confused... but
                   intrigued.

 DATA                              Different.
                    The Borg Queen descends closer. Data's arms are now
                   free, but he is still restrained on the table. The
                   rest of his body is still android, mechanical.

                   Data touches his two hands together, feeling the
                   sensations, flesh against machine. He touches his face
                   and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way.

 DATA                              My internal sensors tell me the
                             ambient temperature in the room is
                             ten point two degrees Celsius...
                                     (wondrous)
                             But my skin tells me it is cold.

                   As he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by
                   his own newfound senses.

 DATA                              My visual acuity has been reduced
                             by seventy-eight percent... and I
                             can no longer perceive light
                             beyond the ultraviolet or the
                             infrared...
                                     (beat)
                             But I can see.

                   It's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling
                   and emotion like he's never had before. The Borg Queen
                   watches, pleased. She hovers close to him.

 BORG QUEEN                              Until today... your emotions were
                             trapped inside an artificial
                             shell. You didn't know what it
                             was to truly feel.
                                     (beat)
                             And there's so much more for you
                             to experience.  I will guide you
                             into a world of sensation unlike
                             anything you can imagine.
                                     (beat)
                             All you have to do... is give us
                             access to your neural net.

                   Data looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality.

 DATA                              No. I will not betray my friends.

 BORG QUEEN                              They're not your friends...
                             they've held you back... kept you
                             from your destiny...

 DATA                              That is not true. They have tried
                             to help me.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have they given you what I have
                             given you? Did they even try?

 DATA                              I... do not want this...

                   But his words have a certain hollow quality to them.
                   He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the
                   Borg Queen notes this immediately. She reaches out
                   with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek.

 BORG QUEEN                              You're becoming more human all the 
                             time, Data. Now you're learning 
                             how to lie.

 DATA                              I wish to... go back to the way I
                             was.

 BORG QUEEN                              More lies.

                   She SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the
                   pain, the shock. A small trickle of blood comes from
                   his mouth. He looks at her in surprise, but before he
                   can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on
                   the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and
                   erotic moment. She pulls back. Data reels, trying to
                   sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain.
                   Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer
                   to him, face-to-face... seductive... beguiling.

 BORG QUEEN                              Have you ever know a woman? Do
                             you know what it's like to feel
                             her breath on your face... her
                             skin against yours... flesh
                             against flesh?

 DATA                              My creator did not intend for me
                             to experience these things.

 BORG QUEEN                              I'm your creator now.

                   She rubs her body against his, cat-like... then pulls
                   him to her and kisses him deeply. Off the image of
                   their bizarre embrace...

 CUT TO: 
 152 INT. BRIDGE 152 
                   Riker, Worf, and three Security N.D.s are pulling on
                   SPACESUITS. The suits are form-fitting, sleek, no
                   bulky oxygen tanks. The helmets are the same -- they
                   conform to the contours of the skull and face.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             You will have to realign the
                             targeting array of the quantum
                             torpedo... and reprogram the
                             warhead for the localized
                             detonation.
                                     (beat)
                             There's only one torpedo left...
 RIKER                              I guess I'd better get it right
                             the first time.

 WORF                                      (to all)
                             The Borg will undoubtedly attack.
                             Set phasers to rotating
                             modulation.

                   The Security Officers check their phasers and wait as
                   Riker and Worf finish putting on their suits. Riker
                   straps a tool case to his suit.

 RIKER                              Ready?

                   Everyone nods. Riker goes to a wall panel and
                   activates the control. The Airlock door seen earlier
                   OPENS. Riker turns back to Troi.

 TROI                              Good luck.

                   Riker nods. Then he, Worf, and the Guards ENTER the
                   airlock and Troi close the door behind them.

 153 INT. AIRLOCK 153 
                   A tiny room separating the Bridge from the outer hull.

 RIKER                              Depressurize.

                   Worf hits a control and the room DEPRESSURIZES with a
 HISSING SOUND. 
 WORF                                      (to others)
                             Activate magnetic constrictors.

                   They all activate controls on their wrists and there is
                   a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized.

                   Riker hits another control and the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR
                   SLIDES OPEN, revealing the vast vacuum of SPACE. They
                   begin to walk out of the airlock...

 154 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK 154 
                   As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
                   top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as
                   the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready,
                   marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The
                   scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which
                   hangs above the ship.

             155   ON RIKER & WORF                                            155

                   As they approach the edge. Worf gives a hand signal
                   and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical
                   deployment and drops down onto their bellies. They
                   crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause.
                   Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy.

 WORF                                      (to Riker)
                             Are you alright? 

 RIKER                              Just a little queasy...

 WORF                              Try not to look at the stars...
                             keep your eyes on the ship.

 RIKER                              Right.

 WORF                              And Commander, whatever you do...
                             do not vomit in your exo-suit. It
                             would be... unpleasant.

 RIKER                              I'll keep that in mind.

                   Riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself.

 RIKER                                      (to all)
                             Over and under!

                   They all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the
                   underside of the saucer.

                   The CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they
                   traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're
                   upside down relative to their previous position, but
                   there's no up or down in space and their magnetized
                   suits hold them to the hull.

                   It's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to
                   their new position. From this angle, the Enterprise
                   appears to be upside down!
                    Once they're on the underside of the saucer, they can
                   see the rest of the ship laid out above them.

 156 NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV 156 
                   The deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered
                   with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify
                   it. Some of them turn and see us.

 157 RIKER AND WORF 157 
                   Begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer.
                   (Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the
                   hull at all times.) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past
                   them as the Borg open fire.

 158 THE BORG 158 
                   A DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin
                   skittering down (which is normally up) the
                   interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes
                   like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight.

 159 A SECURITY GUARD 159 
                   Is HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space.

 160 THE TORPEDO TUBE 160 
                   Riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends
                   down and opens the hatch. Borg phaser shots hitting
                   all around him. The open hatch cover provides some
                   protection from the Borg fire.

 RIKER                              Worf! I'm going to need at least
                             five minutes!

 WORF                              Understood!

                   Worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin
                   exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg.

                   They pick off a few Borg, who also go FLYING into
                   space. As Riker begins to work...

                   Picard, Geordi making final adjustments to the control
                   panels. Both are wearing 21st century communications
                   headsets. Picard exchanges a look with Geordi.

 PICARD                              Ready to make a little history?

 GEORDI                              Always am.

 PICARD                              Phoenix to control.

 164 INT. CONTROL ROOM 164 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s watching the countdown.
                   Suddenly a console BUZZES. Lange goes to the monitor
                   seen earlier, hits a switch -- the monitor comes alive,
                   shows that Ruby is now standing outside at the hatch.
                   Lange reacts in surprise.

                   Picard and Geordi working the controls, watching the
                   readings, etc. We hear Lange's com voice:

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              Phoenix, we have a problem out
                             here. There's a woman at the
                             outer hatch... says her name's
                             Ruby Sloan and she wants to see
                             the Captain.

                   Picard and Geordi react -- her timing is pretty bad.

 LANGE'S COM VOICE                              What do you want me to do, sir?

 GEORDI                              We can't let her in... she'll see
                             Cochrane isn't making the flight.

 PICARD                              We can't leave her out there.
                             When the ship launches... she'll
                             be killed.

 GEORDI                              Tell her to go back to
                             Resurrection.

 PICARD                              She's a very... determined woman.

 166 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 166 
                   Ruby standing by the hatch, trying to look calm...
                   Scrimm and three Militia Soldiers holding her at
                   gunpoint. The hatch hisses and POPS OPEN. Scrimm
                   shoves a gun into Ruby's side -- get going. As they
                   start to crawl inside...

 167 INT. CONTROL ROOM 167 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have focused their attention
                   on the countdown. Ruby climbs down the ladder, a tense
                   look on her face.

 LANGE                              Ms. Sloane, if you'll have a seat,
                             I'll let you talk to --

                   Suddenly, the three heavily-armed militia soldiers jump
                   down the ladder from the hatch. One of the Starfleet
                   N.D.s goes for a phaser, and a soldier BLASTS him
                   backward with a spray of bullets from his automatic
                   weapon. Everyone else freezes. A tense beat, then
                   Scrimm climbs down the ladder and looks around the
                   room...

 CUT TO: 
 168 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - BATTLE ON THE HULL 168 
                   Riker in the torpedo tube, frantically working. He
                   begins to physically MOVE the torpedo tube itself like
                   he's moving the barrel of a huge cannon... as he
                   struggles to aim it toward the huge deflector dish...

 169 WORF AND THE SECURITY GUARDS 169 
                   are about fifty feet away from Riker. From their prone
                   positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, BLASTING
                   them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover
                   behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of
                   the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of
                   metal to get to them, making then easy targets.

                   Suddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector
                   dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES
                   directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the
                   dish and flying through the vacuum of space like
                   paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too
                   many targets to defend from above and below. One of
                   the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a
                   vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES
                   the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing
                   the man instantly. Worf FIRES  a phaser blast into the
                   Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space.

                   Worf turns to Riker.

 WORF                              Commander, you're five minutes are
                             up!

 170 RIKER 170 
                   swings the torpedo tube into place, aiming it at the
                   deflector dish. He hits a control on the side of the
                   tube... and a QUANTUM TORPEDO automatically slides up
                   from below and LOCKS INTO position in the tube, like a
                   panel on the torpedo and begins working on the
                   circuitry.

 171 INT. BRIDGE 171 
                   Troi in command, watching the VIEWSCREEN, which shows

 SERGEANT                              No good, sir. They're on internal

                             withstand a nuclear attack.

                   Scrimm looks frustrated for a moment...then turns his
                   attention to Ruby.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Mister Picard... this is
                             Lieutenant Scrimm. I'm going to
                             have to insist that you shut down
                             the launch. You see, I know what
                             you're doing... and I'm not going
                             to just stand by and let it
                             happen.

                             who'll be first.

                   As Picard reacts in shock...

 INTERCUT:

                   Scrimm is now holding Ruby by the arm. He shoves the
                   com headset to her mouth.

 SCRIMM                              Say hello...

                   Ruby is scared, but trying to keep it together.

                   Picard reacts to her voice, but keeps working the
                   controls, trying to concentrate. Scrimm draws his gun.

 SCRIMM                              Go ahead -- launch it. Ruby will
                             be here when you get back... but
                             she won't have a whole lot to say.

 176 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 176 
                   Geordi and Picard exchange a tense look. Picard
                   struggles. It's a difficult moment -- what does he do?
                   The countdown clock is approaching 15 seconds...14...

                   Everything hangs in the balance -- Ruby's life, the
                   future of the Earth, Picard's feelings, his duty...

                   Finally, Picard reaches out hits a control -- the
                   countdown clock stops at 11 seconds.

 GEORDI                              Captain --

                             This is Picard. I've suspended
                             the launch sequence.

 SCRIMM'S COM VOICE                              Thanks. Now, why don't you join
                             us and we'll have a little talk?

                   Picard unstraps himself and takes off the headset.

 GEORDI                              Captain... we've got less than ten
                             minutes before that Vulcan ship
                             leaves the system. We've got to
                             go now.

 PICARD                              It'll have to wait. Come on.

                   Geordi quickly starts unstrapping himself...

 177 INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK 177 
                   Picard and Geordi stop outside the massive blast doors,
                   which are separating them from the control room.

 PICARD                              Geordi, can you see into the room?

                   Geordi looks at the blast doors... and he does so, the
                   electronic PUPILS in his eyes rotate, change shape and
                   color.

 GEORDI                              No... the door's too thick.

 PICARD                                      (frustrated)
                             Then we'll just have to assume
                             it's still there...

 GEORDI                              What's still there?

 PICARD                              Get a tricorder. You're going to
                             have to track my exact position in
                             that room...

                   panel... turns and reaches for the fire control
                   mechanism. She glances up -- there's a BORG flying
                   through space directly at him! Riker tries to bring up
                   his phaser, but it's too late. The Borg SLAMS into
                   him.

                   Riker makes a desperate grab for the torpedo tube itself,
                   trying to hold on, but the momentum of the Borg impact
                   is too great -- they both tumble off into space together,
                   away from the ship.

                   Scrimm smirks at him -- what gall this guy has. But
                   Ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in Picard's
                   words. She frowns in puzzlement.

                   Picard looks at Ruby, and at that moment something on
                   a console behind her catches his eye: a LIGHT on
                   Beverly's SURGICAL TRANSPORTER is now FLASHING. No one
                   else notices.

 SCRIMM                              You're an entertaining man, Mister
                             Picard. But you're also full of
                             shit.

                   Scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding
                   to Ruby's head. The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop Scrimm.

 PICARD                              Now, Geordi!

                   -- The gun in Scrimm's hand DEMATERIALIZES. Scrimm
                   reacts in shock.

                   -- Instantly, the gun REMATERIALIZES in Picard's
                   outstretched hand. He quickly pushes the barrel to
                   Scrimm's forehead.

 PICARD                              Actually, you're full of shit.

                   Everyone is in the room stunned by what's happened.
                   Picard takes charge before anyone can recover.

 PICARD                                      (continuing)
                             Now, tell your men to drop their
                             weapons.

                   There's a beat, but then Scrimm sees he has little
                   choice.

 SCRIMM                              Weapons... down.

                   The other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which
                   are quickly picked up by Beverly and a Starfleet N.D.
                   Picard hands his gun to Lange, who covers Scrimm with
                   it.

                   Ruby turns to Picard.

 PICARD                              Are you all --

                   Ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close.
                   He hugs her back, grateful she's alive. Ruby pulls
                   away.

 RUBY                              I think you have a plane to catch.

                   Picard smiles and heads back toward the Phoenix...

                   Geordi and Picard strapping themselves back in...

 196 EXT. SPACE - RIKER 196 
                   reaches the torpedo tube, pulls up the firing control
                   mechanism, which shows a monitor screen with a cross-
                   hair targeting display. He activates the monitor,
                   which begins tracking over toward the deflector dish.

                   Picard and Geordi's hands are flying across the
                   controls...

 199 EXT. SPACE - RIKER 199 
                   clamps a conduit into a power junction... then grabs
                   hold of a rotating lever inside the tube and TURNS it.
                   He ducks out of the way as the torpedo is LAUNCHED with
                   a ROAR.

 200 WIDER 200 
                   As the torpedo streaks out from the saucer section and
                   slams into the deflector dish. The dish EXPLODES in a
                   burst of FLAME... blowing away the Borg who were
                   working on it...

 201 INT. MISSSILE SILO - PHOENIX ENGINES 201 
                   As they IGNITE and start pouring out sheets of FLAME.

                   which is shuddering and shaking...

                   React with smiles. They did it.

 204 INT. BRIDGE 204 
                   Troi and the other N.D.s react with relief. The
                   countdown on the monitors are stopped at 00:03.

 205 EXT. MONTANA - MISSILE SILO - WIDE SHOT - DAY 205 
                   as the concrete missile doors slide open and the
                   Phoenix is LAUNCHED up into the sky, riding a pillar of
                   fire and smoke. This is our first real look at the
                   ship and it resembles an oversized ICBM with a
                   specialized cockpit on top.

 206 INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM 206 
                   Lange and the other N.D.s have the militia soldiers
                   under guard. Ruby is watching the missile launch on a
                   video monitor. She smiles.

 207 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 207 
                   Picard and Geordi working the controls as the ship
                   bounces and shakes.

                   The g-forces push them back into their seats.

                             intake valve.

 GEORDI                              Ignore it. We'll be fine.
                                     (beat)

                   As before.

 GEORDI                              Three... two... one... mark!

 210 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 210 
                   The rocket booster SHUTS DOWN as the ship leaves
                   Earth's orbit and coasts on its momentum. After a
                   beat, the first stage booster separates from the ship
                   and DROPS AWAY, leaving three-quarters of the ship in
                   space.

 211 INT. BORG HIVE 211 
                   CLOSE ON DATA, head tilted back, eyes closed,
                   smiling...a few droplets of WATER fall from above onto
                   his face. He smiles wider, reveling in the sensation.

 212 WIDER 212 
                   Data is still restrained on the table, but a conduit
                   has been placed above his head and is dripping
                   condensation onto his face. Data is now a completely
                   new being. His entire BODY is now made of HUMAN FLESH.
                   It's a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered
                   what Data would look like human, we're now getting our
                   first look.

 213 THE BORG QUEEN 213 
                   DESCENDS from her nest in the ceiling. She watches
                   Data for a moment... rubs the moisture into his face.

 BORG QUEEN                              A Borg in all but name.

                   Data, although clearly enraptured with his new
                   sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain
                   his own sense of identity.

 DATA                                      (weak)
                             I am... grateful for what you have
                             given me. But I still do not wish
                             to be assimilated.

 BORG QUEEN                              A universe of sensation is waiting
                             for you... don't you want to
                             explore it... with me?

                   To his surprise, Data finds that he is becoming drawn
                   to this strange creature and all that she can offer
                   him.

 DATA                              Yes...

 BORG QUEEN                              Then take the final step... give
                             me the Enterprise... and we can be
                             together... always.

                   He struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer.

 DATA                              No... I cannot.

                   Without taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out
                   a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. The
                   color of Data's FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY --  as though
                   the blood has drained from his skin. Another droplet
                   of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this
                   time his eyes widen in shock.

                   The sensation of human feeling is gone.

 BORG QUEEN                              I've deactivated the sensory
                             inputs. That flesh on your body
                             is just meat, now.

 DATA                              No... no, please... you cannot...

                   She moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her
                   voice:

 BORG QUEEN                              You must give me what I want...
                             now. Without the deflector dish,
                             we can no longer send for an early
                             invasion. We must assimilate
                             Earth ourselves. I need this
                             ship.

                   She hits the control, and the COLOR returns to his
                   face. Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again.
                   The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her
                   attitude seductive and affectionate once again.

 BORG QUEEN                              Isn't it better like this...?

 DATA                              Yes... but the Enterprise... my
                             duty...

 BORG QUEEN                              ... is to yourself. Don't make me
                             hurt you again...

                   She touches the control again. Data is shocked back
                   into his cold, android self. He's like a heroin addict
                   being denied his "high" with the flick of a switch.

 DATA                              No... no, it's so... empty...
                             please... give it back... I need
                             it...

 BORG QUEEN                              And I need to control this ship.
                             Let me into your mind.

                   Data struggles, anguished... we've never seen him like
                   this before... completely beaten down... finally, he
                   nods. The Borg Queen touches the control again. A
                   sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data.
                   And the Queen kisses him on the mouth.

                   This time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into
                   the emotion of the moment. She pulls back a little,
                   looks at him softly, passionately. Data stares back at
                   her, breathless -- he seems to be completely in her
                   thrall.

 DATA                              In order to access my neural
                             net... you will need to create a
                             positronic interface.
                                     (beat)
                             I will tell you how.

                   OFF the Borg Queen's smile of victory...

 CUT TO: 
 214 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 214 
                   As before. Picard and Geordi work the control in
                   silence for a few moments. The ship is floating in
                   space, now a good distance from Earth.

 GEORDI                              Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

 PICARD                              As they used to say... all systems
                             are go.

                   Geordi works his console...

 215 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 215 
                   Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the
                   ship on either side of the Phoenix, revealing primitive
                   WARP NACELLES tucked inside the craft. The warp
                   nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward
                   on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles
                   should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a STAR
                   TREK starship.

                   This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural
                   design element of our ships.

 216 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 216 
                   As before.

 GEORDI                              The Vulcans should be out there
                             right now. We need to break the
                             warp barrier in the next five
                             minutes if we're going to get
                             their attention.

 PICARD                              Bring the warp core on-line. I'll
                             lay in a heading.

 GEORDI                              The nacelles are charged...
                             nuclear warhead standing by.
                             We're ready to ignite the warp
                             drive.

 PICARD                              Engage.

 217 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 217 
                   The warp nacelles FLARE with power and the ship begins
                   moving forward in space.

 218 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 218 
                   They're SLAMMED BACK into their seats from the massive
                   G-forces.

 GEORDI                              Warp field looks good...
                             structural integrity holding...

                   Picard activates a monitor which begins showing a 
                   digital display of their speed.

 PICARD                                      (off monitor)
                             Speed... twenty thousand
                             kilometers per second.

 219 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 219 
                   The ship is going faster... faster...

 220 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE 220 
                   Troi is standing outside the emergency airlock with the
                   Ensign, who is working the wall panel.

                   The airlock door OPENS after a beat, and Riker, Worf
                   and One Security Guard ENTER. They're exhausted after
                   the pitched battle. Troi smiles at them as they remove
                   their helmets.

 TROI                              I have to admit there was a moment
                             there when --

 RIKER                                      (holds up a hand)
                             Hold that thought.

                   He turns away and then doubles over behind a console
                   and begins vomiting off screen. Worf shrugs.

 WORF                              Strong heart. Weak stomach.

                   A light beat, and then suddenly the entire Bridge GOES
                   DARK -- ALL POWER GONE. Console, monitors, everything.

 RIKER                              Report!

 WORF                              We've lost Bridge control!
 RIKER                              Emergency override!

 WORF                                      (works)
                             Nothing.

 221 INT. BORG HIVE 221 
                   The Borg Queen is floating in the middle of the room,
                   surrounded by Borg consoles and technology. Data is
                   still on the table, with some kind of specialized
                   conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors,
                   which are inactive at the moment. He appears to be
                   caught up in the rapture of his new sensations, and his
                   personal connection to the Borg Queen. All thought of
                   his Starfleet responsibilities are gone.

 DATA                                      (to Queen)
                             I am re-routing Bridge command
                             functions to this location.

                   Data thinks for a moment, and the monitors suddenly
                   COME TO LIFE and the equipment around the Queen HUMS
                   with POWER.

                   Information about critical Enterprise systems flows
                   across the monitor screens -- we might recognize
                   graphics from the Bridge displays. The Borg are now in
                   control.

 BORG QUEEN                              Eliminate their remaining
                             defenses. I will send Borg to
                             assimilate the rest of the crew.

                   Data nods... but then one of the consoles BEEPS.

 DATA                                      (reacts)
                             There is a perimeter alert. A
                             ship has entered sensor range.
 BORG QUEEN                              Vulcan?

 DATA                              No.

                   Data tilts his head and --

 222 A MONITOR 222 
                   shows an exterior space shot. The image rapidly ZOOMS
                   IN on the distant PHOENIX. The ship is racing through
                   space.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (reacts, to Data)
                             Give me helm control.

                   Data nods. Another console lights up. She moves to
                   work it herself...

 223 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 223 
                   As the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse
                   speed.

 224 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 224 
                   As before, Picard is now steering the ship with a 21st
                   century JOYSTICK CONTROL. The ship is moving faster
                   and faster, trembling now, a ROAR building.

 PICARD                              Passing one-half light speed. The
                             starboard nacelle's running a
                             little hot...

 GEORDI                              I'm on it...

                   The CABIN shakes a little.

 GEORDI                              The inertial dampers are having
                             trouble compensating... I don't
                             think Cochrane built this thing
                             for comfort.

 PICARD                              Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five
                             thousand kilometers per second.

                   WHOOSH! A weird DISTORTION passes through the cabin
                   like a wave, then vanishes.

 GEORDI                              There's no temporal shielding in
                             here! We're starting to pick up
                             relativistic effects!

 PICARD                              One minute to warp threshold...

 225 EXT. SPACE 225 
                   The warp ship WHIPS by... and then a moment later, the
                   ENTERPRISE ROARS into view, chasing the tiny ship.

 226 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 226 
                   Geordi glances out the window... does a double-take and
                   looks back up in surprise...

 GEORDI                              Captain, the Enterprise!

 PICARD                                      (taps combadge)
                             Picard to Enterprise.
                                     (beat)
                             Picard to Enterprise -- do you
                             read me?

                   No response.

 PICARD                              Their com system must still be
                             down.

 GEORDI                              Well, I feel a whole lot better
                             with them out there. We may need
                             some help.

 227 INT. BORG HIVE 227 
                   As before, the Queen floating above the helm control
                   console. The warp ship is on the monitor, getting
                   closer.

 DATA                              I have repaired the weapons array.
                             Phasers are on-line.

                   A floating CROSSHAIR appears on the monitor showing the
                   warp ship. The Queen works the console. The crosshair
                   moves, but refuses to lock onto the warp ship. She
                   frowns.

 BORG QUEEN                              The targeting lock isn't working.

                   Data looks puzzled.

 DATA                              I do not understand. The optical
                             data network has been repaired,
                             and all systems are functioning.

                   The Queen works furiously, still can't get the
                   crosshairs to lock onto the ship.

 BORG QUEEN                              Your diagnostics are in error. I
                             need weapons.

 DATA                                      (thinks)
                             The problem must lie in the
                             interface between Starfleet and
                             Borg technology. Your console may
                             not be configured to handle the
                             data flow.
 BORG QUEEN                              Can you configure it?

 DATA                              I believe so.

 BORG QUEEN                              Do it.

                   She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby
                   console... and the restraints holding Data to the table
                   are RELEASED. Two Borg drones move to him... as he
                   stands up and heads for the Queen, the specialized
                   cable still attached to his head...

 228 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 228 
                   closing in on the tiny warp ship. It's like a shark
                   chasing a guppy.

 229 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 229 
                   Ship SHAKING with power and acceleration.

 PICARD                              Approaching light speed...

                   Geordi glances out a side window.

 GEORDI                              They're getting awfully close...
                             what the hell are they doing?
 PICARD                              We're crossing the threshold!

                   The ship is really SHAKING HARD now -- and the
                   compartment is DISTORTING slightly, stretching,
                   everything becoming elongated...

 230 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 230 
                   The ship is STRETCHING in the familiar "rubber band
                   effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but
                   this effect is much slower. It's on the verge of
                   hitting warp speed. The Enterprise still on their
                   tail.

 231 INT. BORG HIVE 231 
                   Data is standing right next to the Queen, and is
                   studying the Borg console intently. Two Borg drones
                   stand nearby, watching closely.

 DATA                              I believe I see the problem.

                   In the blink of an eye:

 -- DATA WHIRLS AROUND AND SLAMS AN ARM INTO ONE OF THE                    BORG DRONES. The drone is knocked off its feet.

                   -- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at
                   Data's head. This is the same Borg with the deadly
                   stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier. The spikes
                   TEAR into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing BLOOD.

                   -- Data reacts in pain. He GRABS the Borg's arm and
                   with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the
                   same time. The Borg FLIES BACKWARD, causing the
                   cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of
                   sparks.

                   -- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill.
                   But Data's too quick for her. With one swift motion,
                   he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across
                   the room.

 232 NEW ANGLE 232 
                   As the spikes on the severed Borg arm PUNCTURE one of
                   the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier. A HUGE
                   EXPLOSION of DEADLY GAS bursts out of the ruptured
                   tank. The WALL of roiling gas sweeps through the
                   entire Borg Hive.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (screams)
                             No!

                   She lunges at Data just as the gas envelopes them!

 233 EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX 233 
                   As it GOES INTO WARP -- it shoots forward and streaks
                   away from the Enterprise!

 234 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 234 
                   As Picard and Geordi are slammed back into their seats
                   and the stars WHIP PAST the windows in the familiar
                   warp effect.

 235 INT. BORG HIVE 235 
                   Data and the Borg Queen tearing and clawing at each 
                   other amongst the spewing gas. The Borg drones try to
                   get away, but they are SWALLOWED by the rush of gas,
                   fall to the deck, twitching in pain.

                   Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck,
                   grappling with each other.

 236 EXT. SPACE - THE WARP SHIP 236 
                   As it STREAKS PAST -- the warp ship flying at top
                   speed.

 237 INT. BORG HIVE 237 
                   Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each
                   other... the gas swirling around their bodies... and as
                   it does, we see the FLESH on their bodies start to
                   LIQUEFY and MELT AWAY in a horrific ooze of blood and
                   skin.

 238 INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT 238 
                   As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably,
                   Warp stars streaking by.

 PICARD                              Bring us about...

                   A beat as Geordi works.

 GEORDI                              Dropping out of warp.

                   Out the front windows, the warp stars STOP... the ship
                   JOLTS slightly... turns to the left... Earth can be
                   seen in the distance.

                   They smile. It's a moment of victory.

 PICARD                              Let's begin the landing procedure.

 239 INT. CARGO BAY/BORG HIVE 239 
                   The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every
                   surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of
                   Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg
                   drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic
                   matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies,
                   leaving only raw mechanical skeletons.

 MOVE TO REVEAL: 
 240 DATA AND THE BORG QUEEN 240 
                   lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a
                   shocking image: all of his human flesh has been
                   STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His
                   metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes
                   are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but
                   the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is
                   stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with
                   no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him
                   before -- raw and mechanistic.

                   Data rolls over... still locked around him is the
                   MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic
                   spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading
                   off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the
                   very top of the spine.

                   Data throws off the grotesque form. The Borg Queen
                   carcass writhes and claws at the air. She speaks in a
                   flat, mechanical voice.

 BORG QUEEN                                      (fritzed)
                             Data...

                   Data reaches out with one hand... grabs the metal
                   spinal column just below the brain stem... and SNAPS IT
                   IN TWO. The blinking brain stem FRITZES OUT.

 241 INT. CORRIDOR 241 
                   Two Borg Drones moving down the hall suddenly stop...
                   twitch... the blinkies on their bodies GO OUT... and
                   they both FALL OVER DEAD. Their connection to their
                   Queen severed.

 242 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE 242 
                   Another Borg Drone reacts... lights out... slumps over
 DEAD. 
 243 INT. BORG HIVE 243 
                   Data releases the remains of the dead Borg Queen. He
                   leans back a little, as though exhausted by his
                   remarkable experience. CAMERA PULLS BACK, emphasizing
                   the loneliness of this smoking, scorched android
                   sitting alone in the ruins of the Borg Hive...

 CUT TO: 
 244 EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY 244 
                   The missile doors now open, the ground badly scorched
                   from the launch. Scrimm and his militia guards are
                   sitting on the ground, while Lange and the other
                   Starfleet N.D. keep a watchful eye on them. Cochrane
                   is sitting against a rock, while Beverly checks him
                   over. Ruby is pacing, lost in thought...

 PICARD'S VOICE                              Isn't anyone going to say welcome
                             back?

                   Everyone looks up to see --

 245 PICARD AND GEORDI 245 
                   standing a few feet away, tired but triumphant.

 BEVERLY                              Did it work?

                   Picard nods. Beverly, Lange and the N.D. look
                   relieved. Ruby takes a few steps toward Picard.

 246 COCHRANE 246 
                   smiles up at Geordi.

 COCHRANE                              Mister La Forge... now I'd like to
                             shake your hand.

                   Geordi smiles and walks over to him.

 247 PICARD AND RUBY 247 
                   stop a few feet away from each other, their eyes
                   locked. They drink in sight of each other...
                   there's an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words.
                   She smiles... he smiles back. A satisfying moment.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              Captain's log, March 3rd, 2063.
                             The voyage of the Phoenix was a
                             success... again.

 CUT TO: 
 248 EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - NIGHT 248 
                   Townspeople along the Main Street. A sense of
                   urgency -- something's going on.

 PICARD (V.O.)                              And it appears the Vulcan ship has
                             detected the warp signature and is
                             now on its way to Earth.

                   Suddenly something in the night sky catches their
                   attention. A BRIGHT LIGHT is moving down towards the
                   city. We now realize this is what people are reacting
                   to...

 249 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 249 
                   Just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the
                   massive VULCAN SCOUT SHIP SETTLING down onto the
                   ground. Dust flying everywhere. Windmill blades
                   spinning wildly from the exhaust.

 250 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 250 
                   squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's
                   happening...

 251 NEW ANGLE - ON A HILLTOP 251 
                   A good distance away, but with a good view of the
                   entire scene. Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi and Geordi
                   watching from a distance as the Vulcan ship LANDS.

 252 JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN 252                    Picard, Ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier Zephram
                   Cochrane watching the landing. People from town are
                   surging around them. Everyone is shocked and amazed at
                   what they're seeing. Picard watches with satisfaction --
                   this is the moment he's been waiting for.

                   Cochrane and Ruby are particularly awestruck.

 253 THE VULCAN SHIP 253 
                   settles, engines whining down... dust settling.
 254 PICARD 254 
                   moves to Cochrane, takes him gently by the arm.

 PICARD                              Doctor Cochrane... this is your
                             moment.

                   Cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple
                   with the moment.

 COCHRANE                              My God... they're really from
                             another world?

 PICARD                              That's right. And they're going
                             to want to meet the man who flew
                             that warp ship.

                   Cochrane looks at him.

 COCHRANE                              And that's supposed to be me...

 PICARD                              Zephram, you had the vision to
                             build that ship when no one else
                             on this planet could see beyond
                             their own problems.
                                     (beat)
                             You flew that ship... all I did
                             was push a few buttons.

                   Cochrane looks at him for a moment... takes a breath,
                   nods...

 COCHRANE                              All right.
                                     (beat)
                             And don't worry -- I'll keep your
                             secret.

                   They hear a mechanical WHIRR and a HISS of air.

 255 NEW ANGLE 255 
                   as a HATCH opens on the Vulcan ship. The townspeople
                   behind them react with shock and fear... a few people
                   take a step back. Picard looks at Cochrane, who
                   hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep
                   breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. A man
                   alone about to change the course of human history.

                   Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around
                   him... and he puts his arm around her.

 256 HILLTOP 256 
                   As the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment...
                   they glance at each other with excitement as they watch
                   history unfold...

 257 VULCAN SHIP 257 
                   Cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the
                   hatch swings completely open... light streams out into
                   the night air... and THREE HOODED, ROBED FIGURES
                   EMERGE. They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment
                   frozen in time.

 258 THE TOWNSPEOPLE 258 
                   watching in awe...

 259 PICARD AND RUBY 259 
                   watching...

 260 THE LEAD VULCAN 260 
                   pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted
                   eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that
                   austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his
                   race. He steps forward to greet Cochrane... raises his
                   hand as if to wave.

                   Cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave
                   in return...

                   But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic
                   Vulcan greeting.

 VULCAN                              Live Long and Prosper.

                   Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-sign...but
                   can't quite do the awkward finger-split.

 COCHRANE                              Um... thanks.

                   The Vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him. The very first
                   Alien-Human relationship is underway...

 261 PICARD AND RUBY 261 
                   are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the
                   scene unfold...

 262 HILLTOP 262 
                   Our heroes share a glance with each other and smile,
                   Riker taps his combadge.

 RIKER                              Riker to Enterprise. Five to beam
                             up.

                   The crew DEMATERIALIZES...

 263 PICARD AND RUBY 263 
                   have now moved away from the crowd... no one paying
                   attention to them. The bright lights from the Vulcan
                   ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette. Picard turns
                   to Ruby. It's the moment he's been dreading. This is
                   goodbye. She looks at him.

 RUBY                              You're leaving, aren't you?

 PICARD                              I have to...

 RUBY                              Where? And don't tell me San
                             Francisco...

 PICARD                              No. It's a lot further than that.

 RUBY                              It's the future, isn't it? Just
                             like you told Scrimm.
                                     (beat)
                             I knew you weren't from around
                             here.

 PICARD                                      (with humor)
                             No... I'm from France.

 RUBY                              I don't care if you're from France
                             or Venus... just take me with you.

 PICARD                              That's impossible.

 RUBY                              Why?

 PICARD                              This may be hard for you to
                             understand... but I'm duty-bound
                             not to interfere with you, or
                             anyone else here... any more than
                             is absolutely necessary.

 RUBY                              You've been interfering with my
                             life ever since I met you.
                                     (with meaning)
                             Don't stop now.

                   Picard struggles... he doesn't want to do this, but
                   he's torn between his heart and his duty.

 PICARD                              Ruby... I'm sorry.
                                     (remembering his words
                                      to Beverly)
                             But our fates lie along different
                             paths.

                   A long, difficult moment... then he lets her go...
                   turns and starts walking off into the night. She
                   stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her
                   eyes...

                   Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                              Picard to Enterprise. One to...

                   He stops where he is.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Riker here. Captain, we didn't
                             get your whole transmission.

                   Picard turns, looks back at Ruby. Their eyes meet...
                   and he makes the decision.

 PICARD                              To hell with fate.

 RIKER'S COM VOICE                              Say again, Captain?

                   He starts walking towards her. She sees him coming...
                   starts running to him. She throws herself into his
                   arms and he holds her close. They kiss. A magical
                   moment, then...

 PICARD                              Enterprise. Two to beam up.

                   They DEMATERIALIZE holding each other tight...

 264 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 264 
                   moving out of Earth orbit...

 265 INT. BRIDGE 265 
                   Riker, Worf, Troi, N.D.s. Picard ENTERS with Ruby.
                   Everyone reacts to seeing her there. Ruby stays in the
                   Turbolift, staring around the Bridge in amazement.
                   Picard takes her hand and leads her out onto the
                   Bridge.

 PICARD                              How's Mister Data?

                   Riker glances at Ruby uneasily.

 RIKER                              He's in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
                             says he can be repaired... but we
                             have to wait until we...

                   He glances at Ruby again, awkward. But Picard finishes
                   his thought.

 PICARD                              Return to our own time?

 RIKER                              Yes, sir.

 PICARD                              Then make it so. Have you
                             determined how to recreate the
                             temporal vortex?

                   Picard sits in his chair. Riker hesitates.

 RIKER                              Yes, sir. But Captain... are
                             we... all going back?

 PICARD                              Unless you'd like to stay.
 RIKER                              No, sir.

                   Ruby stands stock-still, staring at Worf. Worf looks
                   up at her with a Klingon smile -- teeth and all.

                   Ruby manages a weak smile in return, then moves off to
                   stand next to Picard.

 RIKER                              Bridge to Engineering. Mister La
                             Forge... initiate the temporal
                             vortex.

 266 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 266 
                   moving through space... and then the TEMPORAL VORTEX
                   forms directly ahead of it, as seen before. The ship
                   ENTERS the vortex...

 267 EXT. SPACE - THE 24TH CENTURY 267 
                   The Enterprise EXITS the VORTEX and into Earth orbit.

 268 INT. BRIDGE 268 
                   As before.

 WORF                              Incoming transmission from
                             Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.

 PICARD                              Onscreen.

 269 INCLUDE VIEWER 269 
                   Admiral Hayes appears.

 PICARD                              Admiral... what's the status of
                             the Borg fleet?

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              It's been destroyed. The Borg
                             threat is over.
                                     (beat)
                             Are you all right? The Enterprise
                             disappeared from our sensors for
                             a moment.

 PICARD                              We're fine, sir. It will take
                             some... time to explain.

 ADMIRAL HAYES                              I look forward to reading your
                             report.

                   The transmission ends. Ruby turns to Picard with
                   amazement.

 RUBY                              That makes two of us.

                   Picard gives her a gentle smile. OFF the moment...

 CUT TO: 
 270 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE 270 
                   The great ship entering a Starfleet SPACE DOCK.

 271 INT. BORG HIVE/ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM 271                    Geordi is directing a work crew of a dozen engineers,
                   as they clean up the room and repair the damage.

 GEORDI                                      (to a couple of N.D.s)
                             No, no -- we'll have to rip out
                             this entire bulkhead. We'll need
                             new bracing members for the deck
                             above and below.

                   The N.D.s move off, making notes on their PADDS.
                   Geordi turns and sees Data standing in the doorway.
                   He's now been fully restored to his original android
                   self.

 GEORDI                              Data...

                   Geordi moves to him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

 GEORDI                              You look good as new.

 DATA                              You could say that I'm back to my
                             old self.

 GEORDI                              That's great.

                   Geordi's smile fades a little as Data walks into the
                   room.

 DATA                              Her remains... are they still
                             here?

                   Geordi points over to a corner, where some N.D.s are
                   about to close a storage container. Data walks over.
                   Geordi goes with him. The N.D.s move aside, and Data
                   looks down into the storage container. The broken,
                   mangles pieces of machinery are all that's left of the
                   Borg Queen.

 GEORDI                              I'm sending them to the Daystrom
                             Institute for analysis.

                   Data stares down at the remains with a haunted look.

 DATA                              I never realized how powerful an
                             emotion temptation could be.

 GEORDI                              Temptation? You said in your
                             report it was all a ruse... you
                             were manipulating her.

                   A quiet beat.

 DATA                              She was... a unique lifeform. In
                             her own way... nearly perfect.

                   Geordi smiles a little.

 GEORDI                                      (joking)
                             It almost sounds like you miss
                             her.

                   Data looks up at him -- his expression unreadable.
                   Geordi's smile fades. Data reaches out, closes the lid
                   on the storage container, turns and walks out of the
                   room. Geordi watches him go, left to wonder what Data
                   is really feeling.

 CUT TO: 
 272 EXT. MONTANA - HILLTOP - DAY 272                    Picard and Ruby walk up the familiar hilltop, and when
                   they reach the crest, we reveal...

 273 A MOMENT 273 
                   A large memorial cordoned off by a chain. A PLAQUE on
                   the monument reads "On this spot, Man and Vulcan met
                   for the first time... and changed the course of
                   history. March 3rd, 2063."

 274 PICARD AND RUBY 274 
                   step into view. They stare at the sculpture for a
                   moment.

 PICARD                              Welcome home.

 275 WIDE SHOT 275 
                   Picard, Ruby and the monument are at the gates of
                   RESURRECTION CITY as it is in the 23rd century. This
                   is the place where man first reached out to the stars,
                   and the architecture has a distinctive uplifting
                   feeling -- spires reaching up toward the sky.
                   Shuttlecraft and aircars are taking off and landing.
                   The tiny Western town is now a thriving, futuristic
 METROPOLIS. 
                   As Picard and Ruby walk towards the city hand-in-
                   hand...

 FADE IN: 
 1 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 1 
                   A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT 
                   appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small 
                   and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, 
                   but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...

 2 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 2 
                   A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware 
                   that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of 
                   wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the 
                   sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their
                   conversation...and we can see that the two men are 
                   SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.

 CHEKOV                                      (points to sky)
                             There he is -- there, to the 
                             South!

 SCOTTY                                      (peers upward)
                             What are ye, blind? That's a 
                             bird.

                   As they stare up at the sky...

 3 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 3 
                   The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and 
                   we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it 
                   is tumbling directly toward the camera...

 4 EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY 4 
                   As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.

 SCOTTY                                      (concerned)
                             Repelling the Crystalline 
                             Trench... rafting down lava 
                             flows... orbital skydiving. it's 
                             like the man is running a bloody 
                             decathlon across the galaxy.

                   Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.

 CHEKOV                                      (re: sound)
                             That should be him now. I think 
                             he's just crossed the sound 
                             barrier.

                   They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.

 5 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 5 
                   The bottle gets CLOSER...

 6 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6 
                   A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS 
                   in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is 
                   charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of
                   it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack 
                   and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man 
                   removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He 
                   smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
                   roller-coaster.

 KIRK                              Right on target! I jump out over 
                             the Arabian Peninsula... and I end 
                             up here, right on the dime.

                   Kirk gets to his feet.

 CHEKOV                              Actually, Captain, your precise 
                             target area was thirty-five 
                             meters...
                                     (points)
                             That way.
 KIRK                              Thanks for pointing that out.

                   Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden 
                   pain in his back.

 KIRK                              Oh...

 SCOTTY                              I've warned ye about that back of 
                             yours. You should have a doctor 
                             take a look at it.

                   Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his 
                   harness.

 6A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 6A 
                   The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see 
                   that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. 
                   Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...

 6B EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6B                    Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.

 KIRK                              Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
                             elliptical jump. That's where you 
                             jump out over Northern China, and 
                             make three complete orbits before 
                             you start re-entry...

 CHEKOV                              Captain. Perhaps you have 
                             forgotten that tomorrow is the 
                             christening ceremony.

                   This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
                   hesitation and irritation cross his face.

 KIRK                              I'm not going.
                                     (beat) 
                             Scotty, help me with this chute.

 SCOTTY                              What do you mean, you're not 
                             going? We promised.

 KIRK                              When I retired, I swore I'd never 
                             set foot on a starship again, and 
                             I meant it.

 CHEKOV                              Captain...

 KIRK                                      (firm)
                             I don't want to hear anymore about 
                             it. I'm not going, and that's 
                             final.

 7 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7 
                   The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a 
                   Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its 
                   dock in orbit around Earth.

 7A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7A 
                   FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they 
                   spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull: 
 U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B. 
 8 ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW 8 
                   A large picture window overlooking the starship in its 
                   berth. The window is filled with people in Starfleet 
                   uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but 
                   we hear nothing).

 8A INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I) 8A                    The people are still applauding and we can see that 
                   they are looking out over the ship in its berth.

 8B EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I) 8B 
                   The great ship sits in spacedock.

 9 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 9 
                   CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to 
                   reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines 
                   into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL -
                   that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
                   CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The 
                   camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is 
                   worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS 
                   clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated 
                   with the camera, the others using PADDS to make 
                   notations.

                   Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of 
                   the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and 
                   the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the
                   Bridge.

 JOURNALISTS                                      (overlapping)
                             Captain Kirk, how does it feel 
                             to be back on the Enterprise 
                             Bridge... Captain, can I have a 
                             Minute... Captain Scott, do you 
                             have any comment on... Commander
                             Chekov... etc.

                   CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, excuse me...there will 
                             be plenty of time for questions
                             later...

                   The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to 
                   get a good angle.

 HARRIMAN                                      (continuing, to all)
                             I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd 
                             like to welcome you all aboard.

 KIRK                              It's our pleasure.

                   Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his 
                   first command and he takes it very seriously.

 HARRIMAN                              I just want you to know how 
                             excited we all are to have a group 
                             of living legends with us on our 
                             maiden voyage. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I remember reading about your 
                             missions when I was in grade 
                             school.

                   The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him 
                   a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he 
                   didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a
                   little smile, lets it roll off. 
 KIRK                              Well... may we have a look around?

 HARRIMAN                              Please... please.

                   Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to 
                   her.

 CHEKOV                              Demora!

                   Chekov moves off.

 JOURNALIST                                      (breezy)
                             So, Captain... this is the first 
                             Starship Enterprise in thirty 
                             years without James T. Kirk in 
                             command. How do you feel about 
                             that?

                   The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's 
                   eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this 
                   Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about 
                   it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
 KIRK                              Just fine. I'm glad to be here to 
                             send her on her way...

                   He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs 
                   him.

 JOURNALIST                              What have you been doing since you 
                             retired?

 KIRK                              I've been... keeping busy.

                   At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid-
                   twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.

 CHEKOV                                      (to Kirk)
                             Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you 
                             to meet the Helmsman of the
                             Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu --
                             Captain James Kirk.

 DEMORA                              It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. 
                             My father's told me some...
                             interesting stories about you.

                   Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her 
                   in amazement.

 KIRK                              Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your 
                             father?

 DEMORA                              Yes, sir.

 CHEKOV                              You met her once before, but she 
                             was...

                   Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short 
                   height.

 KIRK                              But that wasn't so long ago... it 
                             couldn't have been more than...

 CHEKOV                              Twelve years, sir.

 KIRK                              Yes... well... congratulations, 
                             Ensign. It wouldn't be the 
                             Enterprise without a Sulu at the 
                             helm.

 DEMORA                              Thank you, sir. 
                                      (to Chekov) 
                             Let me show you the new inertial 
                             guidance system.

                   Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them 
                   for a long beat. The expression on his face changes 
                   from shock to sadness... Something is clearly 
                   bothering him. 

                   Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.

 SCOTTY                                      (to Kirk)
                             Damn fine ship if you ask me...

                   But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as 
                   she moves to the Helmsman's position.

 KIRK                              You know, Scotty... it amazes me.

 SCOTTY                              And what would that be, sir?

 KIRK                              Sulu. When did he find the time 
                             for a family?

 SCOTTY                              It's like you always said -- if 
                             something's important enough, you 
                             make the time.

                   Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...

 SCOTTY                              So... that's why you've been 
                             running around the galaxy like an
                             eighteen-year-old. Finding 
                             retirement a little lonely, are we?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 KIRK                              With that kind of tact, I'm glad 
                             you're an engineer and not a
                             psychiatrist.

                   Harriman interrupts.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll 
                             take your seats.

 KIRK                              Oh... of course.

 10 NEW ANGLE 10 
                   Revealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged 
                   to one side.

                   Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The 
                   Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the 
                   Bridge. Harriman moves to the command chair and the 
                   rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to all)
                             Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft 
                             thrusters ahead one quarter, port 
                             and starboard at station keeping. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if 
                             you would give the order to get 
                             underway.

 KIRK                              No... no. Thank you.

 HARRIMAN                              Please, I insist.

                   All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice. He stands 
                   uncomfortably. There is a moment of anticipation.

 KIRK                                      (to all)
                             Take us out.

                   Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE. Kirk sits down in 
                   acute embarrassment and  annoyance.

 CHEKOV                                      (sotto)
                             Very good, sir.

 SCOTTY                                      (sotto)
                             Brought a tear to my eye.

 CUT TO: 11 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 11 
                   The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads 
                   out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.

 12 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 12 
                   A short time later. Harriman turns to his guests.

 HARRIMAN                              Well... we've just cleared the 
                             asteroid belt. Our course will 
                             take us out beyond Pluto and then 
                             back to spacedock. Just a quick 
                             run around the block. 
                                     (beat) 
                             If we have time, we'll conduct a 
                             few tests of the warp --

                   Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP. 
                   The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.

 COM OFFICER                                      (to Harriman)
                             We're picking up a distress call, 
                             Captain.

                   This grabs everyone's attention.

 HARRIMAN                              On speakers.

                   We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked 
                   and urgent.

 COM VOICE                                      (fritzed)
                             This is the transport ship Lakul. 
                             We're caught in some kind of
                             energy distortion. We can't break 
                             free... need immediate help... 
                             It' tearing us --

                   The voice is drowned out by STATIC. The SCIENCE 
                   OFFICER checks something on his console. The 
                   Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and 
                   pans it around to capture the action.

 SCIENCE OFFICER                              The Lakul is one of two ships 
                             transporting El-Aurian refugees to 
                             Earth.

                   Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this 
                   unexpected turn of  events. Kirk watches him intently. 
                   Harriman clears his throat, then turns to Demora.

 HARRIMAN                              Can you locate them?

 DEMORA                              The ships are bearing at three one
                             zero mark two one five. Distance:
                             Three light years.

 HARRIMAN                              Signal the closest starship. 
                             We're in no condition to mount a 
                             rescue... We don't even have a 
                             full crew aboard.

                   The NAVIGATOR checks his console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're the only one in range, sir.

                   The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he 
                   shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk 
                   is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. 
                   Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his 
                   jacket a bit.

 HARRIMAN                              Well, then... I guess it's up to 
                             us. 
                                      (to Demora) 
                             Helm, lay in an intercept course 
                             and engage at maximum warp.

                   Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the 
                   action - his instincts taking over. Scotty shoots him 
                   a side-long glance.

 SCOTTY                              Is there something wrong with your 
                             chair, Captain?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 13 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 13 
                   The ship snaps into warp.
 14 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 14 
                   A few minutes later. Demora is watching her console.

 DEMORA                              We're within visual range of the 
                             energy distortion, Captain.

 HARRIMAN                              On screen.

 15 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15 
                   Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY 
                   directly ahead of the Enterprise-B. 

                   Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.

 CHEKOV                              What the hell is that?

 DEMORA                                      (off console)
                             I've found the transport ships.

 15A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15A 
                   The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped 
                   like insects in the violent torrent of energy. The 
                   ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large 
                   TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY.

 DEMORA                                      (cont'd)
                             Their hulls are starting to buckle 
                             under the stress -- they won't 
                             survive much longer.

                   The ship suddenly SHAKES. The Navigator works his 
                   console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're encountering severe 
                             gravimetric distortions from the 
                             energy ribbon.

 HARRIMAN                              We'll have to keep our distance...
                             we don't want to get pulled in
                             too...

                   Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out 
                   what to do. Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him 
                   the answer is obvious. He blurts out the answer --

 KIRK                              Tractor beam...

                   Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't 
                   Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up.  Harriman glances at Kirk.

 HARRIMAN                              We don't have a tractor beam.

 KIRK                              You left spacedock without a 
                             tractor beam?

 HARRIMAN                              It won't be installed until 
                             Tuesday. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Ensign Sulu... try generating a 
                             subspace field around the ships. 
                             That might break them free.

 DEMORA                              Aye, sir.

                   When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly 
                   and mouths the word "no" under his breath. He knows 
                   that won't work.

 DEMORA                                      (continuing; shakes her 
                                      head)
                             There's too much quantum 
                             interference, Captain.

                   Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another
                   solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in 
                   command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared. 
                   It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in 
                   On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair --
                   but he restrains himself.

 HARRIMAN                              What about... venting plasma from 
                             the warp nacelles? That might 
                             disrupt the ribbon's hold on the 
                             ships.

 NAVIGATOR                              Aye, sir.. releasing drive 
                             plasma...

                   A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the 
                   journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him 
                   a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he 
                   knows this is not the right course of action.

 NAVIGATOR                                      (continuing)
                             It's not having any effect, sir. 
                             I think --
 DEMORA                              Sir! The starboard vessel's hull 
                             is collapsing --
 15B INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15B 
                   Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed 
                   by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES. The 
                   other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. 
                   Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.

 CHEKOV                              How many people were aboard 
                             that ship?

 DEMORA                              Two hundred sixty-five.

                   Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by 
                   the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at 
                   a genuine loss as to what to do next.

 DEMORA                                      (urgent)
                             The Lakul's hull integrity is down 
                             to twelve percent, sir.

                   Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet 
                   during this entire sequence only through great effort 
                   and out of deference to the young Captain. This is a 
                   delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look 
                   incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.

 HARRIMAN                              Captain Kirk... I would appreciate 
                             any... suggestions you might have.

                   Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. 
                   He moves down to stand next to Harriman.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             First -- move us within 
                             transporter range and beam those 
                             people to the Enterprise.

                   Harriman looks at him with surprise.

 HARRIMAN                              What about the gravimetric 
                             distortions? They'll tear us 
                             apart...

 KIRK                                      (gently)
                             Risk is part of the game if you 
                             want to sit in that chair.

                   Kirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles 
                   down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.

 HARRIMAN                              Helm, close to within transporter 
                             range.

                   Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the 
                   light on them  all.

 KIRK                              And second -- turn that damned 
                             thing off.

                   The cameraman turns OFF the light.

 CUT TO: 
 16 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 16 
                   The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. 
                   The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just 
                   missing it.

 17 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 17 
                   As before.

 DEMORA                              We're within range, sir.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to lieutenant)
                             Beam them directly to Sickbay.

 CHEKOV                                      (concerned)
                             How big's your medical staff?

 HARRIMAN                                      (embarrassed)
                             The medical staff... doesn't
                             arrive until Tuesday.

                   Chekov turns to the two journalists.

 CHEKOV                              You and you. You've just become 
                             nurses. Let's go.

                   Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.
 DEMORA                              Main Engineering reports 
                             fluctuations in the warp plasma 
                             relays.

 SCOTTY                              By-pass the relays and go to 
                             auxiliary systems.

                   The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console.

 LIEUTENANT                              Sir, I'm having trouble locking 
                             onto them. They appear to be...
                             in some sort of... temporal flux.

                   Kirk turns to Scotty.

 KIRK                              Scotty?

                   Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter 
                   console.

 SCOTTY                              What the hell...

                   Kirk moves to him.

 SCOTTY                              Their life signs are... are
                             phasing in and out of our 
                             space-time continuum.

 KIRK                              Phasing? To where?

                   Scotty begins to work.

 NAVIGATOR                              Sir! Their hull's collapsing!

 18 EXT. SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I) 18 
                   The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.

 19 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 19 
                   All eyes on Scotty.

 SCOTTY                              I got forty-seven of them...
                                     (beat, grim) 
                             ... out of one hundred fifty.

                   Suddenly the ship is rocked violently. KLAXONS and 
                   alarms start to wail and the lights FLICKER on and off. 
                   BULKHEAD EXPLODES, sending metal fragments screaming 
                   across the Bridge and KILLING the Navigator. Scotty 
                   quickly takes over the dead man's console.

 KIRK                              Report!

 DEMORA                              We're caught in a gravimetric 
                             field emanating from the trailing 
                             edge of the ribbon.

              20   EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B & RIBBON (VFX-I)                   20

                   The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the
                   ribbon, but cannot break away. It is clearly being 
                   pulled along, out of control. Tendrils leap up from the
                   ribbon, lashing against the ship.

 21 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY 21 
                   The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul. 
                   They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN  race -- humanoid 
                   and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are 
                   in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, 
                   staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, 
                   unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to 
                   themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from 
                   person to person trying to get control of the 
                   situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about. 
                   Chekov has a tricorder.

 SURVIVORS                                      (incoherent, overlapping)
                             The colors are touching me... I'm 
                             caught in the glass... Help me...
                             I can see the seconds... Over 
                             here... etc

 CHEKOV                              It will be all right. We're going 
                             to take care of you.

                   He looks at the tricorder.

 CHEKOV                                      (off tricorder)
                             Only minor injuries so far...
                                     (beat) 
                             But it looks like they're all
                             suffering from some kind of
                             neural shock.

                   One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed 
                   with a dazed look on his face. He has a nasty-looking 
                   wound on one side of his face. (We will later learn 
                   that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.)

                   The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly 
                   Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great 
                   Strength -- and pulls him close. Soran's eyes are 
                   suddenly wild, crazed.

 SORAN                              Why...why?

 JOURNALIST                              It's all right... you're safe...
                             you're on the Enterprise.

 SORAN                              No... I have to go... I have to 
                             get back... You don't understand! 
                             Let me go!

                   Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he 
                   can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a 
                   hypospray and Soran falls unconscious.

 JOURNALIST                              What was he talking about?

                   Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles 
                   nearby. Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her 
                   before she falls.

 CHEKOV                              Easy there...

                   The woman turns around and we see her face for the 
                   first time -- it's GUINAN. She seems dazed and 
                   confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.

 CHEKOV                              It's going to be okay. Here, just 
                             lie down.

                   As he guides Guinan onto a table...

 22 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE (VFX-I) 22 
                   Energy ribbon on viewscreen.

 DEMORA                              Inertial dampers failing.

 SCOTTY                              Engines not responding!

                   Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one 
                   hand. His face pales.

 HARRIMAN                                      (quiet)
                             I didn't expect to die my first 
                             day on the job.

                   Kirk tries to buck up the young captain.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             The first thing you learn as 
                             Captain is how to cheat death. 
                                     (beat, then louder) 
                             Scotty?

 SCOTTY                                      (outraged)
                             There's just no way to disrupt a 
                             gravimetric field of this 
                             magnitude!

 DEMORA                              Hull integrity failing.

                   Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment.

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             But I do have a theory...

 KIRK                              I thought you might.

 SCOTTY                              An anti-matter discharge directly 
                             ahead... it might disrupt the 
                             field long enough for us to break 
                             away.

 KIRK                              A photon torpedo?

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 KIRK                                      (quickly, to Demora)
                             Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire 
                             on my command.

                   Demora turns to him.

 DEMORA                              Captain... we don't have any 
                             torpedoes.

                   Kirk glances at Harriman.

 KIRK                              Don't tell me... Tuesday.

                   Harriman nods, a little embarrassed. The SHAKING gets 
                   worse.

 SCOTTY                              Captain, it may be possible to 
                             simulate a torpedo blast using a
                             resonance burst from the main 
                             deflector dish.

 KIRK                                      (onto the idea)
                             Where are the deflector relays?

 DEMORA                              Deck fifteen, section twenty-one
                             alpha

 HARRIMAN                                      (to Kirk)
                             I'll go. You have the Bridge.

                   Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment 
                   as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship 
                   and sit in the Captain's chair one more time. But he 
                   pulls himself back before Harriman can exit.

 KIRK                              No... a Captain's place is on the 
                             Bridge of his ship. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I'll take care of it.

                   Harriman nods in acknowledgement. Kirk heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 KIRK                                      (on the move, to Scotty)
                             Keep her together until I get 
                             back.

 SCOTTY                                      (matter of fact)
                             I always do.

                   Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut...

                   A small control room with a few consoles. Kirk rushes 
                   in and rips off one of the large wall panels. He 
                   quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry...

 SCOTTY                              Captain, I don't know how much 
                             longer I can hold her together!

                   Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed.

 KIRK                              That's it. Go!

                   A large BURST 0F ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector 
                   dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship. There is an 
                   immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon, which 
                   roils and fluctuates in response.

                   energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship.

                   scrambles back into position.

                                     (beat) 
                             Captain Kirk, please respond.

                   Still no response. Scotty's face falls.

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing, to Demora)
                             Have Chekov meet me on deck
                             fifteen.

                   Harriman, very concerned, gets up and follows Scotty. 
                   They EXIT to the Turbolift.

 CUT TO: 
 34 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR 34 
                   Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor. They round
                   a bend... and then stop short. They react to 
                   something ahead of them...

 35 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 35 
                   Revealing that the corridor ahead of them is GONE. A 
                   jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and OPEN SPACE 
                   can be seen beyond the twisted metal. 

                   A FORCEFIELD flickers on and off, holding the vacuum of 
                   space at bay.

                   Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a 
                   moment. Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind 
                   them. He stops and reacts.

 CHEKOV                              My God...
                                     (beat) 
                             Was anyone in there?

                   A long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space.

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 36 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 36 
                   A huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering 
                   section, looking like an open wound. Scotty, Chekov,
                   and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small 
                   Corridor, looking out into space...

 37 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE 37 
                   A short time later. Scotty, Harriman and Chekov are 
                   listening to Demora, who is working the Helm console.

 DEMORA                              I've checked the entire ship and 
                             the surrounding space. there's 
                             no sign of him.

                   A silent moment. Chekov looks to Scotty, hoping to 
                   hear some sort of miracle. Scotty takes a moment
                   looks at the empty command chair. Then he shakes his 
                   head. A long beat as everyone is forced to accept this
                   terrible truth.

 SCOTTY                                      (quiet)
                             Just a quick... run around the 
                             block.

 CHEKOV                              I never thought it would end like 
                             this...

 SCOTTY                              All things must end, Mr. Chekov.

                   Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge.

 HARRIMAN                              Let's go home.

                   Harriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes 
                   command of his ship.

                   Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look. Off the 
                   reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone 
                   very dear to them both...

 CUT TO: 
 38 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 38 
                   The crippled ship turns and heads away...

 FADE TO BLACK. 
 SUPER: SEVENTY-EIGHT YEARS LATER... 
 39 CLOSE ON A HALYARD 39 
                   as a FLAG is quickly hoisted to the top of a mast. The 
                   flag reaches the top and is then caught by the wind -- 
                   the blue and white banner of the United Federation of 
                   Planets waves in the breeze.

 MOVE TO REVEAL THE LOCATION 
 40 EXT. SAILING VESSEL - DAY 40 
                   A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about 
                   the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the 
                   water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we 
                   can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters.

 41 ON THE MAIN DECK 41 
                   Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the 
                   assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in 
                   full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with 
                   cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at 
                   attention... the wind whistles through the rigging...
                   the timbers creak...

                   Picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally  he
                   nods to Riker.

 RIKER                              Bring out the prisoner!

                   A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL.

 42 ON A HATCH 42 
                   as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is 
                   shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold 
                   him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain. 
                   The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at 
                   him closely.
 PICARD                              Mister Worf... I always knew this 
                             day would come. Are you prepared 
                             to face the charges?

                   Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.

 TROI                              Answer him!

 WORF                              I am prepared.

                   Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, 
                   rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and 
                   begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes 
                   Worf's shackles.

 RIKER                              "We, the officers and crew of the 
                             U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound 
                             mind and judgment, hereby make 
                             the following charges against 
                             Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did 
                             knowingly and willfully perform 
                             above and beyond the call of duty 
                             on countless occasions. Two. 
                             That he has been a good and solid 
                             officer on this ship for one score 
                             less twelve years. And Three. 
                             Most seriously... that he has 
                             earned the respect and admiration 
                             of the entire crew."

                   Riker puts away the scroll

 PICARD                              There can be only one punishment 
                             for such crimes...
                                     (beat) 
                             I hereby promote you to the rank 
                             of Lieutenant Commander, with all 
                             the rights and privileges thereto. 
                             And may God have mercy on your 
                             soul.

                   Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and
                   shakes his hand.

 PICARD                                      (cont'd)
                             Congratulations, Commander.

 WORF                                      (smiles)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then 
                   Riker steps in.

 RIKER                              Extend the plank!!

                   Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
                   and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is 
                   being pushed out over the water.

 CREWMEMBERS                              Into the sea with him... feed him 
                             to the sharks... walk the 
                             plank... etc.

                   Picard gives Riker a questioning look.

 PICARD                              Don't you think you're taking this 
                             a little too far, Number One?

 RIKER                              When we went to ancient Rome for 
                             Deanna's promotion, we threw her 
                             to the lions, remember?

                   Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of 
                   tea, but he'll go along with it.

                   Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting 
                   patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is 
                   put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike 
                   until Worf is nearly at the end.

                   Worf finally stops and turns around.

 WORF                                      (a shout)
 WAIT!! 
                   Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over 
                   the side at the water below.

 WORF                                      (a little embarrassed)
                             I can't swim.

 LA FORGE                                      (calmly, to Worf)
                             The Holodeck safety program is 
                             engaged... The computer won't let 
                             you drown.

 BEVERLY                              But the sharks are quite 
                             convincing.

                   Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
                   SEA  with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS. 
                   Reveal DATA, who is standing near the side rail, 
                   looking a little confused at the reaction.

 DATA                                      (to Beverly)
                             Doctor, I must confess I am 
                             uncertain as to why pushing 
                             someone into freezing, shark-
                             infested water is amusing.
 BEVERLY                              It's all done in good fun, Data. 
                             Get in the spirit of things.

 DATA                              Ah.

                   Data thinks a moment, then he LIFTS Beverly with one 
                   hand and hold her over the rail.

 BEVERLY                              Data...Data -- !

                   Data lets go and Beverly PLUMMETS into the ocean. Data 
                   looks around -- no one is laughing. They all look a 
                   little surprised.

 GEORDI                              Data. that wasn't funny.

                   Data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's 
                   more confused than ever.

 43 PICARD AND RIKER 43 
                   are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet Beverly 
                   comes up on deck.

 PICARD                              Well, now that we're all aboard...
                                     (beat, then smiles) 
                             Number One, bring the ship before 
                             the wind. 
                                     (savoring the moment) 
                             Let's see what's out there.

 RIKER                              Aye, aye, sir. 
                                     (to Troi) 
                             Take the wheel, Commander.

                   Troi takes the ship's wheel.

 RIKER                                      (shouts)
                             All hands make sail! Raise up 
                             tacks and stand by the braces!

                   The crew springs into action... rushing to their places 
                   aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines...
                   starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the 
                   yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail.

 44 44 THRU OMITTED THRU 45 45 
 46 PICARD AND RIKER 46 
                   Picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great 
                   satisfaction and  contentment.

 PICARD                              Imagine what it was like, Will. No 
                             engines... no computers... just 
                             the wind, the sea and the stars to 
                             guide you.

 RIKER                              Bad food, brutal discipline... 
                                     (beat) 
                             No women.

                   But Picard won't let Riker rain on his parade -- he's 
                   thoroughly enjoying himself.

 COM VOICE                              Bridge to Captain Picard.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 COM VOICE                              There is a personal message for 
                             you from Earth.

 PICARD                                      (annoyed)
                             Put it through down here. 
                                     (to Riker) 
                             But the best thing about a life at 
                             sea was that they couldn't get to 
                             you.

                   Picard walks toward the bow.

 PICARD                                      (to com)
                             Computer, arch.

 46A ANGLE (VFX-P) 46A 
                   A U-shaped ARCH with several computer panels visible 
                   appears on the forecastle. It's a strange sight to see 
                   a piece of the 24th century on the deck of this ship. 
                   Picard goes to the arch and activates one of the 
                   monitors and waits for the transmission to appear.

 46B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 46B 
                   A text message APPEARS and he starts to read it. After 
                   a moment, he reacts with shock and dismay to something 
                   on the screen.

 47 ON TROI 47 
                   whose attention has been drawn to Picard, at the arch. 
                   She reacts with concern at the expression on his face.

 TROI                                       (to crewmember)
                             Here. Take the wheel.

                   just read something on the screen which is very 
                   disturbing. 

                   He stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi 
                   moves to him.

 TROI                                      (quiet)
                             Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse 
                             me...

                   He turns OFF the screen.

                   clearly distracted as he EXITS to the Corridor. Troi 
                   looks after him with concern.

                   Worf looks at him blankly for a moment.

 WORF                              The Royal... studs...?

 COM VOICE                              We're picking up a distress call 
                             from the Amargosa observatory, 
                             sir. They say they're under 
                             attack.

 RIKER                                       (to all)
                             Red Alert! All hands to

                   Everyone on the ship reacts, and there is a general 
                   rush to the bow of the ship...

                   ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a 
                   complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch 
                   marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g.
                   a YELLOW SUN can be seen.)

                   all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony. 
                   The ship is at Red Alert. The image of the burnt-out 
                   observatory is on the VIEWSCREEN.

 RIKER                              It looks like we're too late...

                             There are no other ships in the 
                             system.

 DATA                              Sensors show five life signs 
                             aboard the station, Captain.

 RIKER                              The station complement was 
                             nineteen.

                   A grim beat. Picard gets up and starts heading for the 
                   Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost 
                   irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern 
                   of his.

 PICARD                              Secure from Red Alert. Number

                             be in my Ready Room.

                   Troi and Riker exchange a surprised look.

 RIKER                              Sir?

 PICARD                                      (hard)
                             Make it so.

                   Picard EXITS. An awkward beat. What's wrong with the 
                   Captain? But they have their orders. 

                   As Riker and  Worf head for the EXIT...

 CUT TO: 
 52 INT. OBSERVATORY - OPS CENTER (VFX-P) 52 
                   The station is a SMOKING RUIN -- consoles flickering, 
                   lights dim, damage everywhere. Only a few minutes have 
                   passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly
                   and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back 
                   in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has 
                   a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is 
                   cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out 
                   consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear 
                   view of the room.

 WORF                              These blast patterns are 
                             consistent with type-three 
                             disruptors.

 RIKER                              Well, that narrows it to Klingon, 
                             Breen or Romulan.

                   Beverly follows her tricorder readings.

 BEVERLY                              I'm picking up life signs... about 
                             twenty meters ahead.

 WORF                              That rules out Klingons.

                   Riker gives him a look.

 WORF                              They would not have left anyone 
                             alive.

 BEVERLY                              Over here.

                   They pick their way carefully through the carnage of 
                   the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet 
                   Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the 
                   back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his 
                   uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of 
                   her medical kit and begins to treat him.

 RIKER                              Worf, you're with me. Paskall, 
                             you and Mendez search the upper 
                             deck.

                   The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker 
                   and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops 
                   at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but 
                   they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far 
                   corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a 
                   collapsed bulkhead.

 WORF                              Under here...

                   They both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it 
                   aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a 
                   HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of 
                   rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the 
                   man's hand.

 WORF                              It's all right... do not struggle.

                   Worf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final 
                   console. We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran, 
                   one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen 
                   in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged 
                   at all over the years but he does have a permanent 
                   scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a 
                   few times, seems a little dazed.
 RIKER                              I'm Commander William Riker of the
                             Starship Enterprise.

 SORAN                              Soran... Doctor Tolian Soran...

                   Soran puts a hand to his head, still trying to get his 
                   bearings.

 RIKER                              Who attacked you, Doctor?

 SORAN                              I'm not sure... it happened so 
                             fast...

 SECURITY OFFICER                                      (calls out)
                             Commander -- you'd better take a 
                             look at this.

                   Riker and Worf move to the ladder as Beverly begins to 
                   scan Soran...

 53 NEW ANGLE - UPPER DECK 53 
                   Riker and Worf move over to the two Security Guards who 
                   are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from 
                   view. One guard turns over the body, revealing a 
                   ROMULAN SOLDIER. Worf looks at him in disgust.

 WORF                              Romulan.

                   Riker and Worf exchange a look. OFF their reactions...

 54 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS 54 
                   Data is sitting in a chair, petting SPOT THE CAT. 
                   Geordi is standing next to him.

 DATA                             Is she still angry?

 GEORDI                             No... but I'd stay out of Sickbay 
                            for a while if I were you. I 
                            still don't know why you dropped

                            would be humorous.

                   Data frowns. troubled by this recent experience. He 
                   puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead. He activates 
                   a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN,
                   revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP  which is suspended in 
                   a glass and metal framework. Data looks at the chip 
                   for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern.

 GEORDI                             Data... you're not thinking about 
                            using that thing are you?

 DATA                             It has occurred to me on several 
                            occasions. But I believe this may 
                            be the appropriate time.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute. I thought you've 
                            always been afraid it would 
                            overload your neural net.

 DATA                             That is true. However, I believe 
                            my growth as an artificial 
                            life form has reached an impasse. 
                            For thirty-four years I have 
                            endeavored to become more "human" -
                            to grow beyond my original 
                            programming. And yet I am still 
                            unable to grasp such a simple 
                            concept as humor.

                            This emotion chip is the only 
                            answer.

                   Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip...
                   and reluctantly has to agree.

 GEORDI                             All right...

                   Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.

 GEORDI                             But at the first sign of trouble, 
                            I'm going to deactivate it. 
                            agreed?

 DATA                             Agreed.

                   Geordi works on Data's head for a moment, and then
                   OPENS a panel on Data's head, revealing the blinking

                   Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned 
                   and is staring out the window. Picard seems distracted 
                   during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker 
                   finishes his report.

 RIKER                             We found two dead Romulans aboard 
                            the station. We're analyzing 
                            their equipment to see if we can 
                            determine what ship they came 
                            from.

                   Picard nods absently.

 PICARD                             There's still no indication of why 
                            they attacked the station?

 RIKER                             We think they were looking for 
                            something -- they practically tore 
                            the place apart.

 PICARD                             Hmm...

                            Inform Starfleet Command. This 
                            could indicate a new Romulan 
                            threat in this sector.

 RIKER                             You want me to contact Starfleet?

 PICARD                             Is there a problem?

 RIKER                             No, sir.

 PICARD                             Thank you, Number One.

                   Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window. 
                   Riker hesitates, awkward.

 RIKER                             There is something else, Captain. 
                            One of the scientists. a Doctor
                            Soran... has insisted on speaking 
                            with you. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I told him you were busy, sir, but 
                            he said it was absolutely 
                            imperative that he speak with you 
                            right away.

 PICARD                             Understood. That will be all.

 RIKER                             Sir... is there anything wrong?

 PICARD                             No. Thank you.

                   A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS. Off Picard's

                   comes over -- she has not aged at all since the 
                   Enterprise-B. She sets down an exotic-looking container 
                   full of dark liquid.

 GUINAN                             You two just volunteered to be my 
                            first victims. 
                                     (re: liquid)
                            This is a new concoction I 
                            picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, 
                            you're going to love it.

                   She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one 
                   and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him 
                   closely. Data frowns.

 GEORDI                             Well...?

 DATA                             I believe the beverage has 
                            provoked an emotional response.

 GEORDI                             Really? What do you feel?

 DATA                             I am uncertain. I have had little 
                            experience with emotions... I am 
                            unable to articulate the 
                            sensation.

 GUINAN                             Emotions?

 GEORDI                             I'll explain later...

                   Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make 
                   sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one 
                   of disgust.

 GUINAN                                       (to Geordi)
                            I don't think he likes it.

 DATA                                      (excited)
                            Yes. That is it. I hate it.

 GEORDI                             Data, I think the chip is 
                            working...

                   Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face.

 DATA                             Yes. I hate this! It is 
                            revolting!

                   Beat.

 GUINAN                             Another round?

 DATA                             Please.

                   In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward.

 57 FOLLOW PICARD 57 
                   as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a 
                   table by the windows. Soran is sitting at the table, 
                   staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His 
                   observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart 
                   from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the 
                   table.

 PICARD                             Doctor Soran...?

 SORAN                             Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for 
                            coming.

                   The men shake hands and Picard sits down. Soran is an 
                   imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems 
                   very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his 
                   work. Picard waves away a waiter.

 PICARD                             Nothing for me. 
                                     (brusque, to Soran) 
                            I understand there's something 
                            urgent you need to discuss with 
                            me.

 SORAN                             Yes. I need to return to the 
                            observatory immediately. I must 
                            continue a critical experiment I 
                            was running on the Amargosa star.
                    Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't 
                   sound that imperative to him.

 PICARD                             Doctor... we're still conducting 
                            an investigation into the attack. 
                            Once we've completed our work, 
                            we'll be happy to allow you and 
                            your fellow scientists back aboard 
                            the observatory. Until then --

 SORAN                             The timing is very important on my 
                            experiment -- if it is not
                            completed within the next twelve 
                            hours, years of research will be 
                            lost.

 PICARD                             We're doing the best we can. Now 
                            if you'll excuse me...

                   Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently 
                   but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected 
                   physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's 
                   face stops Picard in his tracks.

 SORAN                                      (cryptically)
                            They say time is the fire in 
                            which we burn... and right now, 
                            Captain, my time is running out. 
                                     (beat) 
                            We leave so many things unfinished 
                            in our lives -- I'm sure you can 
                            understand.

                   For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord 
                   within Picard.

                   He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks 
                   for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice 
                   is barely above a whisper.
 PICARD                             I'll see what I can do...

                   Picard walks away without a word before Soran can 
                   thank him. Soran looks after him with relief, then 
                   pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it. He 
                   looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it 
                   closed and head for the opposite exit from the one 
                   Picard took. FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until 
                   he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...

 58 SORAN'S POV 58 
                   of Guinan, who is now back at the bar.

 59 RESUME SORAN 59 
                   A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the 
                   sight of Guinan. He quickly turns and EXITS.

 60 ON GUINAN 60 
                   she begins to sense something, as though someone is 
                   watching her. She turns, looks in the direction where 
                   Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now. 
                   She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.

 CUT TO: 
 61 INT. ENGINEERING 61 
                   A short time later. A Romulan tricorder is connected 
                   to some diagnostic equipment near a console. Worf is 
                   talking to Riker.

                   Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram 
                   of sensor information.

 WORF                             One of the dead Romulans had a 
                            tricorder. We analyzed its sensor 
                            logs and found they were scanning 
                            for signature particles of a 
                            compound called trilithium.

 RIKER                             Trilithium?

 WORF                             An experimental compound the 
                            Romulans have been working on. In 
                            theory, a trilithium-based 
                            explosive would be thousands of 
                            times more powerful than an 
                            anti-matter weapon. But they never 
                            found a way to stabilize it.
 RIKER                             Why were they looking for it on a 
                            Federation observatory? It doesn't
                            make any sense.

                   Riker considers.

 RIKER                                      (cont'd)
                            Have Geordi and Data go over with 
                            the next Away Team...  tell them to 
                            scan the observatory for 
                            trilithium.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 CUT TO: 
 62 INT. OBSERVATORY OPS 62 
                   The station is still a wreck. Geordi and Data are 
                   scanning the room with tricorders.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                            There's no sign of any trilithium 
                            in here.

                   Geordi continues to scan... then suddenly Data lets out 
                   a quiet GIGGLE. Geordi stops and turns to look at him.
                   Data giggles louder.

 DATA                                      (laughing, to himself)
                            I get it. I get it.

 GEORDI                             You get what?

                   Data laughs again.

 DATA                             When you said to Commander 
                            Riker...
                                     (imitating Geordi's voice) 
                            "The clown can stay, but the 
                            Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to 
                            go."

                   Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment.

 GEORDI                             What?

 DATA                             During the Farpoint mission. We 
                            were on the Bridge and you told a 
                            joke. That was the punch line.

 GEORDI                             The Farpoint mission? Data, that 
                            was seven years ago.

 DATA                             I know. I just got it. 
                                     (laughs) 
                            It was very funny.

 GEORDI                             Thanks.

                   Geordi indicates a corridor. They EXIT in that 
                   direction...

 63 INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 63 
                   A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other 
                   compartments. Geordi suddenly stops in front of what 
                   appears to be a standard bulkhead.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute... there's a hidden 
                            doorway here. I can see the 
                            joint of the metal with my VISOR.

                   Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what 
                   appears to be a smooth bulkhead.

 DATA                                     (off tricorder)
                            There appears to be a dampening 
                            field in operation. I cannot scan 
                            beyond the bulkhead.

                   Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for 
                   a way to open the door.

 GEORDI                             I don't see a control panel...or 
                            an access port.

 DATA                                      (off tricorder)
                            It appears to be a magnetically 
                            sealed.

                   Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist 
                   and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within.

 DATA                             I believe I can reverse the 
                            polarity by attenuating my axial 
                            servo.

                   Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist 
                   over the door panel.

 DATA                                      (joking)
                            "Open sesame."

                   There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK. The 
                   door slides open.

 DATA                                      (smiles)
                            You could say I have a... magnetic 
                            personality.

                   Geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace. They EXIT 
                   to.

 64 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 64 
                   A small room with several probes stacked in holding 
                   racks. Geordi and Data scan.

 GEORDI                             I'm still not picking up anything. 
                            Someone went to a lot of trouble 
                            to shield this room.

                   They put their tricorders away and begin looking around 
                   the room. Data continues to snicker and giggle as he 
                   tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up. 
                   Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops
                   at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to 
                   the side.

 GEORDI                             Data, take a look at this. 
                                     (Data comes over) 
                            You ever seen a solar probe with 
                            this kind of configuration?

                   Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he 
                   opens and closes it like a mouth.

 DATA                                      (making tricorder "talk")
                            No, Geordi. I have not. It is 
                            most unusual.
                    Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of 
                   someone listening to a very bad comedian.
 GEORDI                             Just help me get this panel open.

                   Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the 
                   casing of the probe. They open the panel and Geordi
                   looks inside.he reacts to something.

 GEORDI                             Whoa. my VISOR'S picking up 
                            something in the theta band...it 
                            could be a trilithium signature.

                   Data suddenly start LAUGHING. Geordi turns in 
                   irritation.

 GEORDI                             Data, this isn't the time...

 DATA                                      (laughing)
                            I am sorry... but I cannot stop 
                            myself... I think something is 
                            wrong...

 64A ANGLE (VFX-P) 64A 
                   Data's laughter escalates into hysteria... then Data 
                   begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre 
                   "emotional seizure." A rush of EMOTIONS race across 
                   his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic 
                   blur of reactions contort his features. Then it stops 
                   and he FALLS to the ground.

 GEORDI                             Data!

                   Geordi rushes to him. Data has a look of surprise on 
                   his face as he blinks a few times. He sits up.

 GEORDI                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             I believe the emotional chip has 
                            overloaded my positronic relays.

 GEORDI                             We better get you back to the 
                            Ship. 
                                     (hits combadge) 
                            La Forge to Enterprise.

                   There's no response. Geordi frowns for a beat, then we 
                   hear Soran's voice.

 SORAN                             Is there a problem, gentlemen?

 65 INCLUDE SORAN 65 
                   standing in the room. Geordi didn't hear him come in.

 GEORDI                             Oh... Doctor... yeah, as a matter 
                            of fact, there is. There's a 
                            damping field in here blocking 
                            our com signal. 
                                     (re: Data) 
                            Will you give me a hand?

                   Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the 
                   solar probe Geordi was inspecting. He notes the opened 
                   panel and a disturbed look crosses his face. 

                   Soran looks back at Geordi.

 SORAN                             I'd be happy to.

                   Soran moves toward them. and then without warning, he 
                   punches Geordi in the face, KNOCKING the VISOR across 
                   the room. He whirls around and points a phaser at 
                   Data, who suddenly looks fearful.

 DATA                             Please don't hurt me.

 CUT TO: 
 66 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS 66 
                   Picard is standing at the replicator.

 PICARD                             Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.

                   The cup of tea APPEARS in the replicator and at the 
                   same moment, the door CHIMES.

 PICARD                             Come.

                   Troi ENTERS. Picard would rather not be bothered right 
                   now, but he is polite as always.

 PICARD                             Counselor. What can I do for you?

 TROI                             Actually... I'm here to see if 
                            there's anything I can do for you.

 PICARD                             Well... I appreciate your concern, 
                            but I'd rather not discuss it 
                            right now, thank you.
                    But Troi won't be brushed away so easily.

 TROI                             I'm afraid I can't just leave it 
                            at that. The commanding officer 
                            of this ship is clearly distraught 
                            about something. As ship's 
                            Counselor, it's my duty to --

 PICARD                             As ship's counselor, it's your 
                            duty to know not only when you're 
                            needed... but also when you're 
                            not.

 TROI                             You can't fool an empath, Captain. 
                            I know exactly when I'm needed.

                   Picard is really not in the mood for this. His tone 
                   hardens.

 PICARD                             Well, with all due respect to your 
                            Betazoid senses, I prefer to be 
                            alone right now.

 TROI                             Very well. I suppose I could make 
                            out my weekly report to Starfleet
                            Command without your input. 
                                     (beat) 
                            "Admiral Lusby... regarding the 
                            unusual behavior of Jean-Luc 
                            Picard: I find him increasingly 
                            Irritable... remote... and 
                            uncooperative. I recommend forced 
                            shore leave at a Starbase facility 
                            in order to --"

 PICARD                             All right, all right. You've made 
                            your point.

                   Troi takes a seat and patiently waits. Picard gets 
                   up.moves around the room for a moment...and stops. 
                   He speaks in a flat, unemotional tone of voice.

 PICARD                             The message I received...
                                     (beat) 
                            My brother... and his son -- my 
                            nephew -- burned to death in a 
                            fire.

                   Troi reacts, genuinely surprised.
 TROI                             Captain, I'm sorry. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I know there were a lot of 
                            unresolved conflicts between you 
                            and your brother.

 PICARD                             What I can't get out of my mind is 
                            the image of Rene -- my nephew. 
                            I just can't believe he's gone...

                   He trails off.

 TROI                             It's only natural to feel a 
                            heightened sense of tragedy when 
                            a child dies...
                                     (sensing more) 
                            But it goes deeper than that, 
                            doesn't it? I can sense that Rene 
                            meant a great deal to you.

 PICARD                             In a way, he was as close as I 
                            ever came to having a child of my 
                            own.

                   Troi eyes an open photo album on the table. She reaches 
                   over and flips through the pages for a moment. There 
                   are many photos inside... from many periods in time
                   including one of Picard's brother standing next to his 
                   young son. This is the Picard family album.

 TROI                             Your family history is very 
                            important to you, isn't it?

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            Ever since I was a little boy, I 
                            remember hearing about the family 
                            line. The Picards that fought at 
                            Trafalgar... the Picard's that 
                            settled the first Martian colony. 
                            When my brother married and had a 
                            son...

                   Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him.

 TROI                             ... You felt it was no longer your 
                            responsibility to carry on the 
                            family line.

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            My brother had shouldered that 
                            burden... allowing me to pursue my 
                            own selfish needs...

 TROI                             There's nothing selfish about 
                            pursuing your own life... your own 
                            career.

                   Picard moves to the window, stares outside. A shadow 
                   crosses his face. He's getting to the heart of the 
                   matter.

 PICARD                             You know, Counselor... I'm not 
                            getting any younger. For some 
                            time now, I've been aware that 
                            there are fewer days ahead than 
                            there are behind...
                                     (beat) 
                            But I always took comfort in the 
                            fact that when I was gone, my
                            family would continue. But now...

                   Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the 
                   last page, an then flips through the remaining pages --
                   they are blank.

 PICARD                             I've had brushes with death...
                            more than I care to contemplate. 
                            I always accepted it as a 
                            calculated risk that goes along 
                            with wearing this uniform. 
                                     (beat) 
                            But now... the idea of death has 
                            a terrible sense of finality to 
                            it.

                   He looks at her.

 PICARD                             I'm the last Picard.

                   A quiet beat as Troi considers him.

 TROI                             Captain, perhaps we --

                   Suddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT  from outside the 
                   windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to 
                   the window and shield their eyes against the glare.

                   getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris 
                   is being ejected into space.

 PICARD                             Report.

 RIKER                             A quantum implosion has occurred 
                            within the Amargosa star. All
                            nuclear fusion is breaking down.

 PICARD                             How is that possible?

 WORF                             Sensor records show a solar probe 
                            was launched from the observatory 
                            a few moments ago.

 RIKER                             The star's going to collapse in a 
                            matter of minutes.

                   Something beeps on Worf's console.

 WORF                             Sir, the implosion has produced 
                            a level twelve shock wave.

 TROI                                      (shocked)
                            Level twelve? That'll destroy 
                            everything in this system.

 RIKER                                      (to Worf)
                            Did they return to the ship?

                            No, sir. They are not aboard.

 PICARD                             How long until the shock wave hits 
                            the observatory?

 WORF                             Four minutes, forty seconds.

                   Picard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 RIKER                             Mister Worf.

                   Riker and Worf EXIT.

                   The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the

                   depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the 
                   door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his 
                   phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just 
                   outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined 
                   earlier is now gone.)

 RIKER                                      (to Worf)
                            What the hell's he doing?

                   Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying 
                   unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen.

                            Soran, did you hear that? There's 
                            a level twelve shock wave coming.
                            We've got to get out of here!

                   Soran's only answer is another phaser blast.

 72 INT. BRIDGE 72 
                   As before. ENSIGN HAYES is at Tactical. An ALARM 
                   suddenly BEEPS on the Tactical console.

 HAYES                                      (urgent)
                            Sir. A Klingon Bird of Prey is 
                            decloaking off the port bow.

                   Shocked reactions.

 PICARD                             What?

 73 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 73 
                   as an old-style Klingon Bird of Prey decloaks near the 
                   observatory.

 74 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P) 74 
                   Soran is continuing to SHOOT at Riker and Worf. Riker 
                   suddenly notices something off-camera.

 74A RIKER'S POV 74A 
                   Data is huddled in a corner of the room, cowering in 
                   fear.

 74B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 74B 
                   The firefight continues.

 RIKER                             Data! See if you can get to 
                            Geordi!

                   Data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face.

 DATA                             I... cannot, sir. I believe I 
                            Am... afraid.

                   Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS. Soran reaches 
                   down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and 
                   the two of them DEMATERIALIZE. (Soran has the VISOR in
                   his hand.) Riker, Data and Worf react.

                   The Enterprise warps away just as the shock wave 
                   reaches the observatory and vaporizes it in a fiery 
 EXPLOSION. 
 CUT TO: 
 78 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE 78 
                   On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of 
                   the darkening star and shock wave. MOVE TO REVEAL

                   We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and 
                   patched in several places, obviously not a first-line 
                   model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, 
                   two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters. 
                   aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D. 
                   male Klingons man the various stations.

                   The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in 
                   awe.

 B'ETOR                             Toh-pak-cha... 
                            (Glorious...)

 LURSA                             HoS qorDu... 
                            (A great power...)

                   Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark 
                   and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he 
                   strides up to the sisters.

 B'ETOR                                      (excited, to Soran)
                            You've done it, Soran.

                   But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the 
                   jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several 
                   Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons...
                   but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.

 B'ETOR                             Wait!

                   She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her 
                   mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.

 B'ETOR                             I hope for your sake that you are 
                            initiating a mating ritual.
 SORAN                             You got careless. The Romulans 
                            came looking for their missing 
                            trilithium.

 B'ETOR                             Impossible. We left no survivors 
                            on their outpost.

                   B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.

 SORAN                             They knew it was aboard the 
                            observatory. If the Enterprise 
                            hadn't intervened, they would have 
                            found it.

 LURSA                             But they didn't find it... and now 
                            we have a weapon of unlimited 
                            power.

 SORAN                             I have the weapon, Lursa. And if 
                            you ever want me to give it to 
                            you, I advise you to be a little 
                            more careful in the future.

                   B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to 
                   his throat.

 B'ETOR                             Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

                   Soran is unfazed by this threat.

 SORAN                             Without my research... the
                            trilithium is worthless... as are 
                            your plans to reconquer the 
                            Klingon Empire.

                   Lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife 
                   away.

 SORAN                             Set course for the Veridian 
                            system. Maximum warp.

                   A KLINGON GUARD ENTERS dragging the unconscious Geordi.

 KLINGON GUARD                             What shall I do with this?

                   Soran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face.
 SORAN                             Bring him with me. I need some 
                            answers from Mr. La Forge.

                   Soran EXITS.

                   Riker and Worf are on the move down the corridor.

 WORF                             I have spoken to the Klingon High 
                            Council, sir. They identified the 
                            Bird of Prey as belonging to the 
                            Duras sisters.

 RIKER                                     (surprised)
                            Lursa and B'Etor...? This doesn't 
                            make any sense. A renowned 
                            stellar physicist somehow uses a 
                            trilithium probe to destroy a 
                            star, kidnaps Geordi... and 
                            escapes with a pair of Klingon 
                            renegades... Why? What the hell's 
                            going on?

                   They EXIT to...

 81 INT. SICKBAY 81 
                   Worf and Riker ENTER. Beverly is closing a panel on 
                   the back of Data's head. He is sitting on a bio-bed, 
                   scanning himself with a tricorder.

 RIKER                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                             It looks like a power surge fused 
                            the emotional chip into his neural
                            net.

 WORF                             Will that be a danger to him?

 BEVERLY                             I don't think so. The chip still 
                            seems to be working. I'd feel 
                            better if I could take a closer
                            look, but I can't remove it 
                            without completely dismantling his 
                            cerebral conduit.

 RIKER                                      (to Data)
                            Looks like you're stuck with 
                            emotions for a while. How do you 
                            feel?

 DATA                             I am quite... preoccupied with 
                            concern about Geordi.

 RIKER                             We all are, Data. But we're going 
                            to get him back.

 DATA                             I hope so, sir.

                   Data's expression is still one of concern. Beverly 
                   pulls Riker aside.

 BEVERLY                             Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's 
                            background.

                   Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of 
                   Doctor Soran along with some biographical information 
                   appears.

 BEVERLY                             He's an El-Aurian... over three 
                            hundred years old. He lost his 
                            entire family when the Borg 
                            destroyed his world. Soran 
                            escaped with a handful of other 
                            refugees aboard a ship called the 
                            Lakul. The ship was destroyed by 
                            some kind of energy ribbon, but 
                            Soran and forty-six others were 
                            rescued by the Enterprise-B.

 RIKER                                      (reacts)
                            That was the mission where James 
                            Kirk was killed.

 BEVERLY                             I checked the passenger manifest 
                            of the Lakul... guess who else was 
                            on board?

                   She hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears 
                   on the screen. Riker reacts to the image...

 CUT TO: 
 82 INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS 82 
                   Close on Guinan as she looks up, surprised.

 GUINAN                             Soran? That's a name I haven't 
                            heard in a long time.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any
                   of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard 
                   furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The 
                   floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are 
                   draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and 
                   subdued.

                   Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross-
                   legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an 
                   easy familiarity... two old friends who know each 
                   other well.

 PICARD                             Do you remember him?

 GUINAN                             Oh yes. I remember everyone who 
                            was on the Lakul... every face.
                            even the ones who didn't make 
                            it...

                   Guinan stands and begins to move about the room...
                   she's clearly troubled by the memories. She hesitates, 
                   looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments. 
                   Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                             Guinan. It's important that you 
                            tell me what you know. We think 
                            Soran's developed a weapon... a 
                            terrible weapon. It might give 
                            him enough power to --

 GUINAN                             Soran doesn't care about power or 
                            weapons. All he cares about is 
                            getting back to the Nexus.

 PICARD                             What's the "Nexus"?

                   Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some 
                   exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting 
                   herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.

 GUINAN                             It's a place I've tried very hard 
                            to forget...

                   She makes the decision to plunge ahead.

 GUINAN                             That ribbon isn't just some random 
                            energy phenomenon traveling 
                            through space... it's a doorway. 
                            It leads to another place... the 
                            Nexus. It doesn't exist in our 
                            Universe... and it doesn't play by 
                            the same rules either.

 PICARD                             What happened to you?

 GUINAN                             I can't remember very much... what 
                            it looked like or how long I was
                            there... but I do remember how it 
                            felt...

                   She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind 
                   of awe at the memory.

 GUINAN                             It was like being inside... joy. 
                            As if joy was a real thing that I
                            could wrap around myself. I've 
                            never been so content...

                   A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.

 PICARD                             But then you were beamed away...

                   Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.

 GUINAN                             I was pulled away. I didn't want 
                            to leave; none of us did. I felt 
                            like I'd left a part of myself 
                            behind. All I could think about 
                            was getting back... I didn't care 
                            what I had to do.

                   Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.

 GUINAN                             It took a long time, but 
                            eventually I learned to live with 
                            it. And I began to realize that 
                            my experience in the Nexus had 
                            changed me...
                                     (beat)
                            I knew things about people...
                            about events...about time...

 PICARD                             Your "sixth sense"... I've always 
                            wondered where it came from...
                                     (beat) 
                            And what about Soran?

 GUINAN                             Soran may still be obsessed with 
                            getting back. And if he is, he'll 
                            do anything to find that doorway 
                            again.

 PICARD                             But why destroy a star...? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Thank you, Guinan.

                   He heads for the door.

 GUINAN                             Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.

                   Picard stops, looks at her.

 GUINAN                             Let them send another starship. 
                            Don't get near the ribbon. If you 
                            go into that Nexus, you're not 
                            going to care about Soran or the 
                            Enterprise or me. All you're 
                            going to care about is how it 
                            feels to be there.
                                    (beat) 
                            And you're never going to come 
                            back.

                   Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her 
                   eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.

 CUT TO: 
 83 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS (VFX-P) 83 
                   A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon 
                   ship. Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the 
                   room looks well-worn and ill-maintained. Soran is 
                   seated behind a table, holding the VISOR. A PADD and 
                   Soran's pocket watch sit on the table. Geordi is 
                   sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has 
                   been removed. He looks very tense.
 SORAN                                      (re: VISOR)
                            A remarkable piece of equipment...
                            but a little inelegant, wouldn't 
                            you say? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Have you ever considered a 
                            prosthesis that would make you 
                            look a little more... normal?

 GEORDI                             What's normal?

 SORAN                             Normal is what everyone else is...
                            and what you are not.

 GEORDI                             What do you want?

                   Soran takes a moment.

 SORAN                             As you may or may not be aware, I 
                            am an El-Aurian. Some people call 
                            us a race of "listeners". We 
                            listen. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Right now, Mr. La Forge, you 
                            have my undivided attention. I 
                            want to listen to everything you 
                            know about trilithium. and me.

                   Geordi thinks.

 GEORDI                             Trilithium is an experimental 
                            compound developed by the 
                            Romulans. I think it's a 
                            derivative of --

                   Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it. 
                   Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be 
                   seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his 
                   chest. Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the 
                   protrusion is suddenly gone.

 SORAN                             I don't want a science lecture. 
                            You were on that observatory 
                            looking for trilithium... why?

 GEORDI                             I was ordered to by the Captain.

                   On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior 
                   graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair. The 
                   graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves. 
                   A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe 
                   inside his body. Right now, the dot is in the middle 
                   of his chest.

 SORAN                             Let's try to move beyond the usual 
                            prisoner-interrogator banter, 
                            shall we? You have information, 
                            and I need it. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Did the Captain explain his orders 
                            to you? Did he say why you were 
                            searching for trilithium?

 GEORDI                             No.

 SORAN                             What about... Guinan? What has 
                            she told you about me?

 GEORDI                             Guinan? I don't know what you're 
                            talking about...

                   On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position 
                   next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi.

 SORAN                             My instincts tell me you're lying. 
                            And I know that can't be easy for
                            you... 
                                     (off PADD) 
                            I can see you have a good heart.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi
                   grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a 
                   few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps 
                   and starts to breathe.

 SORAN                             Oh... I forgot to tell you. While 
                            you were unconscious, I injected 
                            a nano-probe into your 
                            bloodstream. It's been navigating 
                            your cardiovascular system... and 
                            right now I've attached it to your 
                            left ventricle. 
                                     (smiles) 
                            A little trick I picked up 
                            from the Borg.

 GEORDI                                      (gasping)
                            Yeah... they're full of great 
                            ideas.

 SORAN                             I just stopped your heart for five 
                            seconds. It felt like an 
                            eternity, didn't it? Did you know 
                            that you can stop the human heart 
                            for up to ten minutes before the 
                            onset of brain damage?

 GEORDI                             No... I didn't know that...

 SORAN                             We learn something new about 
                            ourselves every day. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Now. Maybe I didn't make myself 
                            clear. It is very important that 
                            you tell me exactly what Captain 
                            Picard knows.

 GEORDI                             I told you everything... you might 
                            as well just kill me right now...

                   Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a 
                   moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's 
                   a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.

 SORAN                             I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Let's try thirty seconds.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and 
                   strains against an unimaginable pain.

                   Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover...
                   sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick
                   away...

 CUT TO: 
 84 INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P) 84 
                   A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and 
                   computers which handle the enormous task of tracking 
                   the ship's position in space. 

                   The monitors around the room display various diagrams 
                   of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the 
                   film).

                   Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great 
                   deal of complex information on the screen. Picard is 
                   standing next to him. Throughout the following, Data 
                   seems distracted and preoccupied.
 DATA                             According to our information, the 
                            ribbon is a conflux of temporal 
                            energy which travels through our 
                            galaxy every thirty-nine point one 
                            years

 PICARD                             When is it expected back?

                   Data doesn't answer right away.

 PICARD                             Data?

 DATA                             Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has 
                            already entered the galaxy. It 
                            will pass through this sector in 
                            approximately thirty-one hours.

                   Picard moves about the room... he's frustrated... 
                   tired... but determined to find out what's going on.

 PICARD                             Guinan said Soran was trying to 
                            get back to the ribbon... if 
                            that's true, then there must be 
                            some connection with the Amargosa 
                            star.

 DATA                             The star's destruction has had 
                            numerous astro-physical effects 
                            within this sector. However, none 
                            of them appear to have a 
                            connection to the energy ribbon.

 PICARD                             Give me a list of those effects. 
                            I want to know every single thing 
                            which has been altered or 
                            changed... no matter how 
                            insignificant...

 DATA                             It will take a few moments for the 
                            computer to compile the 
                            information.

                   Data works the computer and then the computer begins to 
                   work. Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast 
                   and gloomy. He sits down and puts his head in his 
                   hands. Picard finally has to say something.

 PICARD                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             No, sir. I am finding it 
                            difficult to concentrate... I 
                            believe I am overwhelmed with 
                            feelings of... remorse and regret 
                            concerning my actions on the 
                            observatory.

 PICARD                             What do you mean?

 DATA                             I wanted to save Geordi... I 
                            tried. but I experienced 
                            something I did not expect. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I believe it was fear.

                   Picard regards him sympathetically.

 PICARD                             Fear is a very difficult emotion 
                            to overcome. It's something we 
                            all have to learn to deal with.

 DATA                             But I did not deal with it, sir. 
                            I let it prevent me from helping 
                            my friend. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Does that make me a coward?

 PICARD                             No. And what you must try to

                            Guilt. It is a most unpleasant

                            the Amargosa star has had the 
                            following effects in this sector: 
                            gamma emissions have increased by
                            five percent... the starship 
                            Bozeman was forced to make a
                            course correction... a research
                            project on Gorik Four was 
                            halted due to increased neutrino

                            fields have decreased by --

 PICARD                             Wait. The Bozeman... why did it 
                            change course?

 DATA                                      (matter of fact)
                            The destruction of the Amargosa 
                            star has altered the gravitational
                            forces throughout the sector. Any 
                            ship passing through this region 
                            will have to make a minor course 
                            correction.

                   Picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto 
                   something here. He moves to a large table in the 
                   center of the room.

 PICARD                                      (musing)

 84B ANGLE (VFX-P) 84B 
                   Data moves to the table to work. after a few beats, 
                   an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the 
                   ceiling of the room. A BLINKING DOT shows the position 
                   of the ribbon.

 DATA                             This is its current position.

 PICARD                             Can you project its course?

                   Data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional 
                   turmoil. Picard finally has to lay down the law.

 PICARD                                      (firm)
                            Data. I have nothing but sympathy 
                            for what you're going through. 
                            But right now, I need your full 
                            attention on the task at hand.  
                            If you can't provide it... then I'll 
                            have to relieve you of duty until 
                            Doctor Crusher can remove this.
                            emotion chip of yours. I'm sorry, 
                            but you leave me no other choice.

                   This snaps Data back... he considers this for a long 
                   moment, then looks  determined.

 DATA                             I do not wish to remove the chip, 
                            sir. Although these emotions are
                            proving difficult to deal with...
                            I cannot imagine going back to a 
                            life without them. I have taken 
                            an important step toward becoming 
                            truly human. If I were to turn 
                            back now...

                            I would like to continue in my 
                            duties, sir.

                   Picard smiles at him.

 PICARD                             Courage is an emotion too, Data.

                            Now... can you project the course
                            of the ribbon?

 PICARD                             Where was the Amargosa star?

                   Data works. A STAR is highlighted near the red line.

 PICARD                             Now... you said the gravitational
                            forces in this sector have been 
                            altered... could that also affect 
                            the course of the ribbon?

                   position. Picard is beginning to realize what's going on.

 PICARD                             That's what Soran's doing... he's 
                            changing its course.

                            But why? Why try to alter its 
                            path... why not simply fly into it 
                            with a ship?

                   Data thinks for a moment.

 DATA                             Our records show that every ship 
                            which has approached the ribbon 
                            has either been destroyed or 
                            severely damaged.

                   Picard thinks about this... then has a flash of 
                   insight.

 PICARD                             He can't go to the ribbon... so 
                            he's trying to make the ribbon 
                            come to him.

                   The display ZOOMS IN on a star very close to the 
                   ribbon's path. We now see a SOLAR SYSTEM with a single 
                   star and FOUR PLANETS. The RED LINE moves directly 
                   through the system -- it passes very close to the third
                   planet. Picard eyes that planet and points to it.

 PICARD                             It's very close to Veridian 
                            Three... but not close enough...

                   Picard's mind is going a mile a minute. He suddenly 
                   has a horrible realization.

 PICARD                             Data, what would happen to the 
                            ribbon's path if he destroyed the
                            Veridian star itself?

                   Data works. On the display, the Veridian star suddenly 
                   DARKENS and GOES OUT. The RED LINE shifts slightly 
                   until it makes an exact INTERSECTION WITH THE THIRD 
                   PLANET. They both react to this sight. they're both 
                   aware of just how serious this is.

 PICARD                             That's where he's going.

 DATA                             It should be noted, sir, that the 
                            collapse of the Veridian star 
                            would produce a shock wave similar 
                            to the one we observed at 
                            Amargosa.

                            system.

                   Picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.

 PICARD                             Are any of them inhabited?

                   determination in his every move.

                            "Life forms... tiny little 
                            life forms... where are the 
                            life forms --"

 PICARD                             Commander.

 DATA                             Sorry, sir. 
                                     (works) 
                            There is too much interference in 
                            the planet's ionosphere for an 
                            accurate reading.

                   Worf turns to Picard.

 WORF                             Sir, according to my calculations, 
                            a solar probe launched from either
                            the Klingon ship or the planet's 
                            surface will take eleven seconds 
                            to reach the star. 
                                     (beat) 
                            However, since we do not know the 
                            exact point of origin, it will 
                            take us between eight and fifteen 
                            seconds to lock our weapons onto 
                            it.

                   They exchange a grim look.

 RIKER                                      (quiet, to Picard)
                            That's a pretty big margin of 
                            error.

 PICARD                             Too big. How long until the 
                            ribbon arrives?

 DATA                             Approximately forty-seven minutes, 
                            sir.

 PICARD                                      (disturbed)
                            I have to find a way to get to 
                            Soran...

                   An alarm goes off on Worf's console.

 WORF                             Captain, Klingon vessel decloaking 
                            directly ahead.

 88A ANGLE (VFX-I) 88A 
                   On the view screen, the Bird of Prey decloaks.

 WORF                             They are hailing.

 PICARD                             On screen.

 88B ANGLE (VFX-P) 88B 
                   On the view screen, Lursa and B'Etor APPEAR.

 LURSA                             Captain. What an unexpected 
                            pleasure.

 PICARD                             Lursa, I want to talk to Soran.

 LURSA                             I'm afraid the Doctor is no longer 
                            aboard our ship.

 PICARD                             Then I'll beam down to his 
                            location. Just give us his 
                            coordinates.

 B'ETOR                             The Doctor values his privacy. He 
                            would be quite... upset if an 
                            Away Team interrupted him.

 PICARD                             Very well... I'll beam to your 
                            ship and you can transport me to 
                            Soran...

 RIKER                                      (urgent)
                            Sir, you can't trust them. 
                            They'll kill you just like they 
                            Killed Geordi.

                   Lursa and B'Etor exchange a glance.

 LURSA                                      (innocent)
                            We did not kill your Engineer. 
                            He's been... our guest.

 RIKER                             Then return him.

 B'ETOR                             In exchange for what?

 PICARD                             Me... If you let me speak to 
                            Soran.

                   The two sisters appear to consider this for a moment.

 B'ETOR                                      (to Lursa)
                            The Captain would make a much more 
                            valuable hostage.

 LURSA                                      (to Picard)
                            We'll consider it a prisoner 
                            exchange.

 PICARD                             Agreed.

                   The transmission ENDS. Picard heads for the Turbolift.
 PICARD                             Number One, you have the Bridge. 
                            Have Doctor Crusher meet me in
                            Transporter Room Three.

                   As Picard EXITS...

                   Picard stands on the platform. Crusher and NURSE OGAWA 
                   stand nearby. The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his console.

 CHIEF                             Receiving the coordinates, Captain.

 PICARD                             Energize.

                   Picard DEMATERIALIZES -- and at the same instant, 
                   Geordi MATERIALIZES. Beverly and Ogawa rush to his 
                   aide, pull out their tricorders and scan him. Geordi
                   is conscious, and he's wearing his VISOR.

 CUT TO: 
 90 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P) 90                    A large plateau ringed with trees and underbrush. A 
                   single ROCK FACE juts upward, forming a backdrop for the 
                   plateau. Against the rock face, a large SCAFFOLDING has 
                   been erected -- planks and beams forming a complex 
                   structure -- ladders connect each level. It leads to 
                   a narrow ledge a dozen meters above.

                   Picard MATERIALIZES on the plateau. (NOTE: Picard's 
                   combadge is gone and he is unarmed.) A moment as he 
                   looks around. strange animals and birds can be heard. 

                   He turns and sees Soran standing nearby, calmly looking 
                   at his pocket watch. Soran puts the watch away.

 SORAN                             You must think I'm quite the 
                            madman.

 PICARD                             The thought had crossed my mind...

 SORAN                             The only possible reason you're 
                            here is because you're not 
                            entirely confident you can shoot 
                            down my probe after all. So 
                            you've come to dissuade me from 
                            my horrific plan. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Good luck.

                   Soran turns his back on Picard and walks away.

 90A ANGLE (VFX-P) 90A 
                   Picard takes a step to follow him and then is JOLTED
                   backward by a large FORCEFIELD which briefly flashes 
                   into view. The field completely surrounds the plateau, 
                   enclosing Soran and the scaffolding, with Picard on the 
                   outside. OFF Picard's surprise...

 LURSA                             Put it through over here.

                   Lursa and B'Etor move to one of the consoles with a 
                   large monitor. The screen shows STATIC for a few 
                   seconds, then clears to a distorted view of a CEILING
                   on the ENTERPRISE -- this is GEORDI'S POV. (NOTE: The 
                   POV is slightly fritzed, but free of the usual VISOR
                   effects.)

 LURSA                             It's working...

 B'ETOR                             Where is he?

                   Suddenly, Crusher's face looms large in the picture, as 
                   if she's leaning over Geordi. She smiles and starts 
                   talking. We can see her lips move, but we can't hear 
                   what she's saying.

 BEVERLY                                      (silent)
                            Don't worry, there's been no 
                            permanent damage. Your heart is 
                            perfectly fine. There's been a 
                            little arterial damage...

                   Lursa and B'Etor pull back in surprise at the image.

                            you're going to be fine.

 GEORDI                             Thanks, Doc.

 CUT TO: 
 93 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY 93 
                   Picard is walking the perimeter of the invisible 
                   forcefield, looking for some way in. Soran is 
                   concentrating on his PADD as Picard tries to engage him 
                   on some level.

 PICARD                             You don't need to do this, 
                            Soran... I'm sure we could find 
                            another way to get you into this 
                            Nexus.

 93A ANGLE (VFX-P) 93A 
                   Soran gets up and works his control PADD. Suddenly a 
                   probe LAUNCHER DECLOAKS  in the middle of the plateau. 
                   The launcher is a cylindrical apparatus the size of a 
                   small car. 

                   Soran goes to the launcher, steps onto it and begins 
                   working the control panel.

 SORAN                                      (calm, distracted)
                            I've spent eighty years looking 
                            for another way, Captain. This is 
                            the only one. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Of course, you could always come 
                            with me. You fancy yourself an 
                            explorer. Here's a chance to 
                            explore something no human has 
                            ever experienced.

 PICARD                             Not if it means killing over two 
                            hundred million people. 
                                     (beat, then with 
                                      meaning) 
                            I wonder... did your wife Leandra 
                            know that she married a man who 
                            was capable of mass murder?

                   This has touched a nerve in Soran... something dark 
                   and ugly flickers across his face.

 PICARD                                      (continuing; pressing on)
                            When you tucked your children into 
                            bed... do you suppose they ever
                            suspected that their father would 
                            one day kill millions as casually 
                            as he kissed them goodnight?

                   Soran looks up at Picard... and for a moment we can see 
                   that Picard has really gotten to him here... then he 
                   finally smiles a smile that doesn't quite reach his 
                   eyes.

 SORAN                             Nice try.

 LURSA                             He is.

 B'ETOR                             Then when is he going to

                   The POV shows Geordi's view as he stops in front of  
                   a mirror... wipes away the steam and reveals his own

                   Soran is working intently on the Launcher's Control

                   Forcefield. he's also still trying to engage Soran, 
                   find some way to get to him.
 PICARD                             What you're about to do is no 
                            different from when the Borg 
                            destroyed your world.

                   Soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and 
                   conversational.

 SORAN                             You're right. And there was a 
                            time when I wouldn't have hurt 
                            anyone. Then the Borg came... and 
                            they showed me that if there is 
                            one constant in this universe, 
                            it's death.

                            Afterwards, I began to realize 
                            that none of it mattered. We're 
                            all going to die anyway. It's 
                            only a question of how and when. 
                            You will too, Captain. You might 
                            contract a fatal disease... you 
                            might die in battle...

                   Soran now turns and fixes Picard with a penetrating 
                   look.

 SORAN                             ... or burn to death in a fire.

                   Picard freezes at this. Soran steps off the launcher 
                   with a confident look... he moves closer to where 
                   Picard is standing.

 SORAN                             You looked surprised. But you 
                            shouldn't be. I've been to the 
                            Nexus, Captain. I know things 
                            about people. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Aren't you beginning to feel time 
                            gaining on you? It's like a 
                            predator. It's stalking you. You 
                            can try to outrun it with 
                            doctors... medicines.new 
                            technologies... but in the end, 
                            time is going to hunt you down...
                            and make the kill.

                   This strikes home with Picard's own recent concerns...
                   he struggles for a moment.

 PICARD                             We're all. mortal, Soran. It's 
                            one of the truths of our 
                            existence.

 SORAN                             What if I told you I found a new 
                            truth...

 PICARD                             The Nexus.

 SORAN                             Time has no meaning there. The 
                            predator has no teeth.

                   Soran glances up at the sky expectantly, then turns 
                   away from Picard and goes back to work on the Launcher. 
                   OFF Picard's disturbed expression...

                   Picard continues to walk around the perimeter of the 
                   forcefield. He sees something on the ground -- a 
                   GNARLED ROOT from a large nearby tree. The root is 
                   poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through 
                   which daylight can be seen. Picard's mind begins 
                   racing... he glances at Soran and then picks up a 
                   pebble and, while keeping his eye on the root, he tosses 
                   the pebble into the air, where it HITS the forcefield. 

                   -- The forcefield FLASHES on briefly and Picard can see 
                      that the bottom border of the field follows the contour 
                      of the root. But it does not extend underneath the arch. 

                   -- Soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.

 SORAN                             Careful, Captain. That's a fifty 
                            gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't 
                            want to see you get hurt.

 PICARD                             Thank you.

                   Soran returns to working on the Launcher. but Picard 
                   looks back down at the root... then walks away,

                   rounds a corner and enters Engineering.

                   Geordi is talking to an engineer named FARRELL, N.D.s

 FARRELL                             I'd like to run a Level Three

 GEORDI                             Okay, let's do it.

                   They both move to consoles...

                   As before. On the screen, we can now see several of the 
                   monitors in Engineering. On the left side of the 
                   screen is the large cutaway view of the Enterprise. 
                   Lursa suddenly reacts to something on the screen.

 LURSA                             That's it!

                   for a moment and then FREEZES. On the screen, we can 
                   see several of the monitors in Engineering. On the 
                   left side of the screen is the large cutaway view of 
                   the Enterprise. Lursa touches the diagram.

 LURSA                             Their shields are operating on a

                   The sisters exchange an excited glance, then move 
                   toward the command area.

 B'ETOR                                      (calls out)

                            Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic
                            pulse, it might reset the coil and 
                            engage the cloaking systems.

 WORF                                      (onto the idea)
                            As their cloak begins to engage, 
                            their shields will drop.

 RIKER                             Right. And they'll be vulnerable 
                            for at least two seconds.

                   Data goes to work.

 RIKER                             Worf, prepare a spread of photon

                            the instant they begin to cloak.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 RIKER                             We're only going to get one shot

                   root. It misses and BOUNCES off the FORCEFIELD. Soran 
                   looks over his shoulder at Picard, who sits down on a 
                   rock. Soran returns to his work. 

                   Picard tosses a second pebble -- this one also hits the 
                   forcefield. Soran turns with a vaguely irritated look.

 SORAN                                      (as if to a child)
                            Don't you have anything better to 
                            do?

                   Picard doesn't respond. Soran goes back to work.

                   Picard waits a moment, then takes aim and TOSSES
                   another pebble toward the root. This time, the pebble 
                   bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau -
                   inside the forcefield. Picard keeps his expression
                   neutral, but he's found a way in.

                   graphics and numbers ticking by -- obviously a 
                   countdown in progress. Soran finishes and turns off 
                   the control panel. He steps down and looks over at 
                   Picard, who is standing near the forcefield.

 SORAN                             Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,

                   toward the top of the rock face. Picard watches him

                   Picard has dropped to the ground and is on his back -
                   he's trying to wriggle underneath the root. It's not 
                   easy. he knows there's not much room between the 
                   ground and the invisible field. he just gets his head
                   and shoulders underneath when he accidentally TOUCHES the

                   as he blinks and tries to focus...

 154 PICARD'S POV 154 
                   As the room comes into focus. The first thing we see 
                   is an enormous, gaily decorated CHRISTMAS TREE
                   sparkling with hundreds of lights.

 155 REVEAL THE ROOM 155 
                   A 24th-century FRENCH LIVING ROOM. It is beautifully
                   decorated with lights, ornaments, holly. brightly 
                   wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas 
                   tree. There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in 
                   the room, all looking at Picard with bright, smiling 
                   faces, waiting for him to say something.

                   Picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to 
                   react. Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we 
                   move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties 
                   standing next to Picard.

 WOMAN                              Go on... say something. They're 
                             waiting.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              I... don't know what to say...

                   One of the children, a young GIRL, speaks up.

 GIRL                              Say Merry Christmas, Papa!

 PICARD                                      (in a daze)
                             Merry... Christmas...

                   The children break out into applause. The woman kisses 
                   him on the cheek, then steers him to a large, 
                   overstuffed chair. Picard sits down and the 
                   children starts handing out presents with much laughter 
                   and chatting.

 CHILDREN                              This one's for you... where's 
                             mine?... I hope this is the book 
                             I asked for... take this one to 
                             Papa...

                   As the activity swirls around him, Picard begins to 
                   feel an immense  sense of satisfaction and happiness. 
                   It's like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and 
                   contentment fills Picard. It's a wondrous experience. 
                   He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across 
                   his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even 
                   want to understand at the moment, he is very, very 
                   happy.
 GIRL                                      (to Picard)
                             Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?

                   Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in 
                   the world.

 PICARD                              Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly 
                             beautiful. All of it.

                   All of the children now crowd around the chair with a 
                   single large gift and hand it to Picard. One of the 
                   younger boys speaks up.

 YOUNG BOY                              This is from all of us.

 PICARD                              Thank you... I can't imagine what 
                             it is.

                   Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century 
                   SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational 
                   instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and 
                   gleaming brass.

 YOUNG BOY                                      (excited)
                             It's a sack-tent!

                   Picard eyes it with delight.

 PICARD                              You mean a sextant. And it's a 
                             handsome one at that... from about 
                             eighteen twenty, I'd say. 
                             Wherever did you find it?

 GIRL                              It's a secret.

 PICARD                                      (smiles)
                             Oh, a secret... well, that makes 
                             it a doubly special gift. Thank 
                             you... thank you all...

                   The children react with pleasure. They cluster around 
                   him, showering him with hugs and kisses.

 CHILDREN                              Merry Christmas, Papa... I love 
                             You, Father... etc.

                   Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection. 
                   The children pull back and return to their own 
                   presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion 
                   as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played 
                   out.

 WOMAN                                      (to Picard)
                             I'll go get dinner ready.
                             they'll be starving in a minute.

                   Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks 
                   around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.

                   The children continue to chatter and laugh among 
                   themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious 
                   Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks 
                   over the ornaments and decorations...

 156 PICARD'S POV 156 
                   of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of 
                   color and light.

 157 PICARD 157 
                   His eye is caught by something in particular on the 
                   tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it.

 158 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 158 
                   His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the 
                   top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass 
                   ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a 
                   star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT...
                   and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands 
                   outward into the glass sphere.

                   It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is 
                   reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the 
                   movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way 
                   the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many 
                   ornaments on the tree.

 159 PICARD 159 
                   reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve 
                   within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something 
                   he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an 
                   otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the 
                   reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it 
                   aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands 
                   and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby 
                   window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow 
                   soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.

 160 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 160                    reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the 
                   ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes 
                   that this image is not going to go away... he can't 
                   hide from it.

 PICARD                              No... this isn't right... this 
                             can't be real...

 GUINAN'S VOICE                              It's as real as you want it to be.

                   Picard turns to see

 161 GUINAN (VFX-P) 161 
                   standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit 
                   seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B. 
                   As they talk, the children and the woman continue to 
                   move about their business as if Picard and Guinan 
                   aren't there.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              Guinan... what's going on? Where 
                             am I?

 GUINAN                              You're in the Nexus.

                   Picard looks around.

 PICARD                              This... is the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              For you. This is where you wanted 
                             to be...

 PICARD                              But I never had a wife, children, 
                             a home like this...

 GUINAN                              Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...

                   Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on 
                   Guinan.

 PICARD                              Guinan, what are you doing here? 
                             I thought you were on the 
                             Enterprise.
 GUINAN                              I am on the Enterprise...I am 
                             also here. 
                                     (off his puzzled look) 
                             Think of me as... an "echo" of the 
                             person you know... a part of her
                             she left behind...

 PICARD                              Left behind...?

 GUINAN                              When the Enterprise-B beamed us 
                             off the Lakul, we were partially 
                             in the Nexus. The transporters 
                             locked on to us... but somehow 
                             everyone left a part of themselves 
                             behind.

 PICARD                              Soran...?

 GUINAN                              All of us.

 PICARD                              Where is he now?

 GUINAN                              Wherever he wanted to be...

                   Guinan smiles at him.

 BOY'S VOICE                              Papa, help me build my castle!

                   Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play 
                   castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego". 
                   For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the 
                   warm embrace of the fantasy...

 PICARD                                      (to boy)
                             In a few minutes...

                   Picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay 
                   here becoming more powerful.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, awed, to 
                                      Guinan)
                             These are my children... my 
                             children...

 GUINAN                                      (smiles)
                             Yeah. They're great, aren't they? 
                             You can go back and see them 
                             born... go forward and see your 
                             grandchildren... time has no
                             meaning here.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Dinner's ready! Let's go!

                   There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. 
                   The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and 
                   takes his hand.

 BOY                              Papa... are you coming?

                   Picard looks down into the face of his child. His 
                   heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this 
                   out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few 
                   steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye 
                   is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a 
                   moment... torn between the two images. and then, in 
                   one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends 
                   down to the child...

 PICARD                              Go on... go on without me...

                   The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then 
                   obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room 
                   to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to 
                   steel his voice.

 PICARD                              Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              Why would you want to leave?

 PICARD                                      (insistent)
                             Can I?

 GUINAN                              Yes... where would you go?

 PICARD                              I don't understand.

 GUINAN                              I told you, time has no meaning 
                             here. If you leave, you can go 
                             anywhere... any time.

                   Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
 PICARD                              I know exactly where I want to 
                             go... and when. Back to that 
                             mountaintop on Veridian Three...
                             before Soran put out the star. I 
                             have to stop him.

 GUINAN                              What makes you think things will 
                             be any different this time?

 PICARD                              You're right. I'll need help. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Guinan, will you come back with 
                             me? Together, we could --

 GUINAN                              I can't leave. I'm already there, 
                             remember?

                   Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives 
                   him an enigmatic smile.

 GUINAN                              I know just the guy.

                   Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen. 
                   Picard turns at the sound --

 162 EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY 162 
                   Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but
                   Architecturally striking house with spectacular views 
                   in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead, 
                   making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
                   cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is 
                   just starting to adjust to this sudden change in 
                   location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
                   from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to 
                   look around the corner and sees -

                   James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks 
                   exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the  
                   Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is 
                   vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying 
                   himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
                   labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's 
                   no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard 
                   recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
                   Century Starfleet officer.

 PICARD                              James Kirk.

                   Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. 
                   His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in    
                   Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the 
                   sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's
                   over-powered him.

 KIRK                              Beautiful day, isn't it?

 PICARD                              Yes... yes, it is.

                   Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.

 KIRK                              Do you mind?

                   It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk 
                   wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.

 PICARD                              Oh.

                   Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a 
                   vigorous chop with the axe.

 PICARD                              Captain, do you realize what --

                   But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.

 KIRK                              Wait a second. I think 
                             something's burning.

                   Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of 
                   one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the 
                   house, and Picard follows...

 163 INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 163 
                   Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century 
                   with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an 
                   antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles 
                   and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the 
                   doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some 
                   stranger's house.

                   Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. 
                   It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, 
                   waves the smoke away with his hand. 

 KIRK                              Looks like someone was cooking 
                             eggs... 
                                     (to Picard) 
                             Come on in, it's all right. This 
                             is my house -- or at least it used 
                             to be, I sold it years ago.

                   Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's 
                   going on.

 PICARD                              I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the 
                             starship Enterprise.

                   Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK
                   on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves 
                   to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and 
                   wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning 
                   to connect with things and memories from his past.

 KIRK                              This clock... I gave this clock to 
                             Bones...

 PICARD                                      (pressing on)
                             I'm from what you would consider 
                             the future... the twenty-fourth
                             century.

                   Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in 
                   his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and 
                   sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both 
                   look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets 
                   Kirk with enthusiasm.

 KIRK                                      (affectionately)
                             Jake! Jake, you miserable old 
                             Mutt... How can you be here? 
                                     (to Picard)
                             He's been dead seven years.

                   Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we 
                   hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that 
                   stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see 
                   the shock on Kirk's face.

 ANTONIA'S VOICE                              Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How 
                             long are you going to be rattling 
                             around that kitchen?

                   A beat.

 KIRK                                      (amazed)
                             That's Antonia...

                   Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to 
                   realize something.

 KIRK                              Wait a minute...

                   Kirk glances at Picard.

 KIRK                              The future... what are you 
                             talking about? This is the 
                             past...

                   Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a 
                   HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This 
                   confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.

 KIRK                              This is nine years ago... the day 
                             I told her I was going back to
                             Starfleet...

                   Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by 
                   memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the 
                   frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden 
                   burst of recognition.

 KIRK                              These were Ktarian eggs -- her 
                             favorite.I was cooking them to 
                             soften the blow... 
                                     (re: horseshoe) 
                             And I gave her this.

                   Picard steps in.

 PICARD                              I know how real this must seem to 
                             you, but it's not. This isn't 
                             Really your house. We've both   
                             been caught up in some sort of 
                             temporal nexus.

                   But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being 
                   swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the
                   opportunity he suddenly has.

 KIRK                              Dill weed.

                   Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to 
                   it.

 KIRK                              There's a bottle of dill weed on 
                             the second shelf to the left, 
                             right behind the nutmeg.

                   Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. 
                   He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins  
                   preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then 
                   goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it 
                   to Kirk.

 PICARD                              How long have you been here?

                   Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.

 KIRK                              I don't know. I was on the 
                             Enterprise-B... in the deflector 
                             control room... keep stirring 
                             these, will you?

                   Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a    
                   breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, 
                   but stirs the eggs anyway.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             The bulkhead in front of me 
                             Disappeared... then I was out 
                             there chopping wood. 
                                     (back to stove) 
                             Thanks.

                   Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.

 PICARD                              History records that you died 
                             saving the Enterprise-B from an 
                             energy ribbon eighty years ago...

                   But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is  
                   Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a
                   distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the 
                   plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
                   tray.

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             So you're telling me this is the 
                             twenty-fourth century... and I'm 
                             dead?
 PICARD                              Not exactly. As I said, this is 
                             some kind of...

 KIRK                              Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you. 
                                     (frowns at tray) 
                             Something's missing...

                   Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- 
                   as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins 
                   and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the 
                   tray and heads for the door.

 PICARD                              Captain, I need your help. I want 
                             you to leave the Nexus with me.

                   Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...

 164 INT. KIRK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 164 
                   Kirk and Picard both on the move. Kirk heading for a 
                   staircase.

 PICARD                              We have to go back to a planet 
                             called Veridian III and stop a 
                             man from destroying a star. There 
                             are millions of lives at stake.

                   Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go 
                   away.

 KIRK                              You said history considers me 
                             dead. Who am I to argue with 
                             history?

 PICARD                              You're a Starfleet Officer and you 
                             have a duty to --

 KIRK                                      (hard)
                             I don't need to be lectured by 
                             you. I was out saving the galaxy 
                             when your grandfather was still in 
                             diapers. And frankly, I think the 
                             galaxy owes me one 
                                     (beat) 
                             I was like you once... so worried 
                             about duty and obligations that I 
                             couldn't see anything past this 
                             uniform. And in the end, what did 
                             it get me? Nothing. Not this 
                             time.

                   Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the 
                   stairs.

 KIRK                                      (looking up the stairs)
                             I'm going to walk up these stairs, 
                             march into that bedroom and tell
                             Antonia that I want to marry her.

                   Kirk begins to climb the stairs.

 KIRK                               This time things are going to be 
                              different.

                   He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind 
                   him. Picard glances around the room in frustration, 
                   then gets a determined look on his face and marches up 
                   the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it 
                   and steps through the door into

 165 INT. BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 165 
                   Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway 
                   of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm 
                   implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in 
                   through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with 
                   a few horses visible. 

                   Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks 
                   surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the
                   tray of food.

 PICARD                                      (re: barn)
                             This doesn't look like your 
                             bedroom.

                   Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to 
                   fall into place. He smiles with a growing 
                   realization...

 KIRK                              No... no, it's not. It's better.

 PICARD                              Better?

 KIRK                              This is my uncle's barn in Iowa...

                   He points to a horse with a saddle on it.

 KIRK                                      (re: horse)
                             I took that horse out for a ride 
                             seven years ago... on a spring 
                             day.

                   Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a  
                   beautiful spring day.
 KIRK                              Just like this. If I'm right, 
                             this is the day I met Antonia.

                   He turns to Picard.

 KIRK                              This Nexus of yours is very 
                             clever. I can start all over 
                             again -- do things right from day 
                             one.

                   Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and 
                   rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard 
                   watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the 
                   other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and
                   then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...
 CUT TO: 
 166 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (VFX-P) 166 
                   Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
                   and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and 
                   finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large 
                   RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He 
                   spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse 
                   is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the 
                   precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
                    Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse 
                   on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come 
                   over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. 
                   Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...
                   and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a 
                   moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the 
                   ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something 
                   about that jump is nagging at him...

                   He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. 
                   The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the  
                   ravine. 

                   Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the 
                   horse makes the LEAP across yet again.

                   This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an   
                   immediate stop. We can see on his face that something 
                   is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with 
                   a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.

                   In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a 
                   horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a 
                   long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by 
                   side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
                   feelings...

 KIRK                                      (re: ravine)
                             I must have made this jump fifty 
                             times. and every time it scared 
                             the hell out of me. But not this 
                             time.
                                     (beat) 
                             Because... it's not real.

                   A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular 
                   hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the 
                   bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see 
                   the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.
 PICARD                                      (re: woman)
                             Antonia?

 KIRK                                      (nods)
                             She's not real either, is she? 
                             Nothing here is... nothing here 
                             matters...

                   All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of 
                   self-revelation. He glances around.

 KIRK                              It's kinda like... orbital 
                             skydiving. Exciting for a few 
                             minutes... but in the end, you 
                             haven't really done anything...
                             you haven't made a difference...

                   Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, 
                   he's truly seeing him for the first time.

 KIRK                              Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              Close to retirement?

 PICARD                              I hadn't planned on it.

                   There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't 
                   seen until now.

 KIRK                              Well, let me tell you something - 
                             don't. Don't let them promote 
                             you... don't let them transfer 
                             you... don't let anything take you 
                             off the Bridge of that ship... 
                                     (beat) 
                             Because while you're there, you 
                             can make a difference.

                   The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard 
                   hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the 
                   whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there 
                   is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and  
                   determination.

 PICARD                              You don't need to be on the Bridge 
                             of a starship. Come with me. 
                             Help me stop Soran. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Make a difference again.

                   A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly,  
                   unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.

 KIRK                              How can I argue with the Captain 
                             of the Enterprise? 
                                     (a beat)
                             What was the name of that 
                             Planet... Veridian III?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              I take it the odds are against us,
                             and the situation is grim?

 PICARD                              You could say that.

 KIRK                                      (musing)
                             Of course, if Spock were here, 
                             he'd say I was being an 
                             irrational, illogical human for 
                             wanting to go on a mission like 
                             that...

                   And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his 
                   eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.

 KIRK                              Sounds like fun.

                   The two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as 
                   they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE
                   SCREEN, as seen before.

 FADE TO RED 
 FADE IN: 
 167 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P) 167 
                   Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing 
                   Picard.

 SORAN                              Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, 
                             I have an appointment with 
                             Eternity and I don't want to be 
                             late.

                   We realize we are watching the same events play out 
                   again.

                   Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding 
                   toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the 
                   ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath 
                   the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the 
                   field...

 167A SORAN (VFX-P) 167A 
                   turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then 
                   draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard.

 167B THE GROUND (VFX-P) 167B 
                   is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, 
                   obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily.

                    -- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his  
                       hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived. 

                   Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris.
                     -- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with
                       several feet of the ground where he was crawling.

 167C SORAN (VFX-I) 167C 
                   Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON,
                   then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT
                   kicks him in the head.

 168 REVEAL KIRK 168 
                   who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men 
                   begin to fight.

 169 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 169 
                   as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up 
                   onto the control platform and desperately begins trying 
                   to shut down the launcher...

                   The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.

                   -- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense 
                      of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is 
                      bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and 
                      alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues 
                      to race by.

 169A THE SKY (VFX-I) 169A 
                   the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...

 169B THE MOUNTAINTOP 169B 
                   Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it 
                   to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon...

                   -- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. 
                      Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting 
                      buttons...looking for other control panels, anything 
                      to affect the launcher.

 169C ANGLE (VFX-P) 169C 
                   Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the 
                   screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in 
                   the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR.

 169D PICARD (VFX-P) 169D 
                   begins working the control panel... desperate... he 
                   looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the 
                   probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is 
                   left standing on an invisible platform three feet in 
                   the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to 
                   do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of 
                   the controls.

                   -- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. 
                      Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk 
                      stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back 
                      in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the
                      movie.

 PICARD                                      (desperate)
                             Kirk -- there's a control PADD in 
                             his right pocket!

 169E KIRK (VFX-P) 169E                    sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, 
                   pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He 
                   begins working it...

 170 CLOSE ON SORAN 170                    His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks 
                   around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet 
                   away, just beyond his reach...

 171 THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P) 171 
                   Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.

 171A KIRK (VFX-P) 171A 
                   he smiles.

 KIRK                              The twenty-fourth century isn't so 
                             tough.

                   Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from 
                   behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor 
                   in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the 
                   weapon at Picard.

 172 MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE 172 
                   The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame. 
                   Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs 
                   into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads 
                   toward the sun...

 172A THE PROBE (VFX-I) 172A 
                   makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down 
                   toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the 
                   probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We 
                   hear a muffled explosion.

 172B SORAN (VFX-I) 172B 
                   can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks 
                   into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking 
                   overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he 
                   rushes to the top of the scaffolding.
 173 PICARD 173 
                   moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes 
                   flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly 
                   wounded.

 174 SORAN (VFX-I) 174 
                   is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward 
                   the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare
                   hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.

 SORAN                              No...

                   His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns 
                   to Picard.

 SORAN YOU!! 
 174B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 174B 
                   He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the 
                   scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He 
                   GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES
 SORAN IN MID-AIR . 
                   Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. 
                   The pocket watch has been shattered.

 175 PICARD 175 
                   turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his 
                   lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged 
                   breath.

 KIRK                              Nice shot.

                   Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.

 PICARD                              I'll find a way to contact the 
                             Enterprise. You're going to be 
                             all right.

 KIRK                              Did we do it? Did we make a 
                             Difference...?

 PICARD                              Yes. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Thank you.

 KIRK                              Least I could do...for a Captain 
                             of the Enterprise.

                   Kirk coughs again

 PICARD                              Try to hang on.
                    Kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his 
                   face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his 
                   face

 KIRK                              It was fun.

                   Kirk dies.

                   Hold te scene for a long moment, the two men in the 
                   quiet clearing.

 DISSOLVE TO: 
 176 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET 176 
                   Close on Picard's hand

                   as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones. 
                   MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few 
                   rocks on Kirk's grave.

                   He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command
                   insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave...
                   and stands there silently for a few moments.

                   A distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks 
                   up into the sky...

 177 PICARD'S POV (VFX-I) 177 
                   An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky 
                   toward the mountaintop.

 178 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET 178 
                   The shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as 
                   Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D. 
                   security guards jump out to meet him.

 WORF                              Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 LA FORGE                              What about Doctor Soran?

 PICARD                              You needn't worry about the Doctor 
                             anymore.

                   Picard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he 
                   notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and 
                   notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on 
                   his face and Worf's uniform is torn.

 PICARD                              Was there a problem with the 
                             Klingons?

                   Worf and La Forge exchange a look.

 GEORDI                              You could say that...

                             The starship Farragut has arrived in
                             orbit and has begun to beam up 
                             the Enterprise survivors for transport 
                             back to Earth.

 180 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - DAY 180 
                   A hive of activity -- Crewmembers moving about, 
                   carrying personal effects, equipment, etc. Some 
                   wounded people being carried on stretchers...

                   The corridor is lit by emergency beacons and a HATCH
                   has been opened at one end of the Corridor leading to 
                   the exterior of the ship. Daylight and jungle can be
                   seen outside.

 PICARD (V.O.)                                      (continuing)
                             Our casualties were light. but
                             unfortunately the Enterprise
                             herself cannot be salvaged.

                   Injured crewmember into the arms of a waiting Medical
                   N.D. Ogawa walks up to her

 OGAWA                              That should be the last of the wounded, 
                             Doctor.

                   Beverly nods. She looks exhausted.

 BEVERLY                              Two hundred thirty-two patients in

                   Two medical N.D.s walk past, carrying an empty 
                   stretcher. Beverly glances at them.

 BEVERLY                                      (calls out)
                             Save that stretcher...

 OGAWA                              Is there another patient?

 BEVERLY                              No -- that one's for me.

 181 INT. ANOTHER LOCATION 181 
                   Data and Troi are looking through rubble in a different 
                   section of the ship with tricorders. Troi reacts to 
                   something on the tricorder.

 TROI                              Over here, Data! I think I've 
                             found something.

                   Data moves to her, with a hopeful and excited look.

 TROI                                      (off tricorder)
                             One life sign, very faint.

                   Data hands his tricorder to Troi and then begins to 
                   pull debris aside with android strength.

 DATA                                      (relieved)
                             Spot.

                   He picks up the cat and holds it close, stroking its 
                   fur. The cat purrs happily.

 DATA                              I am very happy to find you, Spot.

                   Troi smiles.

 TROI                              Another family reunited.

                   Data turns, revealing that there are tears in his eyes. 
                   Troi is surprised and touched at the sight.

 TROI                              Data... are you all right?

 DATA                              I am not sure, Counselor. I am 
                             happy to see Spot... and yet I am 
                             crying. My emotional program must 
                             be malfunctioning again.

                   Troi puts a gentle hand on him.

 TROI                              No, Data... I think it's working 
                             perfectly.

                   Data looks up at her and smiles through his tears. OFF

 183 INT. READY ROOM - DAY 183 
                   Picard and Riker are sifting through the rubble of what 
                   once was the Ready Room, looking for something...

                   Riker sees something in the rubble.

 RIKER                              Is this it?

                   Riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier.

 PICARD                                      (relieved)
                             Yes, Number One. Thank you.

                   He takes the album... brushes off the dust and flips 
                   through the pages for a moment. Riker looks around the  
                   wrecked room.

 RIKER                              I'm going to miss this ship. She 
                             went before her time.

                   Picard has been rejuvenated by his experience... given 
                   a new perspective on the issues of life and death.

 PICARD                              It's not how many years you've 
                             lived, Wil... but how you've lived 
                             them.
                                     (beat) 
                             Someone once told me that time is 
                             a predator that stalks us all our 
                             lives. But maybe time is also a 
                             companion who goes with us on 
                             our journey, and reminds us to 
                             cherish the moments of our 
                             lives... because they will never 
                             come again.

                             We are after all. only mortal.

                   A quiet moment... Riker finally smiles.

 RIKER                              Speak for yourself, sir. I kinda 
                             planned on living forever.

                   Picard smiles back at him and the two men EXIT to...

 184 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P) 184 
                   Riker and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room. They look 
                   around the wrecked Bridge for a moment. Riker glances 
                   at the captain's chair.

 RIKER                              I always thought I'd have a crack 
                             at this chair one day.

 PICARD                              You may still... somehow I doubt 
                             this will be the last ship to 
                             carry the name Enterprise.

                   A beat, then Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, to com)
                             Picard to Farragut. Two to beam 
                             up.

                   The two men dematerialize.

 FADE IN: 
 1 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 1 
                   A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT 
                   appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small 
                   and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end, 
                   but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...

 2 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 2 
                   A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware 
                   that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of 
                   wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the 
                   sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their
                   conversation...and we can see that the two men are 
                   SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.

 CHEKOV                                      (points to sky)
                             There he is -- there, to the 
                             South!

 SCOTTY                                      (peers upward)
                             What are ye, blind? That's a 
                             bird.

                   As they stare up at the sky...

 3 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 3 
                   The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and 
                   we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it 
                   is tumbling directly toward the camera...

 4 EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY 4 
                   As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.

 SCOTTY                                      (concerned)
                             Repelling the Crystalline 
                             Trench... rafting down lava 
                             flows... orbital skydiving. it's 
                             like the man is running a bloody 
                             decathlon across the galaxy.

                   Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.

 CHEKOV                                      (re: sound)
                             That should be him now. I think 
                             he's just crossed the sound 
                             barrier.

                   They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.

 5 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 5 
                   The bottle gets CLOSER...

 6 EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6 
                   A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS 
                   in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is 
                   charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of
                   it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack 
                   and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man 
                   removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He 
                   smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
                   roller-coaster.

 KIRK                              Right on target! I jump out over 
                             the Arabian Peninsula... and I end 
                             up here, right on the dime.

                   Kirk gets to his feet.

 CHEKOV                              Actually, Captain, your precise 
                             target area was thirty-five 
                             meters...
                                     (points)
                             That way.
 KIRK                              Thanks for pointing that out.

                   Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden 
                   pain in his back.

 KIRK                              Oh...

 SCOTTY                              I've warned ye about that back of 
                             yours. You should have a doctor 
                             take a look at it.

                   Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his 
                   harness.

 6A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 6A 
                   The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see 
                   that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265. 
                   Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...

 6B EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY 6B                    Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.

 KIRK                              Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
                             elliptical jump. That's where you 
                             jump out over Northern China, and 
                             make three complete orbits before 
                             you start re-entry...

 CHEKOV                              Captain. Perhaps you have 
                             forgotten that tomorrow is the 
                             christening ceremony.

                   This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
                   hesitation and irritation cross his face.

 KIRK                              I'm not going.
                                     (beat) 
                             Scotty, help me with this chute.

 SCOTTY                              What do you mean, you're not 
                             going? We promised.

 KIRK                              When I retired, I swore I'd never 
                             set foot on a starship again, and 
                             I meant it.

 CHEKOV                              Captain...

 KIRK                                      (firm)
                             I don't want to hear anymore about 
                             it. I'm not going, and that's 
                             final.

 7 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7 
                   The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a 
                   Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its 
                   dock in orbit around Earth.

 7A EXT. SPACE (VFX-I) 7A 
                   FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they 
                   spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull: 
 U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B. 
 8 ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW 8 
                   A large picture window overlooking the starship in its 
                   berth. The window is filled with people in Starfleet 
                   uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but 
                   we hear nothing).

 8A INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I) 8A                    The people are still applauding and we can see that 
                   they are looking out over the ship in its berth.

 8B EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I) 8B 
                   The great ship sits in spacedock.

 9 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 9 
                   CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to 
                   reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines 
                   into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL -
                   that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
                   CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The 
                   camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is 
                   worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS 
                   clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated 
                   with the camera, the others using PADDS to make 
                   notations.

                   Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of 
                   the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and 
                   the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the
                   Bridge.

 JOURNALISTS                                      (overlapping)
                             Captain Kirk, how does it feel 
                             to be back on the Enterprise 
                             Bridge... Captain, can I have a 
                             Minute... Captain Scott, do you 
                             have any comment on... Commander
                             Chekov... etc.

                   CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, excuse me...there will 
                             be plenty of time for questions
                             later...

                   The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to 
                   get a good angle.

 HARRIMAN                                      (continuing, to all)
                             I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd 
                             like to welcome you all aboard.

 KIRK                              It's our pleasure.

                   Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his 
                   first command and he takes it very seriously.

 HARRIMAN                              I just want you to know how 
                             excited we all are to have a group 
                             of living legends with us on our 
                             maiden voyage. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I remember reading about your 
                             missions when I was in grade 
                             school.

                   The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him 
                   a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he 
                   didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a
                   little smile, lets it roll off. 
 KIRK                              Well... may we have a look around?

 HARRIMAN                              Please... please.

                   Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to 
                   her.

 CHEKOV                              Demora!

                   Chekov moves off.

 JOURNALIST                                      (breezy)
                             So, Captain... this is the first 
                             Starship Enterprise in thirty 
                             years without James T. Kirk in 
                             command. How do you feel about 
                             that?

                   The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's 
                   eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this 
                   Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about 
                   it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
 KIRK                              Just fine. I'm glad to be here to 
                             send her on her way...

                   He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs 
                   him.

 JOURNALIST                              What have you been doing since you 
                             retired?

 KIRK                              I've been... keeping busy.

                   At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid-
                   twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.

 CHEKOV                                      (to Kirk)
                             Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you 
                             to meet the Helmsman of the
                             Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu --
                             Captain James Kirk.

 DEMORA                              It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. 
                             My father's told me some...
                             interesting stories about you.

                   Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her 
                   in amazement.

 KIRK                              Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your 
                             father?

 DEMORA                              Yes, sir.

 CHEKOV                              You met her once before, but she 
                             was...

                   Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short 
                   height.

 KIRK                              But that wasn't so long ago... it 
                             couldn't have been more than...

 CHEKOV                              Twelve years, sir.

 KIRK                              Yes... well... congratulations, 
                             Ensign. It wouldn't be the 
                             Enterprise without a Sulu at the 
                             helm.

 DEMORA                              Thank you, sir. 
                                      (to Chekov) 
                             Let me show you the new inertial 
                             guidance system.

                   Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them 
                   for a long beat. The expression on his face changes 
                   from shock to sadness... Something is clearly 
                   bothering him. 

                   Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.

 SCOTTY                                      (to Kirk)
                             Damn fine ship if you ask me...

                   But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as 
                   she moves to the Helmsman's position.

 KIRK                              You know, Scotty... it amazes me.

 SCOTTY                              And what would that be, sir?

 KIRK                              Sulu. When did he find the time 
                             for a family?

 SCOTTY                              It's like you always said -- if 
                             something's important enough, you 
                             make the time.

                   Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...

 SCOTTY                              So... that's why you've been 
                             running around the galaxy like an
                             eighteen-year-old. Finding 
                             retirement a little lonely, are we?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 KIRK                              With that kind of tact, I'm glad 
                             you're an engineer and not a
                             psychiatrist.

                   Harriman interrupts.

 HARRIMAN                              Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll 
                             take your seats.

 KIRK                              Oh... of course.

 10 NEW ANGLE 10 
                   Revealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged 
                   to one side.

                   Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The 
                   Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the 
                   Bridge. Harriman moves to the command chair and the 
                   rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to all)
                             Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft 
                             thrusters ahead one quarter, port 
                             and starboard at station keeping. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if 
                             you would give the order to get 
                             underway.

 KIRK                              No... no. Thank you.

 HARRIMAN                              Please, I insist.

                   All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice. He stands 
                   uncomfortably. There is a moment of anticipation.

 KIRK                                      (to all)
                             Take us out.

                   Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE. Kirk sits down in 
                   acute embarrassment and  annoyance.

 CHEKOV                                      (sotto)
                             Very good, sir.

 SCOTTY                                      (sotto)
                             Brought a tear to my eye.

 CUT TO: 11 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 11 
                   The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads 
                   out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.

 12 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 12 
                   A short time later. Harriman turns to his guests.

 HARRIMAN                              Well... we've just cleared the 
                             asteroid belt. Our course will 
                             take us out beyond Pluto and then 
                             back to spacedock. Just a quick 
                             run around the block. 
                                     (beat) 
                             If we have time, we'll conduct a 
                             few tests of the warp --

                   Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP. 
                   The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.

 COM OFFICER                                      (to Harriman)
                             We're picking up a distress call, 
                             Captain.

                   This grabs everyone's attention.

 HARRIMAN                              On speakers.

                   We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked 
                   and urgent.

 COM VOICE                                      (fritzed)
                             This is the transport ship Lakul. 
                             We're caught in some kind of
                             energy distortion. We can't break 
                             free... need immediate help... 
                             It' tearing us --

                   The voice is drowned out by STATIC. The SCIENCE 
                   OFFICER checks something on his console. The 
                   Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and 
                   pans it around to capture the action.

 SCIENCE OFFICER                              The Lakul is one of two ships 
                             transporting El-Aurian refugees to 
                             Earth.

                   Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this 
                   unexpected turn of  events. Kirk watches him intently. 
                   Harriman clears his throat, then turns to Demora.

 HARRIMAN                              Can you locate them?

 DEMORA                              The ships are bearing at three one
                             zero mark two one five. Distance:
                             Three light years.

 HARRIMAN                              Signal the closest starship. 
                             We're in no condition to mount a 
                             rescue... We don't even have a 
                             full crew aboard.

                   The NAVIGATOR checks his console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're the only one in range, sir.

                   The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he 
                   shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk 
                   is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. 
                   Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his 
                   jacket a bit.

 HARRIMAN                              Well, then... I guess it's up to 
                             us. 
                                      (to Demora) 
                             Helm, lay in an intercept course 
                             and engage at maximum warp.

                   Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the 
                   action - his instincts taking over. Scotty shoots him 
                   a side-long glance.

 SCOTTY                              Is there something wrong with your 
                             chair, Captain?

                   Kirk gives him a look.

 13 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 13 
                   The ship snaps into warp.
 14 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 14 
                   A few minutes later. Demora is watching her console.

 DEMORA                              We're within visual range of the 
                             energy distortion, Captain.

 HARRIMAN                              On screen.

 15 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15 
                   Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY 
                   directly ahead of the Enterprise-B. 

                   Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.

 CHEKOV                              What the hell is that?

 DEMORA                                      (off console)
                             I've found the transport ships.

 15A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15A 
                   The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped 
                   like insects in the violent torrent of energy. The 
                   ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large 
                   TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY.

 DEMORA                                      (cont'd)
                             Their hulls are starting to buckle 
                             under the stress -- they won't 
                             survive much longer.

                   The ship suddenly SHAKES. The Navigator works his 
                   console.

 NAVIGATOR                              We're encountering severe 
                             gravimetric distortions from the 
                             energy ribbon.

 HARRIMAN                              We'll have to keep our distance...
                             we don't want to get pulled in
                             too...

                   Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out 
                   what to do. Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him 
                   the answer is obvious. He blurts out the answer --

 KIRK                              Tractor beam...

                   Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't 
                   Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up.  Harriman glances at Kirk.

 HARRIMAN                              We don't have a tractor beam.

 KIRK                              You left spacedock without a 
                             tractor beam?

 HARRIMAN                              It won't be installed until 
                             Tuesday. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Ensign Sulu... try generating a 
                             subspace field around the ships. 
                             That might break them free.

 DEMORA                              Aye, sir.

                   When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly 
                   and mouths the word "no" under his breath. He knows 
                   that won't work.

 DEMORA                                      (continuing; shakes her 
                                      head)
                             There's too much quantum 
                             interference, Captain.

                   Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another
                   solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in 
                   command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared. 
                   It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in 
                   On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair --
                   but he restrains himself.

 HARRIMAN                              What about... venting plasma from 
                             the warp nacelles? That might 
                             disrupt the ribbon's hold on the 
                             ships.

 NAVIGATOR                              Aye, sir.. releasing drive 
                             plasma...

                   A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the 
                   journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him 
                   a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he 
                   knows this is not the right course of action.

 NAVIGATOR                                      (continuing)
                             It's not having any effect, sir. 
                             I think --
 DEMORA                              Sir! The starboard vessel's hull 
                             is collapsing --
 15B INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I) 15B 
                   Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed 
                   by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES. The 
                   other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. 
                   Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.

 CHEKOV                              How many people were aboard 
                             that ship?

 DEMORA                              Two hundred sixty-five.

                   Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by 
                   the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at 
                   a genuine loss as to what to do next.

 DEMORA                                      (urgent)
                             The Lakul's hull integrity is down 
                             to twelve percent, sir.

                   Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet 
                   during this entire sequence only through great effort 
                   and out of deference to the young Captain. This is a 
                   delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look 
                   incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.

 HARRIMAN                              Captain Kirk... I would appreciate 
                             any... suggestions you might have.

                   Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. 
                   He moves down to stand next to Harriman.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             First -- move us within 
                             transporter range and beam those 
                             people to the Enterprise.

                   Harriman looks at him with surprise.

 HARRIMAN                              What about the gravimetric 
                             distortions? They'll tear us 
                             apart...

 KIRK                                      (gently)
                             Risk is part of the game if you 
                             want to sit in that chair.

                   Kirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles 
                   down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.

 HARRIMAN                              Helm, close to within transporter 
                             range.

                   Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the 
                   light on them  all.

 KIRK                              And second -- turn that damned 
                             thing off.

                   The cameraman turns OFF the light.

 CUT TO: 
 16 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 16 
                   The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. 
                   The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just 
                   missing it.

 17 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 17 
                   As before.

 DEMORA                              We're within range, sir.

 HARRIMAN                                      (to lieutenant)
                             Beam them directly to Sickbay.

 CHEKOV                                      (concerned)
                             How big's your medical staff?

 HARRIMAN                                      (embarrassed)
                             The medical staff... doesn't
                             arrive until Tuesday.

                   Chekov turns to the two journalists.

 CHEKOV                              You and you. You've just become 
                             nurses. Let's go.

                   Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.
 DEMORA                              Main Engineering reports 
                             fluctuations in the warp plasma 
                             relays.

 SCOTTY                              By-pass the relays and go to 
                             auxiliary systems.

                   The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console.

 LIEUTENANT                              Sir, I'm having trouble locking 
                             onto them. They appear to be...
                             in some sort of... temporal flux.

                   Kirk turns to Scotty.

 KIRK                              Scotty?

                   Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter 
                   console.

 SCOTTY                              What the hell...

                   Kirk moves to him.

 SCOTTY                              Their life signs are... are
                             phasing in and out of our 
                             space-time continuum.

 KIRK                              Phasing? To where?

                   Scotty begins to work.

 NAVIGATOR                              Sir! Their hull's collapsing!

 18 EXT. SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I) 18 
                   The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.

 19 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 19 
                   All eyes on Scotty.

 SCOTTY                              I got forty-seven of them...
                                     (beat, grim) 
                             ... out of one hundred fifty.

                   Suddenly the ship is rocked violently. KLAXONS and 
                   alarms start to wail and the lights FLICKER on and off. 
                   BULKHEAD EXPLODES, sending metal fragments screaming 
                   across the Bridge and KILLING the Navigator. Scotty 
                   quickly takes over the dead man's console.

 KIRK                              Report!

 DEMORA                              We're caught in a gravimetric 
                             field emanating from the trailing 
                             edge of the ribbon.

 HARRIMAN                              All engines, full reverse!

              20   EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B & RIBBON (VFX-I)                   20

                   The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the
                   ribbon, but cannot break away. It is clearly being 
                   pulled along, out of control. Tendrils leap up from the
                   ribbon, lashing against the ship.

 21 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY 21 
                   The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul. 
                   They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN  race -- humanoid 
                   and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are 
                   in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, 
                   staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, 
                   unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to 
                   themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from 
                   person to person trying to get control of the 
                   situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about. 
                   Chekov has a tricorder.

 SURVIVORS                                      (incoherent, overlapping)
                             The colors are touching me... I'm 
                             caught in the glass... Help me...
                             I can see the seconds... Over 
                             here... etc

 CHEKOV                              It will be all right. We're going 
                             to take care of you.

                   He looks at the tricorder.

 CHEKOV                                      (off tricorder)
                             Only minor injuries so far...
                                     (beat) 
                             But it looks like they're all
                             suffering from some kind of
                             neural shock.

                   One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed 
                   with a dazed look on his face. He has a nasty-looking 
                   wound on one side of his face. (We will later learn 
                   that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.)

                   The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly 
                   Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great 
                   Strength -- and pulls him close. Soran's eyes are 
                   suddenly wild, crazed.

 SORAN                              Why...why?

 JOURNALIST                              It's all right... you're safe...
                             you're on the Enterprise.

 SORAN                              No... I have to go... I have to 
                             get back... You don't understand! 
                             Let me go!

                   Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he 
                   can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a 
                   hypospray and Soran falls unconscious.

 JOURNALIST                              What was he talking about?

                   Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles 
                   nearby. Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her 
                   before she falls.

 CHEKOV                              Easy there...

                   The woman turns around and we see her face for the 
                   first time -- it's GUINAN. She seems dazed and 
                   confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.

 CHEKOV                              It's going to be okay. Here, just 
                             lie down.

                   As he guides Guinan onto a table...

                   Energy ribbon on viewscreen.

 DEMORA                              Inertial dampers failing.

 SCOTTY                              Engines not responding!

                   Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one 
                   hand. His face pales.

 HARRIMAN                                      (quiet)
                             I didn't expect to die my first 
                             day on the job.

                   Kirk tries to buck up the young captain.

 KIRK                                      (sotto)
                             The first thing you learn as 
                             Captain is how to cheat death. 
                                     (beat, then louder) 
                             Scotty?

 SCOTTY                                      (outraged)
                             There's just no way to disrupt a 
                             gravimetric field of this 
                             magnitude!

 DEMORA                              Hull integrity failing.

                   Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment.

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing)
                             But I do have a theory...

 KIRK                              I thought you might.

 SCOTTY                              An anti-matter discharge directly 
                             ahead... it might disrupt the 
                             field long enough for us to break 
                             away.

 KIRK                              A photon torpedo?

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 KIRK                                      (quickly, to Demora)
                             Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire 
                             on my command.

                   Demora turns to him.

 DEMORA                              Captain... we don't have any 
                             torpedoes.

                   Kirk glances at Harriman.

 KIRK                              Don't tell me... Tuesday.

                   Harriman nods, a little embarrassed. The SHAKING gets 
                   worse.

 SCOTTY                              Captain, it may be possible to 
                             simulate a torpedo blast using a
                             resonance burst from the main 
                             deflector dish.

 KIRK                                      (onto the idea)
                             Where are the deflector relays?

 DEMORA                              Deck fifteen, section twenty-one
                             alpha

 HARRIMAN                                      (to Kirk)
                             I'll go. You have the Bridge.

                   Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment 
                   as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship 
                   and sit in the Captain's chair one more time. But he 
                   pulls himself back before Harriman can exit.

 KIRK                              No... a Captain's place is on the 
                             Bridge of his ship. 
                                     (beat) 
                             I'll take care of it.

                   Harriman nods in acknowledgement. Kirk heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 KIRK                                      (on the move, to Scotty)
                             Keep her together until I get 
                             back.

 SCOTTY                                      (matter of fact)
                             I always do.

                   Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut...

                   A small control room with a few consoles. Kirk rushes 
                   in and rips off one of the large wall panels. He 
                   quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry...

                   As before. The ship is SHAKING badly.

 SCOTTY                              Captain, I don't know how much 
                             longer I can hold her together!

                   Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed.

 KIRK                              That's it. Go!

                             Activate main deflector.

                   Demora works the console.

 29 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 29 
                   A large BURST 0F ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector 
                   dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship. There is an 
                   immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon, which 
                   roils and fluctuates in response.

 30 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE 30 
                   As before.

 SCOTTY                              We're breaking free.

                   The ship now begins to turn away from the crackling 
                   ribbon. But just as it's turning, one final TENDRIL of 
                   energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship.

                   The ship is ROCKED so hard that everyone is knocked off 
                   their feet. Gradually, the SHAKING STOPS. Demora 
                   scrambles back into position.

 DEMORA                              We're clear.
                    Everyone reacts with relief.

 HARRIMAN                                      (excited, to com)
                             You did it, Kirk!

                             There's some buckling on the

                             Captain Kirk, please respond.

                   Still no response. Scotty's face falls.

 SCOTTY                                      (continuing, to Demora)
                             Have Chekov meet me on deck
                             fifteen.

                   Harriman, very concerned, gets up and follows Scotty. 
                   They EXIT to the Turbolift.

 CUT TO: 
 34 INT. ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR 34 
                   Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor. They round
                   a bend... and then stop short. They react to 
                   something ahead of them...

 35 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 35 
                   Revealing that the corridor ahead of them is GONE. A 
                   jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and OPEN SPACE 
                   can be seen beyond the twisted metal. 

                   A FORCEFIELD flickers on and off, holding the vacuum of 
                   space at bay.

                   Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a 
                   moment. Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind 
                   them. He stops and reacts.

 CHEKOV                              My God...

                             Was anyone in there?

                   A long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space.

 SCOTTY                              Aye.

 36 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I) 36 
                   A huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering 
                   section, looking like an open wound. Scotty, Chekov,
                   and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small 
                   Corridor, looking out into space...

 37 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE 37 
                   A short time later. Scotty, Harriman and Chekov are 
                   listening to Demora, who is working the Helm console.

 DEMORA                              I've checked the entire ship and 
                             the surrounding space. there's 
                             no sign of him.

                   A silent moment. Chekov looks to Scotty, hoping to 
                   hear some sort of miracle. Scotty takes a moment
                   looks at the empty command chair. Then he shakes his 
                   head. A long beat as everyone is forced to accept this
                   terrible truth.

 SCOTTY                                      (quiet)
                             Just a quick... run around the 
                             block.

 CHEKOV                              I never thought it would end like 
                             this...

 SCOTTY                              All things must end, Mr. Chekov.

                   Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge.

 HARRIMAN                              Let's go home.

                   Harriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes 
                   command of his ship.

                   Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look. Off the 
                   reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone 
                   very dear to them both...

 40 EXT. SAILING VESSEL - DAY 40 
                   A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about 
                   the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the 
                   water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we 
                   can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters.

 41 ON THE MAIN DECK 41 
                   Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the 
                   assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in 
                   full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with 
                   cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at 
                   attention... the wind whistles through the rigging...
                   the timbers creak...

                   Picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally  he
                   nods to Riker.

 RIKER                              Bring out the prisoner!

                   A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL.

 42 ON A HATCH 42 
                   as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is 
                   shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold 
                   him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain. 
                   The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at 
                   him closely.
 PICARD                              Mister Worf... I always knew this 
                             day would come. Are you prepared 
                             to face the charges?

                   Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.

 TROI                              Answer him!

 WORF                              I am prepared.

                   Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large, 
                   rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and 
                   begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes 
                   Worf's shackles.

 RIKER                              "We, the officers and crew of the 
                             U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound

                             knowingly and willfully perform

                             That he has been a good and solid

                             less twelve years. And Three. 
                             Most seriously... that he has 
                             earned the respect and admiration 
                             of the entire crew."

                   Riker puts away the scroll

 PICARD                              There can be only one punishment 
                             for such crimes...
                                     (beat) 
                             I hereby promote you to the rank 
                             of Lieutenant Commander, with all 
                             the rights and privileges thereto. 
                             And may God have mercy on your 
                             soul.

                   Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and
                   shakes his hand.

 PICARD                                      (cont'd)
                             Congratulations, Commander.

 WORF                                      (smiles)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then 
                   Riker steps in.

 RIKER                              Extend the plank!!

                   Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
                   and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is 
                   being pushed out over the water.

 CREWMEMBERS                              Into the sea with him... feed him 
                             to the sharks... walk the 
                             plank... etc.

                   Picard gives Riker a questioning look.

 PICARD                              Don't you think you're taking this 
                             a little too far, Number One?

 RIKER                              When we went to ancient Rome for 
                             Deanna's promotion, we threw her 
                             to the lions, remember?

                   Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of 
                   tea, but he'll go along with it.

                   Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting 
                   patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is 
                   put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike 
                   until Worf is nearly at the end.

                   Worf finally stops and turns around.

 WORF                                      (a shout)
 WAIT!! 
                   Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over 
                   the side at the water below.

 WORF                                      (a little embarrassed)
                             I can't swim.

 LA FORGE                                      (calmly, to Worf)
                             The Holodeck safety program is 
                             engaged... The computer won't let 
                             you drown.

 BEVERLY                              But the sharks are quite 
                             convincing.

                   Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
                   SEA  with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS. 
                   Reveal DATA, who is standing near the side rail, 
                   looking a little confused at the reaction.

 DATA                                      (to Beverly)
                             Doctor, I must confess I am 
                             uncertain as to why pushing 
                             someone into freezing, shark-
                             infested water is amusing.
 BEVERLY                              It's all done in good fun, Data. 
                             Get in the spirit of things.

 DATA                              Ah.

                   Data thinks a moment, then he LIFTS Beverly with one 
                   hand and hold her over the rail.

 BEVERLY                              Data...Data -- !

                   Data lets go and Beverly PLUMMETS into the ocean. Data 
                   looks around -- no one is laughing. They all look a 
                   little surprised.

 GEORDI                              Data. that wasn't funny.

                   Data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's 
                   more confused than ever.

 43 PICARD AND RIKER 43 
                   are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet Beverly 
                   comes up on deck.

 PICARD                              Well, now that we're all aboard...
                                     (beat, then smiles) 
                             Number One, bring the ship before 
                             the wind. 
                                     (savoring the moment) 
                             Let's see what's out there.

 RIKER                              Aye, aye, sir. 
                                     (to Troi) 
                             Take the wheel, Commander.

                   Troi takes the ship's wheel.

 RIKER                                      (shouts)
                             All hands make sail! Raise up 
                             tacks and stand by the braces!

                   The crew springs into action... rushing to their places 
                   aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines...
                   starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the 
                   yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail.

 46 PICARD AND RIKER 46 
                   Picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great 
                   satisfaction and  contentment.

 PICARD                              Imagine what it was like, Will. No 
                             engines... no computers... just 
                             the wind, the sea and the stars to 
                             guide you.

 RIKER                              Bad food, brutal discipline... 
                                     (beat) 
                             No women.

                   But Picard won't let Riker rain on his parade -- he's 
                   thoroughly enjoying himself.

 COM VOICE                              Bridge to Captain Picard.

 PICARD                              Picard here.

 COM VOICE                              There is a personal message for 
                             you from Earth.

 PICARD                                      (annoyed)
                             Put it through down here. 
                                     (to Riker) 
                             But the best thing about a life at 
                             sea was that they couldn't get to 
                             you.

                   Picard walks toward the bow.

 PICARD                                      (to com)
                             Computer, arch.

 46A ANGLE (VFX-P) 46A 
                   A U-shaped ARCH with several computer panels visible 
                   appears on the forecastle. It's a strange sight to see 
                   a piece of the 24th century on the deck of this ship. 
                   Picard goes to the arch and activates one of the 
                   monitors and waits for the transmission to appear.

 46B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 46B 
                   A text message APPEARS and he starts to read it. After 
                   a moment, he reacts with shock and dismay to something 
                   on the screen.

 47 ON TROI 47 
                   whose attention has been drawn to Picard, at the arch. 
                   She reacts with concern at the expression on his face.

 TROI                                       (to crewmember)
                             Here. Take the wheel.

                   Troi moves toward the bow.

 48 ON PICARD (VFX-P) 48 
                   whose face is now ashen with shock. Clearly he has 
                   just read something on the screen which is very 
                   disturbing. 

                   He stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi 
                   moves to him.

 TROI                                      (quiet)
                             Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse 
                             me...

                   He turns OFF the screen.

 PICARD                              Computer, exit.

 48A ANGLE (VFX-P) 48A 
                   The Holodeck DOORS APPEAR within the Arch. Picard is 
                   clearly distracted as he EXITS to the Corridor. Troi 
                   looks after him with concern.

 49 NEW ANGLE 49 
                   Favoring Riker. He takes a couple of steps toward 
                   Worf.

 RIKER                              Set the royals and the studding 
                             sails, Mister Worf.

                   Worf looks at him blankly for a moment.

 WORF                              The Royal... studs...?

 RIKER                                      (smiles, points aloft)
                             You see the top yardarm, now look 
                             to the --

                   Suddenly a com voice interrupts.

 COM VOICE                              Bridge to Commander Riker.

 RIKER                              Riker here.

 COM VOICE                              We're picking up a distress call 
                             from the Amargosa observatory, 
                             sir. They say they're under 
                             attack.

 RIKER                                       (to all)
                             Red Alert! All hands to 
                             Battle stations! Captain Picard to 
                             the Bridge.

                   Everyone on the ship reacts, and there is a general 
                   rush to the bow of the ship...

 CUT TO: 
 50 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-D (VFX-I) 50 
                   The great ship at impulse. We FOLLOW it and then see 
                   ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a 
                   complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch 
                   marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g.
                   a YELLOW SUN can be seen.)

 51 INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I) 51                    Picard in command. Riker, Troi, Worf and Data at their 
                   stations They didn't have time to change, so they are 
                   all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony. 
                   The ship is at Red Alert. The image of the burnt-out 
                   observatory is on the VIEWSCREEN.

 RIKER                              It looks like we're too late...

 WORF                                      (off console)
                             There are no other ships in the 
                             system.

 DATA                              Sensors show five life signs 
                             aboard the station, Captain.

 RIKER                              The station complement was 
                             nineteen.

                   A grim beat. Picard gets up and starts heading for the 
                   Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost 
                   irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern 
                   of his.

 PICARD                              Secure from Red Alert. Number 
                             One, begin an investigation. I'll 
                             be in my Ready Room.

                   Troi and Riker exchange a surprised look.

 RIKER                              Sir?

 PICARD                                      (hard)
                             Make it so.

                   Picard EXITS. An awkward beat. What's wrong with the 
                   Captain? But they have their orders. 

                   As Riker and  Worf head for the EXIT...

 CUT TO: 
 52 INT. OBSERVATORY - OPS CENTER (VFX-P) 52 
                   The station is a SMOKING RUIN -- consoles flickering, 
                   lights dim, damage everywhere. Only a few minutes have 
                   passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly
                   and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back 
                   in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has 
                   a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is 
                   cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out 
                   consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear 
                   view of the room.

 WORF                              These blast patterns are 
                             consistent with type-three 
                             disruptors.

 RIKER                              Well, that narrows it to Klingon, 
                             Breen or Romulan.

                   Beverly follows her tricorder readings.

 BEVERLY                              I'm picking up life signs... about 
                             twenty meters ahead.

 WORF                              That rules out Klingons.

                   Riker gives him a look.

 WORF                              They would not have left anyone 
                             alive.

 BEVERLY                              Over here.

                   They pick their way carefully through the carnage of 
                   the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet 
                   Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the 
                   back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his 
                   uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of 
                   her medical kit and begins to treat him.

 RIKER                              Worf, you're with me. Paskall, 
                             you and Mendez search the upper 
                             deck.

                   The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker 
                   and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops 
                   at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but 
                   they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far 
                   corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a 
                   collapsed bulkhead.

 WORF                              Under here...

                   They both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it 
                   aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a 
                   HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of 
                   rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the 
                   man's hand.

 WORF                              It's all right... do not struggle.

                   Worf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final 
                   console. We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran, 
                   one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen 
                   in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged 
                   at all over the years but he does have a permanent 
                   scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a 
                   few times, seems a little dazed.
 RIKER                              I'm Commander William Riker of the
                             Starship Enterprise.

 SORAN                              Soran... Doctor Tolian Soran...

                   Soran puts a hand to his head, still trying to get his 
                   bearings.

 RIKER                              Who attacked you, Doctor?

 SORAN                              I'm not sure... it happened so 
                             fast...

 SECURITY OFFICER                                      (calls out)
                             Commander -- you'd better take a 
                             look at this.

                   Riker and Worf move to the ladder as Beverly begins to 
                   scan Soran...

 53 NEW ANGLE - UPPER DECK 53 
                   Riker and Worf move over to the two Security Guards who 
                   are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from 
                   view. One guard turns over the body, revealing a 
                   ROMULAN SOLDIER. Worf looks at him in disgust.

 WORF                              Romulan.

                   Riker and Worf exchange a look. OFF their reactions...

 54 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS 54 
                   Data is sitting in a chair, petting SPOT THE CAT. 
                   Geordi is standing next to him.

 DATA                             Is she still angry?

 GEORDI                             No... but I'd stay out of Sickbay 
                            for a while if I were you. I 
                            still don't know why you dropped 
                            her in the water.

 DATA                             I was attempting to... get in the 
                            spirit of things. I thought it 
                            would be humorous.

                   Data frowns. troubled by this recent experience. He 
                   puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead. He activates 
                   a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN,
                   revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP  which is suspended in 
                   a glass and metal framework. Data looks at the chip 
                   for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern.

 GEORDI                             Data... you're not thinking about 
                            using that thing are you?

 DATA                             It has occurred to me on several 
                            occasions. But I believe this may 
                            be the appropriate time.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute. I thought you've 
                            always been afraid it would 
                            overload your neural net.

 DATA                             That is true. However, I believe 
                            my growth as an artificial 
                            life form has reached an impasse. 
                            For thirty-four years I have 
                            endeavored to become more "human" -
                            to grow beyond my original 
                            programming. And yet I am still 
                            unable to grasp such a simple 
                            concept as humor.

                            This emotion chip is the only 
                            answer.

                   Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip...
                   and reluctantly has to agree.

 GEORDI                             All right...

                   Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.

 GEORDI                             But at the first sign of trouble, 
                            I'm going to deactivate it. 
                            agreed?

 DATA                             Agreed.

                   Geordi works on Data's head for a moment, and then
                   OPENS a panel on Data's head, revealing the blinking 
                   circuitry within.

 55 INT. READY ROOM 55 
                   Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned 
                   and is staring out the window. Picard seems distracted 
                   during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker 
                   finishes his report.

 RIKER                             We found two dead Romulans aboard 
                            the station. We're analyzing 
                            their equipment to see if we can 
                            determine what ship they came 
                            from.

                   Picard nods absently.

 PICARD                             There's still no indication of why 
                            they attacked the station?

 RIKER                             We think they were looking for 
                            something -- they practically tore 
                            the place apart.

 PICARD                             Hmm... 
                                     (beat) 
                            Inform Starfleet Command. This 
                            could indicate a new Romulan 
                            threat in this sector.

 RIKER                             You want me to contact Starfleet?

 PICARD                             Is there a problem?

 RIKER                             No, sir.

 PICARD                             Thank you, Number One.

                   Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window. 
                   Riker hesitates, awkward.

 RIKER                             There is something else, Captain. 
                            One of the scientists. a Doctor
                            Soran... has insisted on speaking 
                            with you. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I told him you were busy, sir, but 
                            he said it was absolutely 
                            imperative that he speak with you 
                            right away.

 PICARD                             Understood. That will be all.

 RIKER                             Sir... is there anything wrong?

 PICARD                             No. Thank you.

                   A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS. Off Picard's 
                   unreadable face...

 CUT TO: 56 INT. TEN FORWARD 56 
                   The room is bustling with patrons and activity. Data 
                   ENTERS with an odd look on his face...his body 
                   language subtly altered. He is looking at the world 
                   through new eyes. Geordi is following him closely, 
                   watching his every move. They move to the bar. Guinan 
                   comes over -- she has not aged at all since the 
                   Enterprise-B. She sets down an exotic-looking container 
                   full of dark liquid.

 GUINAN                             You two just volunteered to be my 
                            first victims. 
                                     (re: liquid)
                            This is a new concoction I 
                            picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me, 
                            you're going to love it.

                   She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one 
                   and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him 
                   closely. Data frowns.

 GEORDI                             Well...?

 DATA                             I believe the beverage has 
                            provoked an emotional response.

 GEORDI                             Really? What do you feel?

 DATA                             I am uncertain. I have had little 
                            experience with emotions... I am 
                            unable to articulate the 
                            sensation.

 GUINAN                             Emotions?

 GEORDI                             I'll explain later...

                   Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make 
                   sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one 
                   of disgust.

 GUINAN                                       (to Geordi)
                            I don't think he likes it.

 DATA                                      (excited)
                            Yes. That is it. I hate it.

 GEORDI                             Data, I think the chip is 
                            working...

                   Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face.

 DATA                             Yes. I hate this! It is 
                            revolting!

                   Beat.

 GUINAN                             Another round?

 DATA                             Please.

                   In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward.

 57 FOLLOW PICARD 57 
                   as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a 
                   table by the windows. Soran is sitting at the table, 
                   staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His 
                   observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart 
                   from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the 
                   table.

 PICARD                             Doctor Soran...?

 SORAN                             Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for 
                            coming.

                   The men shake hands and Picard sits down. Soran is an 
                   imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems 
                   very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his 
                   work. Picard waves away a waiter.

 PICARD                             Nothing for me. 
                                     (brusque, to Soran) 
                            I understand there's something 
                            urgent you need to discuss with 
                            me.

 SORAN                             Yes. I need to return to the 
                            observatory immediately. I must 
                            continue a critical experiment I 
                            was running on the Amargosa star.
                    Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't 
                   sound that imperative to him.

 PICARD                             Doctor... we're still conducting 
                            an investigation into the attack. 
                            Once we've completed our work, 
                            we'll be happy to allow you and 
                            your fellow scientists back aboard 
                            the observatory. Until then --

 SORAN                             The timing is very important on my 
                            experiment -- if it is not
                            completed within the next twelve 
                            hours, years of research will be 
                            lost.

 PICARD                             We're doing the best we can. Now 
                            if you'll excuse me...

                   Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently 
                   but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected 
                   physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's 
                   face stops Picard in his tracks.

 SORAN                                      (cryptically)
                            They say time is the fire in 
                            which we burn... and right now, 
                            Captain, my time is running out. 
                                     (beat) 
                            We leave so many things unfinished 
                            in our lives -- I'm sure you can 
                            understand.

                   For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord 
                   within Picard.

                   He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks 
                   for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice 
                   is barely above a whisper.
 PICARD                             I'll see what I can do...

                   Picard walks away without a word before Soran can 
                   thank him. Soran looks after him with relief, then 
                   pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it. He 
                   looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it 
                   closed and head for the opposite exit from the one 
                   Picard took. FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until 
                   he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...

 58 SORAN'S POV 58 
                   of Guinan, who is now back at the bar.

 59 RESUME SORAN 59 
                   A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the 
                   sight of Guinan. He quickly turns and EXITS.

 60 ON GUINAN 60 
                   she begins to sense something, as though someone is 
                   watching her. She turns, looks in the direction where 
                   Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now. 
                   She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.

                   A short time later. A Romulan tricorder is connected 
                   to some diagnostic equipment near a console. Worf is 
                   talking to Riker.

                   Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram 
                   of sensor information.

 WORF                             One of the dead Romulans had a 
                            tricorder. We analyzed its sensor 
                            logs and found they were scanning 
                            for signature particles of a 
                            compound called trilithium.

 RIKER                             Trilithium?

 WORF                             An experimental compound the 
                            Romulans have been working on. In 
                            theory, a trilithium-based 
                            explosive would be thousands of 
                            times more powerful than an 
                            anti-matter weapon. But they never 
                            found a way to stabilize it.
 RIKER                             Why were they looking for it on a 
                            Federation observatory? It doesn't
                            make any sense.

                   Riker considers.

 RIKER                                      (cont'd)
                            Have Geordi and Data go over with 
                            the next Away Team...  tell them to 
                            scan the observatory for 
                            trilithium.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 CUT TO: 
 62 INT. OBSERVATORY OPS 62 
                   The station is still a wreck. Geordi and Data are 
                   scanning the room with tricorders.

 GEORDI                                      (off tricorder)
                            There's no sign of any trilithium 
                            in here.

                   Geordi continues to scan... then suddenly Data lets out 
                   a quiet GIGGLE. Geordi stops and turns to look at him.
                   Data giggles louder.

 DATA                                      (laughing, to himself)
                            I get it. I get it.

 GEORDI                             You get what?

                   Data laughs again.

 DATA                             When you said to Commander 
                            Riker...
                                     (imitating Geordi's voice) 
                            "The clown can stay, but the 
                            Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to 
                            go."

                   Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment.

 GEORDI                             What?

 DATA                             During the Farpoint mission. We 
                            were on the Bridge and you told a 
                            joke. That was the punch line.

 GEORDI                             The Farpoint mission? Data, that 
                            was seven years ago.

 DATA                             I know. I just got it. 
                                     (laughs) 
                            It was very funny.

 GEORDI                             Thanks.

                   Geordi indicates a corridor. They EXIT in that 
                   direction...

 63 INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 63 
                   A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other 
                   compartments. Geordi suddenly stops in front of what 
                   appears to be a standard bulkhead.

 GEORDI                             Wait a minute... there's a hidden 
                            doorway here. I can see the 
                            joint of the metal with my VISOR.

                   Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what 
                   appears to be a smooth bulkhead.

 DATA                                     (off tricorder)
                            There appears to be a dampening 
                            field in operation. I cannot scan 
                            beyond the bulkhead.

                   Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for 
                   a way to open the door.

 GEORDI                             I don't see a control panel...or 
                            an access port.

 DATA                                      (off tricorder)
                            It appears to be a magnetically 
                            sealed.

                   Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist 
                   and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within.

 DATA                             I believe I can reverse the 
                            polarity by attenuating my axial 
                            servo.

                   Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist 
                   over the door panel.

 DATA                                      (joking)
                            "Open sesame."

                   There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK. The 
                   door slides open.

 DATA                                      (smiles)
                            You could say I have a... magnetic 
                            personality.

                   Geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace. They EXIT 
                   to.

 64 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 64 
                   A small room with several probes stacked in holding 
                   racks. Geordi and Data scan.

 GEORDI                             I'm still not picking up anything. 
                            Someone went to a lot of trouble 
                            to shield this room.

                   They put their tricorders away and begin looking around 
                   the room. Data continues to snicker and giggle as he 
                   tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up. 
                   Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops
                   at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to 
                   the side.

 GEORDI                             Data, take a look at this. 
                                     (Data comes over) 
                            You ever seen a solar probe with 
                            this kind of configuration?

                   Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he 
                   opens and closes it like a mouth.

 DATA                                      (making tricorder "talk")
                            No, Geordi. I have not. It is 
                            most unusual.
                    Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of 
                   someone listening to a very bad comedian.
 GEORDI                             Just help me get this panel open.

                   Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the 
                   casing of the probe. They open the panel and Geordi
                   looks inside.he reacts to something.

 GEORDI                             Whoa. my VISOR'S picking up 
                            something in the theta band...it 
                            could be a trilithium signature.

                   Data suddenly start LAUGHING. Geordi turns in 
                   irritation.

 GEORDI                             Data, this isn't the time...

 DATA                                      (laughing)
                            I am sorry... but I cannot stop 
                            myself... I think something is 
                            wrong...

 64A ANGLE (VFX-P) 64A 
                   Data's laughter escalates into hysteria... then Data 
                   begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre 
                   "emotional seizure." A rush of EMOTIONS race across 
                   his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic 
                   blur of reactions contort his features. Then it stops 
                   and he FALLS to the ground.

 GEORDI                             Data!

                   Geordi rushes to him. Data has a look of surprise on 
                   his face as he blinks a few times. He sits up.

 GEORDI                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             I believe the emotional chip has 
                            overloaded my positronic relays.

 GEORDI                             We better get you back to the 
                            Ship. 
                                     (hits combadge) 
                            La Forge to Enterprise.

                   There's no response. Geordi frowns for a beat, then we 
                   hear Soran's voice.

 SORAN                             Is there a problem, gentlemen?

 65 INCLUDE SORAN 65 
                   standing in the room. Geordi didn't hear him come in.

 GEORDI                             Oh... Doctor... yeah, as a matter 
                            of fact, there is. There's a 
                            damping field in here blocking 
                            our com signal. 
                                     (re: Data) 
                            Will you give me a hand?

                   Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the 
                   solar probe Geordi was inspecting. He notes the opened 
                   panel and a disturbed look crosses his face. 

                   Soran looks back at Geordi.

 SORAN                             I'd be happy to.

                   Soran moves toward them. and then without warning, he 
                   punches Geordi in the face, KNOCKING the VISOR across 
                   the room. He whirls around and points a phaser at 
                   Data, who suddenly looks fearful.

 DATA                             Please don't hurt me.

 66 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS 66 
                   Picard is standing at the replicator.

 PICARD                             Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.

                   The cup of tea APPEARS in the replicator and at the 
                   same moment, the door CHIMES.

 PICARD                             Come.

                   Troi ENTERS. Picard would rather not be bothered right 
                   now, but he is polite as always.

 PICARD                             Counselor. What can I do for you?

 TROI                             Actually... I'm here to see if 
                            there's anything I can do for you.

 PICARD                             Well... I appreciate your concern, 
                            but I'd rather not discuss it 
                            right now, thank you.
                    But Troi won't be brushed away so easily.

 TROI                             I'm afraid I can't just leave it 
                            at that. The commanding officer 
                            of this ship is clearly distraught 
                            about something. As ship's 
                            Counselor, it's my duty to --

 PICARD                             As ship's counselor, it's your 
                            duty to know not only when you're 
                            needed... but also when you're 
                            not.

 TROI                             You can't fool an empath, Captain. 
                            I know exactly when I'm needed.

                   Picard is really not in the mood for this. His tone 
                   hardens.

 PICARD                             Well, with all due respect to your 
                            Betazoid senses, I prefer to be 
                            alone right now.

 TROI                             Very well. I suppose I could make 
                            out my weekly report to Starfleet
                            Command without your input. 
                                     (beat) 
                            "Admiral Lusby... regarding the 
                            unusual behavior of Jean-Luc

                            Irritable... remote... and 
                            uncooperative. I recommend forced 
                            shore leave at a Starbase facility

 PICARD                             All right, all right. You've made 
                            your point.

                   Troi takes a seat and patiently waits. Picard gets 
                   up.moves around the room for a moment...and stops. 
                   He speaks in a flat, unemotional tone of voice.

 PICARD                             The message I received...
                                     (beat) 
                            My brother... and his son -- my 
                            nephew -- burned to death in a 
                            fire.

                   Troi reacts, genuinely surprised.
 TROI                             Captain, I'm sorry. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I know there were a lot of 
                            unresolved conflicts between you 
                            and your brother.

 PICARD                             What I can't get out of my mind is 
                            the image of Rene -- my nephew. 
                            I just can't believe he's gone...

                   He trails off.

 TROI                             It's only natural to feel a 
                            heightened sense of tragedy when 
                            a child dies...
                                     (sensing more) 
                            But it goes deeper than that, 
                            doesn't it? I can sense that Rene 
                            meant a great deal to you.

 PICARD                             In a way, he was as close as I 
                            ever came to having a child of my 
                            own.

                   Troi eyes an open photo album on the table. She reaches 
                   over and flips through the pages for a moment. There 
                   are many photos inside... from many periods in time
                   including one of Picard's brother standing next to his 
                   young son. This is the Picard family album.

 TROI                             Your family history is very 
                            important to you, isn't it?

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            Ever since I was a little boy, I 
                            remember hearing about the family 
                            line. The Picards that fought at 
                            Trafalgar... the Picard's that 
                            settled the first Martian colony. 
                            When my brother married and had a 
                            son...

                   Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him.

 TROI                             ... You felt it was no longer your 
                            responsibility to carry on the 
                            family line.

 PICARD                                      (nods)
                            My brother had shouldered that 
                            burden... allowing me to pursue my 
                            own selfish needs...

 TROI                             There's nothing selfish about 
                            pursuing your own life... your own 
                            career.

                   Picard moves to the window, stares outside. A shadow 
                   crosses his face. He's getting to the heart of the 
                   matter.

 PICARD                             You know, Counselor... I'm not 
                            getting any younger. For some 
                            time now, I've been aware that 
                            there are fewer days ahead than 
                            there are behind...
                                     (beat) 
                            But I always took comfort in the 
                            fact that when I was gone, my
                            family would continue. But now...

                   Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the 
                   last page, an then flips through the remaining pages --
                   they are blank.

 PICARD                             I've had brushes with death...
                            more than I care to contemplate. 
                            I always accepted it as a 
                            calculated risk that goes along 
                            with wearing this uniform. 
                                     (beat) 
                            But now... the idea of death has 
                            a terrible sense of finality to 
                            it.

                   He looks at her.

 PICARD                             I'm the last Picard.

                   A quiet beat as Troi considers him.

 TROI                             Captain, perhaps we --

                   Suddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT  from outside the 
                   windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to 
                   the window and shield their eyes against the glare.

                   Picard and Troi ENTER from a turbolift. Riker and Worf 
                   at their stations. The star is on the Viewscreen, 
                   getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris 
                   is being ejected into space.

 PICARD                             Report.

 RIKER                             A quantum implosion has occurred 
                            within the Amargosa star. All
                            nuclear fusion is breaking down.

 PICARD                             How is that possible?

 WORF                             Sensor records show a solar probe 
                            was launched from the observatory 
                            a few moments ago.

 RIKER                             The star's going to collapse in a 
                            matter of minutes.

                   Something beeps on Worf's console.

 WORF                             Sir, the implosion has produced 
                            a level twelve shock wave.

 TROI                                      (shocked)
                            Level twelve? That'll destroy 
                            everything in this system.

 RIKER                                      (to Worf)
                            Did they return to the ship?

 WORF                                      (works)
                            No, sir. They are not aboard.

 PICARD                             How long until the shock wave hits 
                            the observatory?

 WORF                             Four minutes, forty seconds.

                   Picard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the 
                   turbolift.

 RIKER                             Mister Worf.

                   Riker and Worf EXIT.

 70 EXT. SPACE- THE STAR (VFX-I) 70 
                   The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the 
                   star is a huge shock wave- a rapidly growing sphere of 
                   energy.

 71 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P) 71 
                   Soran is standing at a console watching a graphic 
                   depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the 
                   door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his 
                   phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just 
                   outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined 
                   earlier is now gone.)

 RIKER                                      (to Worf)
                            What the hell's he doing?

                   Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying 
                   unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen.

 RIKER                                      (yells to Soran)
                            Soran, did you hear that? There's 
                            a level twelve shock wave coming.
                            We've got to get out of here!

                   Soran's only answer is another phaser blast.

 74 INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P) 74 
                   Soran is continuing to SHOOT at Riker and Worf. Riker 
                   suddenly notices something off-camera.

                   Data is huddled in a corner of the room, cowering in 
                   fear.

                            Geordi!

                   Data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face.

                            Am... afraid.

                   Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS. Soran reaches 
                   down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and 
                   the two of them DEMATERIALIZE. (Soran has the VISOR in

                   On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of 
                   the darkening star and shock wave. MOVE TO REVEAL

                   We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and 
                   patched in several places, obviously not a first-line 
                   model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR, 
                   two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters. 
                   aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D. 
                   male Klingons man the various stations.

                   The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in 
                   awe.

 B'ETOR                             Toh-pak-cha... 
                            (Glorious...)

 LURSA                             HoS qorDu... 
                            (A great power...)

                   Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark 
                   and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he 
                   strides up to the sisters.

 B'ETOR                                      (excited, to Soran)
                            You've done it, Soran.

                   But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the 
                   jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several 
                   Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons...
                   but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.

 B'ETOR                             Wait!

                   She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her 
                   mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.

 B'ETOR                             I hope for your sake that you are 
                            initiating a mating ritual.
 SORAN                             You got careless. The Romulans 
                            came looking for their missing 
                            trilithium.

 B'ETOR                             Impossible. We left no survivors 
                            on their outpost.

                   B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.

 SORAN                             They knew it was aboard the 
                            observatory. If the Enterprise 
                            hadn't intervened, they would have 
                            found it.

 LURSA                             But they didn't find it... and now 
                            we have a weapon of unlimited 
                            power.

 SORAN                             I have the weapon, Lursa. And if 
                            you ever want me to give it to 
                            you, I advise you to be a little 
                            more careful in the future.

                   B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to 
                   his throat.

 B'ETOR                             Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

                   Soran is unfazed by this threat.

 SORAN                             Without my research... the
                            trilithium is worthless... as are 
                            your plans to reconquer the 
                            Klingon Empire.

                   Lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife 
                   away.

 SORAN                             Set course for the Veridian

                   A KLINGON GUARD ENTERS dragging the unconscious Geordi.

 KLINGON GUARD                             What shall I do with this?

                   Soran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face.
 SORAN                             Bring him with me. I need some 
                            answers from Mr. La Forge.

                   Soran EXITS.

 80 INT. CORRIDOR 80 
                   Riker and Worf are on the move down the corridor.

 WORF                             I have spoken to the Klingon High 
                            Council, sir. They identified the 
                            Bird of Prey as belonging to the 
                            Duras sisters.

 RIKER                                     (surprised)
                            Lursa and B'Etor...? This doesn't 
                            make any sense. A renowned 
                            stellar physicist somehow uses a 
                            trilithium probe to destroy a 
                            star, kidnaps Geordi... and 
                            escapes with a pair of Klingon 
                            renegades... Why? What the hell's 
                            going on?

                   They EXIT to...

 81 INT. SICKBAY 81 
                   Worf and Riker ENTER. Beverly is closing a panel on 
                   the back of Data's head. He is sitting on a bio-bed, 
                   scanning himself with a tricorder.

 RIKER                             How is he?

 BEVERLY                             It looks like a power surge fused 
                            the emotional chip into his neural
                            net.

 WORF                             Will that be a danger to him?

 BEVERLY                             I don't think so. The chip still 
                            seems to be working. I'd feel 
                            better if I could take a closer
                            look, but I can't remove it 
                            without completely dismantling his 
                            cerebral conduit.

 RIKER                                      (to Data)
                            Looks like you're stuck with 
                            emotions for a while. How do you 
                            feel?

 DATA                             I am quite... preoccupied with 
                            concern about Geordi.

 RIKER                             We all are, Data. But we're going 
                            to get him back.

 DATA                             I hope so, sir.

                   Data's expression is still one of concern. Beverly 
                   pulls Riker aside.

 BEVERLY                             Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's 
                            background.

                   Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of 
                   Doctor Soran along with some biographical information 
                   appears.

 BEVERLY                             He's an El-Aurian... over three 
                            hundred years old. He lost his 
                            entire family when the Borg 
                            destroyed his world. Soran 
                            escaped with a handful of other 
                            refugees aboard a ship called the 
                            Lakul. The ship was destroyed by 
                            some kind of energy ribbon, but 
                            Soran and forty-six others were 
                            rescued by the Enterprise-B.

 RIKER                                      (reacts)
                            That was the mission where James 
                            Kirk was killed.

 BEVERLY                             I checked the passenger manifest 
                            of the Lakul... guess who else was 
                            on board?

                   She hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears 
                   on the screen. Riker reacts to the image...

 CUT TO: 
 82 INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS 82 
                   Close on Guinan as she looks up, surprised.

 GUINAN                             Soran? That's a name I haven't 
                            heard in a long time.

                   MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any
                   of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard 
                   furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The 
                   floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are 
                   draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and 
                   subdued.

                   Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross-
                   legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an 
                   easy familiarity... two old friends who know each 
                   other well.

 PICARD                             Do you remember him?

 GUINAN                             Oh yes. I remember everyone who 
                            was on the Lakul... every face.
                            even the ones who didn't make 
                            it...

                   Guinan stands and begins to move about the room...
                   she's clearly troubled by the memories. She hesitates, 
                   looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments. 
                   Picard moves to her.

 PICARD                             Guinan. It's important that you 
                            tell me what you know. We think 
                            Soran's developed a weapon... a 
                            terrible weapon. It might give 
                            him enough power to --

 GUINAN                             Soran doesn't care about power or 
                            weapons. All he cares about is 
                            getting back to the Nexus.

 PICARD                             What's the "Nexus"?

                   Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some 
                   exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting 
                   herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.

 GUINAN                             It's a place I've tried very hard 
                            to forget...

                   She makes the decision to plunge ahead.

 GUINAN                             That ribbon isn't just some random 
                            energy phenomenon traveling 
                            through space... it's a doorway. 
                            It leads to another place... the 
                            Nexus. It doesn't exist in our 
                            Universe... and it doesn't play by 
                            the same rules either.

 PICARD                             What happened to you?

 GUINAN                             I can't remember very much... what 
                            it looked like or how long I was
                            there... but I do remember how it 
                            felt...

                   She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind 
                   of awe at the memory.

 GUINAN                             It was like being inside... joy. 
                            As if joy was a real thing that I
                            could wrap around myself. I've 
                            never been so content...

                   A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.

 PICARD                             But then you were beamed away...

                   Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.

 GUINAN                             I was pulled away. I didn't want 
                            to leave; none of us did. I felt 
                            like I'd left a part of myself 
                            behind. All I could think about 
                            was getting back... I didn't care 
                            what I had to do.

                   Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.

 GUINAN                             It took a long time, but 
                            eventually I learned to live with 
                            it. And I began to realize that 
                            my experience in the Nexus had 
                            changed me...
                                     (beat)
                            I knew things about people...
                            about events...about time...

 PICARD                             Your "sixth sense"... I've always 
                            wondered where it came from...
                                     (beat) 
                            And what about Soran?

 GUINAN                             Soran may still be obsessed with 
                            getting back. And if he is, he'll 
                            do anything to find that doorway 
                            again.

 PICARD                             But why destroy a star...? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Thank you, Guinan.

                   He heads for the door.

 GUINAN                             Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.

                   Picard stops, looks at her.

 GUINAN                             Let them send another starship. 
                            Don't get near the ribbon. If you 
                            go into that Nexus, you're not 
                            going to care about Soran or the 
                            Enterprise or me. All you're 
                            going to care about is how it 
                            feels to be there.
                                    (beat) 
                            And you're never going to come 
                            back.

                   Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her 
                   eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.

 CUT TO: 
 83 INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS (VFX-P) 83 
                   A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon 
                   ship. Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the 
                   room looks well-worn and ill-maintained. Soran is 
                   seated behind a table, holding the VISOR. A PADD and 
                   Soran's pocket watch sit on the table. Geordi is 
                   sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has 
                   been removed. He looks very tense.
 SORAN                                      (re: VISOR)
                            A remarkable piece of equipment...
                            but a little inelegant, wouldn't 
                            you say? 
                                     (beat) 
                            Have you ever considered a 
                            prosthesis that would make you 
                            look a little more... normal?

 GEORDI                             What's normal?

 SORAN                             Normal is what everyone else is...
                            and what you are not.

 GEORDI                             What do you want?

                   Soran takes a moment.

 SORAN                             As you may or may not be aware, I 
                            am an El-Aurian. Some people call 
                            us a race of "listeners". We 
                            listen. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Right now, Mr. La Forge, you 
                            have my undivided attention. I 
                            want to listen to everything you 
                            know about trilithium. and me.

                   Geordi thinks.

 GEORDI                             Trilithium is an experimental 
                            compound developed by the 
                            Romulans. I think it's a 
                            derivative of --

                   Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it. 
                   Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be 
                   seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his 
                   chest. Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the 
                   protrusion is suddenly gone.

 SORAN                             I don't want a science lecture. 
                            You were on that observatory 
                            looking for trilithium... why?

 GEORDI                             I was ordered to by the Captain.

                   On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior 
                   graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair. The 
                   graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves. 
                   A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe 
                   inside his body. Right now, the dot is in the middle 
                   of his chest.

 SORAN                             Let's try to move beyond the usual 
                            prisoner-interrogator banter, 
                            shall we? You have information, 
                            and I need it. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Did the Captain explain his orders 
                            to you? Did he say why you were 
                            searching for trilithium?

 GEORDI                             No.

 SORAN                             What about... Guinan? What has 
                            she told you about me?

 GEORDI                             Guinan? I don't know what you're 
                            talking about...

                   On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position 
                   next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi.

 SORAN                             My instincts tell me you're lying. 
                            And I know that can't be easy for
                            you... 
                                     (off PADD) 
                            I can see you have a good heart.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi
                   grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a 
                   few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps 
                   and starts to breathe.

 SORAN                             Oh... I forgot to tell you. While 
                            you were unconscious, I injected 
                            a nano-probe into your 
                            bloodstream. It's been navigating 
                            your cardiovascular system... and 
                            right now I've attached it to your 
                            left ventricle. 
                                     (smiles) 
                            A little trick I picked up 
                            from the Borg.

 GEORDI                                      (gasping)
                            Yeah... they're full of great 
                            ideas.

 SORAN                             I just stopped your heart for five 
                            seconds. It felt like an 
                            eternity, didn't it? Did you know 
                            that you can stop the human heart 
                            for up to ten minutes before the 
                            onset of brain damage?

 GEORDI                             No... I didn't know that...

 SORAN                             We learn something new about 
                            ourselves every day. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Now. Maybe I didn't make myself 
                            clear. It is very important that 
                            you tell me exactly what Captain 
                            Picard knows.

 GEORDI                             I told you everything... you might 
                            as well just kill me right now...

                   Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a 
                   moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's 
                   a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.

 SORAN                             I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Let's try thirty seconds.

                   Soran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and 
                   strains against an unimaginable pain.

                   Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover...
                   sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick
                   away...

 CUT TO: 
 84 INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P) 84 
                   A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and 
                   computers which handle the enormous task of tracking 
                   the ship's position in space. 

                   The monitors around the room display various diagrams 
                   of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the 
                   film).

                   Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great 
                   deal of complex information on the screen. Picard is 
                   standing next to him. Throughout the following, Data 
                   seems distracted and preoccupied.
 DATA                             According to our information, the 
                            ribbon is a conflux of temporal 
                            energy which travels through our 
                            galaxy every thirty-nine point one 
                            years

 PICARD                             When is it expected back?

                   Data doesn't answer right away.

 PICARD                             Data?

 DATA                             Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has 
                            already entered the galaxy. It 
                            will pass through this sector in 
                            approximately thirty-one hours.

                   Picard moves about the room... he's frustrated... 
                   tired... but determined to find out what's going on.

 PICARD                             Guinan said Soran was trying to 
                            get back to the ribbon... if 
                            that's true, then there must be 
                            some connection with the Amargosa 
                            star.

 DATA                             The star's destruction has had 
                            numerous astro-physical effects 
                            within this sector. However, none 
                            of them appear to have a 
                            connection to the energy ribbon.

 PICARD                             Give me a list of those effects. 
                            I want to know every single thing 
                            which has been altered or 
                            changed... no matter how 
                            insignificant...

 DATA                             It will take a few moments for the 
                            computer to compile the 
                            information.

                   Data works the computer and then the computer begins to 
                   work. Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast 
                   and gloomy. He sits down and puts his head in his 
                   hands. Picard finally has to say something.

 PICARD                             Data, are you all right?

 DATA                             No, sir. I am finding it 
                            difficult to concentrate... I 
                            believe I am overwhelmed with 
                            feelings of... remorse and regret 
                            concerning my actions on the 
                            observatory.

 PICARD                             What do you mean?

 DATA                             I wanted to save Geordi... I 
                            tried. but I experienced 
                            something I did not expect. 
                                     (beat) 
                            I believe it was fear.

                   Picard regards him sympathetically.

 PICARD                             Fear is a very difficult emotion 
                            to overcome. It's something we 
                            all have to learn to deal with.

 DATA                             But I did not deal with it, sir. 
                            I let it prevent me from helping 
                            my friend. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Does that make me a coward?

 PICARD                             No. And what you must try to 
                            avoid is becoming consumed by 
                            another emotion which I believe 
                            you're beginning to experience...
                            guilt.

 DATA                                      (considers)
                            Guilt. It is a most unpleasant 
                            feeling.

 84A ANGLE (VFX-P) 84A 
                   The computer finishes its calculations and the console 
                   BEEPS. Data works the console. Information appears on 
                   screen.

 DATA                             According to our current 
                            information, the destruction of 
                            the Amargosa star has had the 
                            following effects in this sector: 
                            gamma emissions have increased by
                            five percent... the starship 
                            Bozeman was forced to make a
                            course correction... a research
                            project on Gorik Four was 
                            halted due to increased neutrino 
                            particles... ambient magnetic 
                            fields have decreased by --

 PICARD                             Wait. The Bozeman... why did it 
                            change course?

 DATA                                      (matter of fact)
                            The destruction of the Amargosa 
                            star has altered the gravitational
                            forces throughout the sector. Any 
                            ship passing through this region 
                            will have to make a minor course 
                            correction.

                   Picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto 
                   something here. He moves to a large table in the 
                   center of the room.

 PICARD                                      (musing)
                            A minor course correction...

                            Where is the ribbon now?

 84B ANGLE (VFX-P) 84B 
                   Data moves to the table to work. after a few beats, 
                   an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the 
                   ceiling of the room. A BLINKING DOT shows the position 
                   of the ribbon.

 DATA                             This is its current position.

 PICARD                             Can you project its course?

                   Data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional 
                   turmoil. Picard finally has to lay down the law.

 PICARD                                      (firm)
                            Data. I have nothing but sympathy 
                            for what you're going through. 
                            But right now, I need your full 
                            attention on the task at hand.  
                            If you can't provide it... then I'll 
                            have to relieve you of duty until 
                            Doctor Crusher can remove this.
                            emotion chip of yours. I'm sorry, 
                            but you leave me no other choice.

                   This snaps Data back... he considers this for a long 
                   moment, then looks  determined.

 DATA                             I do not wish to remove the chip, 
                            sir. Although these emotions are
                            proving difficult to deal with...
                            I cannot imagine going back to a 
                            life without them. I have taken 
                            an important step toward becoming 
                            truly human. If I were to turn 
                            back now...
                                     (beat) 
                            I would like to continue in my 
                            duties, sir.

                   Picard smiles at him.

 PICARD                             Courage is an emotion too, Data.

                            Now... can you project the course
                            of the ribbon?

 DATA                             I believe so.

                   Data works the console. A RED LINE moves to form an 
                   arc through the star field. Picard examines the display 
                   for a moment and nods... he's excited, on to

 PICARD                             Where was the Amargosa star?

                   Data works. A STAR is highlighted near the red line.

 PICARD                             Now... you said the gravitational
                            forces in this sector have been 
                            altered... could that also affect 
                            the course of the ribbon?

 PICARD                             That's what Soran's doing... he's

                            path... why not simply fly into it 
                            with a ship?

                   Data thinks for a moment.

 DATA                             Our records show that every ship 
                            which has approached the ribbon 
                            has either been destroyed or 
                            severely damaged.

                   Picard thinks about this... then has a flash of 
                   insight.

 PICARD                             He can't go to the ribbon... so 
                            he's trying to make the ribbon 
                            come to him.
                                     (beat) 
                            Data, is it going to pass near any 
                            M-Class planets?

 DATA                                      (works)
                            Yes, sir. There are two in the 
                            Veridian system.

 84E ANGLE (VFX-P) 84E 
                   The display ZOOMS IN on a star very close to the 
                   ribbon's path. We now see a SOLAR SYSTEM with a single 
                   star and FOUR PLANETS. The RED LINE moves directly 
                   through the system -- it passes very close to the third
                   planet. Picard eyes that planet and points to it.

 PICARD                             It's very close to Veridian 
                            Three... but not close enough...

                   Picard's mind is going a mile a minute. He suddenly 
                   has a horrible realization.

 PICARD                             Data, what would happen to the 
                            ribbon's path if he destroyed the
                            Veridian star itself?

 84F ANGLE (VFX-P) 84F 
                   Data works. On the display, the Veridian star suddenly 
                   DARKENS and GOES OUT. The RED LINE shifts slightly 
                   until it makes an exact INTERSECTION WITH THE THIRD 
                   PLANET. They both react to this sight. they're both 
                   aware of just how serious this is.

 PICARD                             That's where he's going.

 DATA                             It should be noted, sir, that the 
                            collapse of the Veridian star 
                            would produce a shock wave similar 
                            to the one we observed at 
                            Amargosa.

 PICARD                                      (grim)
                            And destroy every planet in the 
                            system.

                   Picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.

 PICARD                             Are any of them inhabited?

 DATA                             Veridian Three is uninhabited.
                            but Veridian Four supports a pre-
                            industrial humanoid society.

 PICARD                             Population?

 DATA                             Approximately two hundred thirty 
                            million.

                   A grim beat.

 WORF'S COM VOICE                             Worf here, sir.

                   Picard heads for the exit, a sense of urgency and 
                   determination in his every move.

 PICARD                             Red Alert, Mister Worf. Set a

 LURSA                             Did you get anything from the 
                            human?

 SORAN                             No. His heart just isn't in it.

 KLINGON HELM                                      (off console)
                            We have entered orbit of Veridian

 SORAN                             Prepare to transport me to the 
                            surface.

 B'ETOR                             Wait. When do we get our payment?

                   Soran hands B'Etor a small computer CHIP.

 SORAN                             This contains all the information 
                            you'll need to build a trilithium

 KLINGON HELM                             They are hailing us.

 B'ETOR                             Du'cha (On speakers.)

                   The Helm works. We hear PICARD'S COM VOICE.

 PICARD'S COM VOICE                             Klingon vessel. We know what 
                            you're doing, and we will destroy 
                            any probe launched toward the 
                            Veridian star.

                   Soran's expression darkens.

 B'ETOR                             What do we do?

                   Soran checks his watch.

 SORAN                             There's no time for this. 
                            Eliminate them.

 B'ETOR                                      (reacts)
                            That is a Galaxy class Starship. 
                            We are no match for them.

                   Soran thinks for a moment... then  he gets an idea. He 
                   pulls Geordi's VISOR out of a pocket. He eyes it with 
                   intent.

 SORAN                             I think it's time we gave Mister 
                            La Forge his sight back.

                   Off Lursa and B'Etor's curiosity...

 CUT TO: 
 87 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (VFX-I) 87 
                   nearing Veridian Three. The planet's STAR is visible.
 88 INT. BRIDGE 88 
                   Picard is pacing. Riker, Data, Worf, Troi, N.D.s at 
                   their stations. The ship is at Red Alert. Data's mood 
                   has improved. He's making an effort to keep a positive 
                   outlook... to stay upbeat.

 RIKER                             Maybe they're not out there.

 PICARD                             They're just trying to decide 
                            whether a twenty year-old Klingon 
                            Bird of Prey is any match for the 
                            Federation flagship.

 TROI                             Or perhaps they're on the 
                            surface...

 PICARD                             Mister Data, scan the planet for 
                            life forms.

                   Data smiles, delighted at the request.

 DATA                             I was hoping you would ask me to 
                            do that, Captain. I just love to 
                            scan for life forms.

                   As Data works, he breaks into a merry little song.

 DATA                                      (sings)
                            "Life forms... tiny little

                            life forms --"

 PICARD                             Commander.

 DATA                             Sorry, sir. 
                                     (works) 
                            There is too much interference in 
                            the planet's ionosphere for an 
                            accurate reading.

                   Worf turns to Picard.

 WORF                             Sir, according to my calculations, 
                            a solar probe launched from either
                            the Klingon ship or the planet's 
                            surface will take eleven seconds 
                            to reach the star. 
                                     (beat) 
                            However, since we do not know the 
                            exact point of origin, it will 
                            take us between eight and fifteen 
                            seconds to lock our weapons onto 
                            it.

                   They exchange a grim look.

 RIKER                                      (quiet, to Picard)
                            That's a pretty big margin of 
                            error.

 PICARD                             Too big. How long until the 
                            ribbon arrives?

                            sir.

 PICARD                                      (disturbed)
                            I have to find a way to get to 
                            Soran...

                   An alarm goes off on Worf's console.

 PICARD                             On screen.

 88B ANGLE (VFX-P) 88B 
                   On the view screen, Lursa and B'Etor APPEAR.

 LURSA                             Captain. What an unexpected 
                            pleasure.

 PICARD                             Lursa, I want to talk to Soran.

 LURSA                             I'm afraid the Doctor is no longer 
                            aboard our ship.

 PICARD                             Then I'll beam down to his 
                            location. Just give us his 
                            coordinates.

 B'ETOR                             The Doctor values his privacy. He 
                            would be quite... upset if an 
                            Away Team interrupted him.

 PICARD                             Very well... I'll beam to your 
                            ship and you can transport me to 
                            Soran...

                            They'll kill you just like they 
                            Killed Geordi.

                   Lursa and B'Etor exchange a glance.

 LURSA                                      (innocent)
                            We did not kill your Engineer. 
                            He's been... our guest.

 RIKER                             Then return him.

 B'ETOR                             In exchange for what?

 PICARD                             Me... If you let me speak to 
                            Soran.

                   The two sisters appear to consider this for a moment.

 B'ETOR                                      (to Lursa)
                            The Captain would make a much more 
                            valuable hostage.

 LURSA                                      (to Picard)
                            We'll consider it a prisoner 
                            exchange.

 PICARD                             Agreed.

                   The transmission ENDS. Picard heads for the Turbolift.

                   aide, pull out their tricorders and scan him. Geordi

                   looks around. strange animals and birds can be heard. 

                   He turns and sees Soran standing nearby, calmly looking 
                   at his pocket watch. Soran puts the watch away.

 SORAN                             You must think I'm quite the 
                            madman.

 PICARD                             The thought had crossed my mind...

 SORAN                             The only possible reason you're 
                            here is because you're not 
                            entirely confident you can shoot 
                            down my probe after all. So 
                            you've come to dissuade me from 
                            my horrific plan. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Good luck.

                   Soran turns his back on Picard and walks away.

                   Picard takes a step to follow him and then is JOLTED
                   backward by a large FORCEFIELD which briefly flashes 
                   into view. The field completely surrounds the plateau, 
                   enclosing Soran and the scaffolding, with Picard on the 
                   outside. OFF Picard's surprise...

                   if she's leaning over Geordi. She smiles and starts 
                   talking. We can see her lips move, but we can't hear 
                   what she's saying.

                   Picard is walking the perimeter of the invisible

                   concentrating on his PADD as Picard tries to engage him 
                   on some level.

 PICARD                             You don't need to do this, 
                            Soran... I'm sure we could find 
                            another way to get you into this 
                            Nexus.

 93A ANGLE (VFX-P) 93A 
                   Soran gets up and works his control PADD. Suddenly a 
                   probe LAUNCHER DECLOAKS  in the middle of the plateau. 
                   The launcher is a cylindrical apparatus the size of a 
                   small car. 

                   Soran goes to the launcher, steps onto it and begins 
                   working the control panel.

 SORAN                                      (calm, distracted)
                            I've spent eighty years looking 
                            for another way, Captain. This is 
                            the only one. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Of course, you could always come 
                            with me. You fancy yourself an 
                            explorer. Here's a chance to 
                            explore something no human has 
                            ever experienced.

 PICARD                             Not if it means killing over two 
                            hundred million people. 
                                     (beat, then with 
                                      meaning) 
                            I wonder... did your wife Leandra 
                            know that she married a man who 
                            was capable of mass murder?

                   This has touched a nerve in Soran... something dark 
                   and ugly flickers across his face.

 PICARD                                      (continuing; pressing on)
                            When you tucked your children into 
                            bed... do you suppose they ever
                            suspected that their father would 
                            one day kill millions as casually 
                            as he kissed them goodnight?

                   Soran looks up at Picard... and for a moment we can see 
                   that Picard has really gotten to him here... then he 
                   finally smiles a smile that doesn't quite reach his 
                   eyes.

 SORAN                             Nice try.

                   Forcefield. he's also still trying to engage Soran, 
                   find some way to get to him.
 PICARD                             What you're about to do is no 
                            different from when the Borg 
                            destroyed your world.

                   Soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and 
                   conversational.

 SORAN                             You're right. And there was a 
                            time when I wouldn't have hurt 
                            anyone. Then the Borg came... and 
                            they showed me that if there is 
                            one constant in this universe, 
                            it's death.

                            Afterwards, I began to realize 
                            that none of it mattered. We're 
                            all going to die anyway. It's 
                            only a question of how and when. 
                            You will too, Captain. You might 
                            contract a fatal disease... you 
                            might die in battle...

                   Soran now turns and fixes Picard with a penetrating 
                   look.

 SORAN                             ... or burn to death in a fire.

                   Picard freezes at this. Soran steps off the launcher 
                   with a confident look... he moves closer to where 
                   Picard is standing.

 SORAN                             You looked surprised. But you 
                            shouldn't be. I've been to the 
                            Nexus, Captain. I know things 
                            about people. 
                                     (beat) 
                            Aren't you beginning to feel time 
                            gaining on you? It's like a 
                            predator. It's stalking you. You 
                            can try to outrun it with 
                            doctors... medicines.new 
                            technologies... but in the end, 
                            time is going to hunt you down...
                            and make the kill.

                   This strikes home with Picard's own recent concerns...
                   he struggles for a moment.

 PICARD                             We're all. mortal, Soran. It's 
                            one of the truths of our 
                            existence.

 SORAN                             What if I told you I found a new 
                            truth...

 SORAN                             Time has no meaning there. The 
                            predator has no teeth.

                   Soran glances up at the sky expectantly, then turns 
                   away from Picard and goes back to work on the Launcher.

                   GNARLED ROOT from a large nearby tree. The root is 
                   poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through 
                   which daylight can be seen. Picard's mind begins

                   pebble and, while keeping his eye on the root, he tosses 
                   the pebble into the air, where it HITS the forcefield.

                      that the bottom border of the field follows the contour 
                      of the root. But it does not extend underneath the arch. 

                   -- Soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.

 SORAN                             Careful, Captain. That's a fifty

                            What do we know about it? Are

                            we can use that to our advantage?

 WORF                             I do not see how. The plasma coil 
                            is part of their cloaking

 RIKER                                      (to Data)
                            Could we access the defective coil 
                            and trigger their cloak?

                            Perhaps. 
                                     (suddenly enthusiastic) 
                            Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic
                            pulse, it might reset the coil and 
                            engage the cloaking systems.

 WORF                                      (onto the idea)
                            As their cloak begins to engage, 
                            their shields will drop.

 RIKER                             Right. And they'll be vulnerable 
                            for at least two seconds.

                            No problem.

                   Data goes to work.

 RIKER                             Worf, prepare a spread of photon 
                            torpedoes. We'll have to hit them 
                            the instant they begin to cloak.

 WORF                             Aye, sir.

 RIKER                             We're only going to get one shot

                   Picard has made his way back to the gnarled root. He 
                   stands a few feet away... a couple of pebbles in his 
                   hand. 

                   He glances at Soran, who's absorbed with his work on 
                   the launcher. 

                   Picard then surreptitiously TOSSES a pebble toward the 
                   root. It misses and BOUNCES off the FORCEFIELD. Soran 
                   looks over his shoulder at Picard, who sits down on a 
                   rock. Soran returns to his work. 

                   Picard tosses a second pebble -- this one also hits the

                   Picard doesn't respond. Soran goes back to work.

                   Picard waits a moment, then takes aim and TOSSES
                   another pebble toward the root. This time, the pebble 
                   bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau -

                   Picard has dropped to the ground and is on his back -
                   he's trying to wriggle underneath the root. It's not 
                   easy. he knows there's not much room between the 
                   ground and the invisible field. he just gets his head
                   and shoulders underneath when he accidentally TOUCHES the 
                   field and it CRACKLES violently around him --Picard is 
                   jolted by the shock.

 132A SORAN (VFX-P) 132A 
                   turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then 
                   draws his weapon. Soran quickly fires at Picard.

 132B THE GROUND (VFX-P) 132B 
                   is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and smoke, 
                   obscuring Picard  and the whole area momentarily.

                   -- Soran jumps down one level on the scaffolding, his 
                      disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard 
                      somehow survived. Soran peers through the cloud of 
                      dust and debris.

                   -- The dust from the explosion finally CLEARS... but 
                      Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground 
                      where he was crawling.

                   glances up at the sky and sees the distant ENERGY
                   RIBBON just coming into view. There's no time to look 
                   for Picard. 

                   -- Soran begins to climb the scaffolding.

                   Soran is climbing up the scaffolding. He gets a couple 
                   of levels up, and then suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the 
                   face. Picard has made it inside the field.

                   A quick fight ensues, during which Picard is knocked a 
                   few levels down on the scaffolding. He LANDS hard --
                   happens to look up into the sky. He sees something.--

 144 PICARD'S POV - THE SKY (VFX-I) 144 
                   The ENERGY RIBBON can be seen in the distant sky 

                   -- a bizarre snake of color streaking across the deep blue 
                      sky. Time is almost up.

 145 RESUME ACTION (VFX-I) 145 
                   -- Picard avoids a vicious kick from Soran, glances 
                      down at the probe launcher, and realizes he's got one 
                      chance. He rolls to his feet, runs toward the probe 
                      launcher.

                   -- There is a THUNDEROUS ROAR as the launcher FIRES THE
                      PROBE into the sky.

                   -- The plateau is suddenly quiet as the probe streaks
                      toward the distant sun and disappears from view. 
                      Picard gets to his knees, stares after the probe, 
                      shocked. He's failed. 

                   -- They watch the sun for a silent moment, waiting...

                    Soran, a look of profound elation on his face, makes 
                   his way to the top of the scaffolding and looks into 
                   the sky.

 148 PICARD (VFX-I) 148 
                   gets to his feet and stares at the onrushing Ribbon,
                   the wind whipping up on the plateau. He backs away at 
                   the sight, coming to a stop with his back against the
                   scaffolding. There's no where to run...

                   Soran. The plateau is strangely and utterly SILENT
                   after the passage of the Ribbon... even the birds have

                   being led through a darkened HALLWAY. He is wearing a 
                   blindfold. Off screen hands tug and pull at him, 
                   leading him forward down the hall. 

                   He's lost and confused, unsure where he is or what's 
                   going on. He tries to resist, but can't... the hands 
                   keep pulling at him...

                   He is finally brought out into a larger room, dark. 
                   The hands release him and he stands alone. He takes a 
                   beat and tries to take control of the situation.

 PICARD                              What's going on? Where am I?

                   Two hands reach into frame from off screen and remove 
                   the blindfold...

 154 PICARD'S POV 154 
                   As the room comes into focus. The first thing we see 
                   is an enormous, gaily decorated CHRISTMAS TREE
                   sparkling with hundreds of lights.

 155 REVEAL THE ROOM 155 
                   A 24th-century FRENCH LIVING ROOM. It is beautifully
                   decorated with lights, ornaments, holly. brightly 
                   wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas 
                   tree. There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in 
                   the room, all looking at Picard with bright, smiling 
                   faces, waiting for him to say something.

                   Picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to 
                   react. Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we 
                   move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties 
                   standing next to Picard.

 WOMAN                              Go on... say something. They're 
                             waiting.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              I... don't know what to say...

                   One of the children, a young GIRL, speaks up.

 GIRL                              Say Merry Christmas, Papa!

 PICARD                                      (in a daze)
                             Merry... Christmas...

                   The children break out into applause. The woman kisses 
                   him on the cheek, then steers him to a large, 
                   overstuffed chair. Picard sits down and the 
                   children starts handing out presents with much laughter 
                   and chatting.

 CHILDREN                              This one's for you... where's 
                             mine?... I hope this is the book 
                             I asked for... take this one to 
                             Papa...

                   As the activity swirls around him, Picard begins to 
                   feel an immense  sense of satisfaction and happiness. 
                   It's like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and 
                   contentment fills Picard. It's a wondrous experience. 
                   He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across 
                   his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even 
                   want to understand at the moment, he is very, very 
                   happy.
 GIRL                                      (to Picard)
                             Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?

                   Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in 
                   the world.

 PICARD                              Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly 
                             beautiful. All of it.

                   All of the children now crowd around the chair with a 
                   single large gift and hand it to Picard. One of the 
                   younger boys speaks up.

 YOUNG BOY                              This is from all of us.

 PICARD                              Thank you... I can't imagine what 
                             it is.

                   Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century 
                   SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational 
                   instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and 
                   gleaming brass.

 YOUNG BOY                                      (excited)
                             It's a sack-tent!

                   Picard eyes it with delight.

 PICARD                              You mean a sextant. And it's a 
                             handsome one at that... from about 
                             eighteen twenty, I'd say. 
                             Wherever did you find it?

 GIRL                              It's a secret.

 PICARD                                      (smiles)
                             Oh, a secret... well, that makes 
                             it a doubly special gift. Thank 
                             you... thank you all...

                   The children react with pleasure. They cluster around 
                   him, showering him with hugs and kisses.

 CHILDREN                              Merry Christmas, Papa... I love 
                             You, Father... etc.

                   Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection. 
                   The children pull back and return to their own 
                   presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion 
                   as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played 
                   out.

 WOMAN                                      (to Picard)
                             I'll go get dinner ready.
                             they'll be starving in a minute.

                   Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks 
                   around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.

                   The children continue to chatter and laugh among 
                   themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious 
                   Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks 
                   over the ornaments and decorations...

 156 PICARD'S POV 156 
                   of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of 
                   color and light.

 157 PICARD 157 
                   His eye is caught by something in particular on the 
                   tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it.

 158 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 158 
                   His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the 
                   top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass 
                   ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a 
                   star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT...
                   and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands 
                   outward into the glass sphere.

                   It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is 
                   reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the 
                   movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way 
                   the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many 
                   ornaments on the tree.

 159 PICARD 159 
                   reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve 
                   within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something 
                   he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an 
                   otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the 
                   reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it 
                   aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands 
                   and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby 
                   window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow 
                   soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.

 160 PICARD'S POV (VFX-P) 160                    reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the 
                   ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes 
                   that this image is not going to go away... he can't 
                   hide from it.

 PICARD                              No... this isn't right... this 
                             can't be real...

 GUINAN'S VOICE                              It's as real as you want it to be.

                   Picard turns to see

 161 GUINAN (VFX-P) 161 
                   standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit 
                   seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B. 
                   As they talk, the children and the woman continue to 
                   move about their business as if Picard and Guinan 
                   aren't there.

                   Picard is stunned.

 PICARD                              Guinan... what's going on? Where 
                             am I?

 GUINAN                              You're in the Nexus.

                   Picard looks around.

 PICARD                              This... is the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              For you. This is where you wanted 
                             to be...

 PICARD                              But I never had a wife, children, 
                             a home like this...

 GUINAN                              Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...

                   Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on 
                   Guinan.

 PICARD                              Guinan, what are you doing here? 
                             I thought you were on the 
                             Enterprise.
 GUINAN                              I am on the Enterprise...I am 
                             also here. 
                                     (off his puzzled look) 
                             Think of me as... an "echo" of the 
                             person you know... a part of her
                             she left behind...

 PICARD                              Left behind...?

 GUINAN                              When the Enterprise-B beamed us 
                             off the Lakul, we were partially 
                             in the Nexus. The transporters 
                             locked on to us... but somehow 
                             everyone left a part of themselves 
                             behind.

 PICARD                              Soran...?

 GUINAN                              All of us.

 PICARD                              Where is he now?

 GUINAN                              Wherever he wanted to be...

                   Guinan smiles at him.

 BOY'S VOICE                              Papa, help me build my castle!

                   Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play 
                   castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego". 
                   For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the 
                   warm embrace of the fantasy...

 PICARD                                      (to boy)
                             In a few minutes...

                   Picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay 
                   here becoming more powerful.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, awed, to 
                                      Guinan)
                             These are my children... my 
                             children...

 GUINAN                                      (smiles)
                             Yeah. They're great, aren't they? 
                             You can go back and see them 
                             born... go forward and see your 
                             grandchildren... time has no
                             meaning here.

 WOMAN'S VOICE                              Dinner's ready! Let's go!

                   There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. 
                   The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and 
                   takes his hand.

 BOY                              Papa... are you coming?

                   Picard looks down into the face of his child. His 
                   heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this 
                   out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few 
                   steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye 
                   is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a 
                   moment... torn between the two images. and then, in 
                   one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends 
                   down to the child...

 PICARD                              Go on... go on without me...

                   The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then 
                   obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room 
                   to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to 
                   steel his voice.

 PICARD                              Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?

 GUINAN                              Why would you want to leave?

 PICARD                                      (insistent)
                             Can I?

 GUINAN                              Yes... where would you go?

 PICARD                              I don't understand.

 GUINAN                              I told you, time has no meaning 
                             here. If you leave, you can go 
                             anywhere... any time.

                   Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
 PICARD                              I know exactly where I want to 
                             go... and when. Back to that 
                             mountaintop on Veridian Three...
                             before Soran put out the star. I 
                             have to stop him.

 GUINAN                              What makes you think things will 
                             be any different this time?

 PICARD                              You're right. I'll need help. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Guinan, will you come back with 
                             me? Together, we could --

 GUINAN                              I can't leave. I'm already there, 
                             remember?

                   Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives 
                   him an enigmatic smile.

 GUINAN                              I know just the guy.

                   Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen. 
                   Picard turns at the sound --

 162 EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY 162 
                   Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but
                   Architecturally striking house with spectacular views 
                   in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead, 
                   making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
                   cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is 
                   just starting to adjust to this sudden change in 
                   location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
                   from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to 
                   look around the corner and sees -

                   James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks 
                   exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the  
                   Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is 
                   vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying 
                   himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
                   labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's 
                   no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard 
                   recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
                   Century Starfleet officer.

 PICARD                              James Kirk.

                   Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. 
                   His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in    
                   Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the 
                   sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's
                   over-powered him.

 KIRK                              Beautiful day, isn't it?

 PICARD                              Yes... yes, it is.

                   Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.

 KIRK                              Do you mind?

                   It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk 
                   wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.

 PICARD                              Oh.

                   Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a 
                   vigorous chop with the axe.

 PICARD                              Captain, do you realize what --

                   But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.

 KIRK                              Wait a second. I think 
                             something's burning.

                   Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of 
                   one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the 
                   house, and Picard follows...

 163 INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 163 
                   Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century 
                   with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an 
                   antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles 
                   and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the 
                   doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some 
                   stranger's house.

                   Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. 
                   It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, 
                   waves the smoke away with his hand. 

 KIRK                              Looks like someone was cooking 
                             eggs... 
                                     (to Picard) 
                             Come on in, it's all right. This 
                             is my house -- or at least it used 
                             to be, I sold it years ago.

                   Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's 
                   going on.

 PICARD                              I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the 
                             starship Enterprise.

                   Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK
                   on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves 
                   to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and 
                   wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning 
                   to connect with things and memories from his past.

 KIRK                              This clock... I gave this clock to 
                             Bones...

 PICARD                                      (pressing on)
                             I'm from what you would consider 
                             the future... the twenty-fourth
                             century.

                   Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in 
                   his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and 
                   sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both 
                   look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets 
                   Kirk with enthusiasm.

 KIRK                                      (affectionately)
                             Jake! Jake, you miserable old 
                             Mutt... How can you be here? 
                                     (to Picard)
                             He's been dead seven years.

                   Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we 
                   hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that 
                   stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see 
                   the shock on Kirk's face.

 ANTONIA'S VOICE                              Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How 
                             long are you going to be rattling 
                             around that kitchen?

                   A beat.

 KIRK                                      (amazed)
                             That's Antonia...

                   Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to 
                   realize something.

 KIRK                              Wait a minute...

                   Kirk glances at Picard.

 KIRK                              The future... what are you 
                             talking about? This is the 
                             past...

                   Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a 
                   HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This 
                   confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.

 KIRK                              This is nine years ago... the day 
                             I told her I was going back to
                             Starfleet...

                   Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by 
                   memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the 
                   frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden 
                   burst of recognition.

 KIRK                              These were Ktarian eggs -- her 
                             favorite.I was cooking them to 
                             soften the blow... 
                                     (re: horseshoe) 
                             And I gave her this.

                   Picard steps in.

 PICARD                              I know how real this must seem to 
                             you, but it's not. This isn't 
                             Really your house. We've both   
                             been caught up in some sort of 
                             temporal nexus.

                   But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being 
                   swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the
                   opportunity he suddenly has.

 KIRK                              Dill weed.

                   Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to 
                   it.

 KIRK                              There's a bottle of dill weed on 
                             the second shelf to the left, 
                             right behind the nutmeg.

                   Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. 
                   He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins  
                   preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then 
                   goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it 
                   to Kirk.

 PICARD                              How long have you been here?

                   Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.

 KIRK                              I don't know. I was on the 
                             Enterprise-B... in the deflector 
                             control room... keep stirring 
                             these, will you?

                   Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a    
                   breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, 
                   but stirs the eggs anyway.

 KIRK                                      (continuing)
                             The bulkhead in front of me 
                             Disappeared... then I was out 
                             there chopping wood. 
                                     (back to stove) 
                             Thanks.

                   Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.

 PICARD                              History records that you died 
                             saving the Enterprise-B from an 
                             energy ribbon eighty years ago...

                   But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is  
                   Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a
                   distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the 
                   plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
                   tray.

 KIRK                                      (amused)
                             So you're telling me this is the 
                             twenty-fourth century... and I'm 
                             dead?
 PICARD                              Not exactly. As I said, this is 
                             some kind of...

 KIRK                              Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you. 
                                     (frowns at tray) 
                             Something's missing...

                   Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- 
                   as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins 
                   and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the 
                   tray and heads for the door.

 PICARD                              Captain, I need your help. I want 
                             you to leave the Nexus with me.

                   Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...

 164 INT. KIRK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 164 
                   Kirk and Picard both on the move. Kirk heading for a 
                   staircase.

 PICARD                              We have to go back to a planet 
                             called Veridian III and stop a 
                             man from destroying a star. There 
                             are millions of lives at stake.

                   Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go 
                   away.

 KIRK                              You said history considers me 
                             dead. Who am I to argue with 
                             history?

 PICARD                              You're a Starfleet Officer and you 
                             have a duty to --

 KIRK                                      (hard)
                             I don't need to be lectured by 
                             you. I was out saving the galaxy 
                             when your grandfather was still in 
                             diapers. And frankly, I think the 
                             galaxy owes me one 
                                     (beat) 
                             I was like you once... so worried 
                             about duty and obligations that I 
                             couldn't see anything past this 
                             uniform. And in the end, what did 
                             it get me? Nothing. Not this 
                             time.

                   Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the 
                   stairs.

 KIRK                                      (looking up the stairs)
                             I'm going to walk up these stairs, 
                             march into that bedroom and tell
                             Antonia that I want to marry her.

                   Kirk begins to climb the stairs.

 KIRK                               This time things are going to be 
                              different.

                   He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind 
                   him. Picard glances around the room in frustration, 
                   then gets a determined look on his face and marches up 
                   the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it 
                   and steps through the door into

 165 INT. BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 165 
                   Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway 
                   of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm 
                   implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in 
                   through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with 
                   a few horses visible. 

                   Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks 
                   surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the
                   tray of food.

 PICARD                                      (re: barn)
                             This doesn't look like your 
                             bedroom.

                   Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to 
                   fall into place. He smiles with a growing 
                   realization...

 KIRK                              No... no, it's not. It's better.

 PICARD                              Better?

 KIRK                              This is my uncle's barn in Iowa...

                   He points to a horse with a saddle on it.

 KIRK                                      (re: horse)
                             I took that horse out for a ride 
                             seven years ago... on a spring 
                             day.

                   Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a  
                   beautiful spring day.
 KIRK                              Just like this. If I'm right, 
                             this is the day I met Antonia.

                   He turns to Picard.

 KIRK                              This Nexus of yours is very 
                             clever. I can start all over 
                             again -- do things right from day 
                             one.

                   Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and 
                   rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard 
                   watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the 
                   other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and
                   then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...
 CUT TO: 
 166 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (VFX-P) 166 
                   Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
                   and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and 
                   finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large 
                   RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He 
                   spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse 
                   is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the 
                   precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
                    Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse 
                   on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come 
                   over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. 
                   Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...
                   and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a 
                   moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the 
                   ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something 
                   about that jump is nagging at him...

                   He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. 
                   The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the  
                   ravine. 

                   Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the 
                   horse makes the LEAP across yet again.

                   This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an   
                   immediate stop. We can see on his face that something 
                   is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with 
                   a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.

                   In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a 
                   horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a 
                   long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by 
                   side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
                   feelings...

 KIRK                                      (re: ravine)
                             I must have made this jump fifty 
                             times. and every time it scared 
                             the hell out of me. But not this 
                             time.
                                     (beat) 
                             Because... it's not real.

                   A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular 
                   hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the 
                   bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see 
                   the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.
 PICARD                                      (re: woman)
                             Antonia?

 KIRK                                      (nods)
                             She's not real either, is she? 
                             Nothing here is... nothing here 
                             matters...

                   All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of 
                   self-revelation. He glances around.

 KIRK                              It's kinda like... orbital 
                             skydiving. Exciting for a few 
                             minutes... but in the end, you 
                             haven't really done anything...
                             you haven't made a difference...

                   Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, 
                   he's truly seeing him for the first time.

 KIRK                              Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              Close to retirement?

 PICARD                              I hadn't planned on it.

                   There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't 
                   seen until now.

 KIRK                              Well, let me tell you something - 
                             don't. Don't let them promote 
                             you... don't let them transfer 
                             you... don't let anything take you 
                             off the Bridge of that ship... 
                                     (beat) 
                             Because while you're there, you 
                             can make a difference.

                   The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard 
                   hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the 
                   whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there 
                   is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and  
                   determination.

 PICARD                              You don't need to be on the Bridge 
                             of a starship. Come with me. 
                             Help me stop Soran. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Make a difference again.

                   A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly,  
                   unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.

 KIRK                              How can I argue with the Captain 
                             of the Enterprise? 
                                     (a beat)
                             What was the name of that 
                             Planet... Veridian III?

 PICARD                              That's right.

 KIRK                              I take it the odds are against us,
                             and the situation is grim?

 PICARD                              You could say that.

 KIRK                                      (musing)
                             Of course, if Spock were here, 
                             he'd say I was being an 
                             irrational, illogical human for 
                             wanting to go on a mission like 
                             that...

                   And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his 
                   eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.

 KIRK                              Sounds like fun.

                   The two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as 
                   they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE
                   SCREEN, as seen before.

 FADE TO RED 
 FADE IN: 
 167 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P) 167 
                   Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing 
                   Picard.

 SORAN                              Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, 
                             I have an appointment with 
                             Eternity and I don't want to be 
                             late.

                   We realize we are watching the same events play out 
                   again.

                   Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding 
                   toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the 
                   ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath 
                   the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the 
                   field...

 167A SORAN (VFX-P) 167A 
                   turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then 
                   draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard.

 167B THE GROUND (VFX-P) 167B 
                   is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, 
                   obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily.

                    -- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his  
                       hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived. 

                   Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris.
                     -- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with
                       several feet of the ground where he was crawling.

 167C SORAN (VFX-I) 167C 
                   Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON,
                   then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT
                   kicks him in the head.

 168 REVEAL KIRK 168 
                   who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men 
                   begin to fight.

 169 NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 169 
                   as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up 
                   onto the control platform and desperately begins trying 
                   to shut down the launcher...

                   The following happens very quickly:

                   -- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.

                   -- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense 
                      of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is 
                      bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and 
                      alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues 
                      to race by.

 169A THE SKY (VFX-I) 169A 
                   the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...

 169B THE MOUNTAINTOP 169B 
                   Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it 
                   to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon...

                   -- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. 
                      Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting 
                      buttons...looking for other control panels, anything 
                      to affect the launcher.

 169C ANGLE (VFX-P) 169C 
                   Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the 
                   screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in 
                   the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR.

 169D PICARD (VFX-P) 169D 
                   begins working the control panel... desperate... he 
                   looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the 
                   probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is 
                   left standing on an invisible platform three feet in 
                   the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to 
                   do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of 
                   the controls.

                   -- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. 
                      Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk 
                      stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back 
                      in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the
                      movie.

 PICARD                                      (desperate)
                             Kirk -- there's a control PADD in 
                             his right pocket!

 169E KIRK (VFX-P) 169E                    sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, 
                   pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He 
                   begins working it...

 170 CLOSE ON SORAN 170                    His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks 
                   around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet 
                   away, just beyond his reach...

 171 THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P) 171 
                   Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.

 171A KIRK (VFX-P) 171A 
                   he smiles.

 KIRK                              The twenty-fourth century isn't so 
                             tough.

                   Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from 
                   behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor 
                   in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the 
                   weapon at Picard.

 172 MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE 172 
                   The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame. 
                   Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs 
                   into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads 
                   toward the sun...

 172A THE PROBE (VFX-I) 172A 
                   makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down 
                   toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the 
                   probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We 
                   hear a muffled explosion.

 172B SORAN (VFX-I) 172B 
                   can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks 
                   into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking 
                   overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he 
                   rushes to the top of the scaffolding.
 173 PICARD 173 
                   moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes 
                   flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly 
                   wounded.

 174 SORAN (VFX-I) 174 
                   is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward 
                   the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare
                   hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.

 SORAN                              No...

                   His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns 
                   to Picard.

 SORAN YOU!! 
 174B NEW ANGLE (VFX-P) 174B 
                   He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the 
                   scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He 
                   GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES
 SORAN IN MID-AIR . 
                   Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. 
                   The pocket watch has been shattered.

 175 PICARD 175 
                   turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his 
                   lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged 
                   breath.

 KIRK                              Nice shot.

                   Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.

 PICARD                              I'll find a way to contact the 
                             Enterprise. You're going to be 
                             all right.

 KIRK                              Did we do it? Did we make a 
                             Difference...?

 PICARD                              Yes. 
                                     (beat) 
                             Thank you.

 KIRK                              Least I could do...for a Captain 
                             of the Enterprise.

                   Kirk coughs again

 PICARD                              Try to hang on.
                    Kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his 
                   face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his 
                   face

 KIRK                              It was fun.

                   Kirk dies.

                   Hold te scene for a long moment, the two men in the 
                   quiet clearing.

                   as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones. 
                   MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few 
                   rocks on Kirk's grave.

                   He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command
                   insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave...
                   and stands there silently for a few moments.

                   A distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks 
                   up into the sky...

 177 PICARD'S POV (VFX-I) 177 
                   An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky 
                   toward the mountaintop.

 178 EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET 178 
                   The shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as 
                   Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D. 
                   security guards jump out to meet him.

 WORF                              Captain, are you all right?

 PICARD                              Yes.

 LA FORGE                              What about Doctor Soran?

 PICARD                              You needn't worry about the Doctor 
                             anymore.

                   Picard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he 
                   notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and 
                   notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on 
                   his face and Worf's uniform is torn.

 PICARD                              Was there a problem with the 
                             Klingons?

                   Worf and La Forge exchange a look.

 GEORDI                              You could say that...

                   Picard and Riker are sifting through the rubble of what 
                   once was the Ready Room, looking for something...

                   Riker sees something in the rubble.

 RIKER                              Is this it?

                   Riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier.

 PICARD                                      (relieved)
                             Yes, Number One. Thank you.

                   He takes the album... brushes off the dust and flips 
                   through the pages for a moment. Riker looks around the  
                   wrecked room.

 RIKER                              I'm going to miss this ship. She 
                             went before her time.

                   Picard has been rejuvenated by his experience... given 
                   a new perspective on the issues of life and death.

 PICARD                              It's not how many years you've 
                             lived, Wil... but how you've lived 
                             them.
                                     (beat) 
                             Someone once told me that time is 
                             a predator that stalks us all our 
                             lives. But maybe time is also a 
                             companion who goes with us on 
                             our journey, and reminds us to 
                             cherish the moments of our 
                             lives... because they will never 
                             come again. 
                                     (beat) 
                             We are after all. only mortal.

                   A quiet moment... Riker finally smiles.

 RIKER                              Speak for yourself, sir. I kinda 
                             planned on living forever.

                   Picard smiles back at him and the two men EXIT to...

 184 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P) 184 
                   Riker and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room. They look 
                   around the wrecked Bridge for a moment. Riker glances 
                   at the captain's chair.

 RIKER                              I always thought I'd have a crack 
                             at this chair one day.

 PICARD                              You may still... somehow I doubt 
                             this will be the last ship to 
                             carry the name Enterprise.

                   A beat, then Picard hits his combadge.

 PICARD                                      (continuing, to com)
                             Picard to Farragut. Two to beam 
                             up.

                   The two men dematerialize.

 FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY

Life.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse
finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.

CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying
and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy
of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures
lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.

We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.

The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

EXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT

Labor...

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.

The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.

Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
CREDITS end as we go to...

EXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET

The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan
Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of
this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the
horizon.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET

SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s.

                     SENATOR 1
          ... but if we hesitate we'll lose
          this important source of dilithium.
          A trade agreement is in the best
          interests of the Empire.

                     SENATOR 2
          Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a
          diplomatic mission to Celes II to
          open negotiations.

Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
Praetor Hiren glances to her.

                     PRAETOR
          Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
          the motion.

                     TAL'AURA
          No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"
          is to be advised.  I support all
          "diplomatic" overtures.  But if you
          will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
          appointment with the Tholian
          ambassador.

The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...

                     PRAETOR
          Then I will call for a vote on the
          motion to open trade negotiations
          with Celes II...

The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.

The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then "legs" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.

Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.

And then just as suddenly the light disappears.

A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.

                     PRAETOR
          Would someone please tell me what
          that was?
               (he turns to a guard)
          Alert security --

A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...

                     PRAETOR
          -- and have them run a --

The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt
from his face.

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every
living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It
disappears.

And the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY

JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in
Starfleet.

His face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress
uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.

He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been
the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.

                     PICARD
          Duty...

He lets the word resonate and then continues.

                     PICARD
          A starship captain's life is filled
          with solemn duty.  I have commanded
          men in battle.  I have negotiated
          peace treaties between implacable
          enemies.  I have represented the
          Federation in first contact with
          twenty-seven alien species.  But
          none of this compares to my solemn
          duty as... Best man.

Uproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding
reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.

The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other "Star Trek" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table.

                     PICARD
          Now, I know that on an occasion
          such as this: it is expected that I
          be gracious and fulsome with praise
          on the wonders of this blessed
          union... But have you two
          considered what you're doing to?
          This is all a damned
          inconvenience...
               (laughter from the crowd)
          While you're happily settling in on
          the Titan, I'll have to train a new
          first officer; no doubt a stern
          martinet who'll quote the rule book
          at me and never... ever... allow me
          to go on away missions.
               (laughter)
          ... Then there's the matter of my
          new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
          soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
          be probing into my darkest psyche
          as she nods her head and coos
          sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
          Deanna?

Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!

                     PICARD
          I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
          with the rest of you.  As most of
          you know, the doctor will also soon
          be leaving the Enterprise, to
          assume command of Starfleet
          Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
          Beverly, have you considered what
          you're doing to little ole' me?!
          I'll probably get some old battle-
          axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
          eat my vegetables and put me on
          report if I don't show up for my
          physical on time!

                     BEVERLY
          It'll serve you right.

Laughter, laughter, laughter!  He looks to Riker and Deanna:

                     PICARD
          Really, it's not too late to
          reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.

                     PICARD
          Will Riker, you have been my
          trusted right arm for fourteen
          years; you have helped keep my
          course true and steady.  Deanna
          Troi, you have been my conscience
          and best guide, the touchstone to
          the better parts of myself.  You
          are my family.  And in proper
          maritime tradition I wish you full
          sails and a clear horizon... My
          friends, make it so.

They drink.

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

The party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a
beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen
everywhere around us.

DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.

                     BEVERLY
               (playfully)
          Sort of like losing a son and
          gaining an empath, isn't it?

                     PICARD
          Please, Beverly, this is hard
          enough.

                     BEVERLY
          If you start tearing up I promise
          to beam you out.  Level one medical
          emergency.  There's no crying in
          Starfleet.

They head off toward Riker and Deanna.

Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.

                     LEAH
          I've never seen your Captain so
          nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
          in his old age.

                     GEORDI
               (laughs)
          Not likely.  After we installed the
          new Series Four replicators, he
          tried to order his usual tea and
          there was a glitch.  Had us remove
          the whole bunch of them and put the
          old ones back in.

                     LEAH
          There!  Nostalgic about old
          replicators.

                     GEORDI
          He just likes things the way he
          likes them...
               (he looks at her, smiles)
          Of course, so do I.

He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is
still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down
beside them, belches.

                     WORF
          Romulan ale should be illegal.

                     GEORDI
          It is, old chum.

                     WORF
          Then it should be more illegal.

He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's
going to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to
Picard and Beverly.

                     DEANNA
          Really, Captain, it was a lovely
          toast.

                     PICARD
          The least I could do for you,
          Deanna.  Besides, you know me...
          I'm a talking head.

                     DEANNA
          And you needn't worry.  I'll brief
          your new counselor on everything
          she needs to know.

                     PICARD
          The hell you will.  You know too
          much about me as it is... Now you
          promised there are no speeches
          during the ceremony on Betazed.

                     RIKER
          No, no speeches.  No clothes
          either.
               (winks, mischievously)

Picard looks at him.  Deanna laughs.

Then the band stops playing.  All turn.

DATA stands with the band.

                     DATA
          Ladies and Gentlemen and invited
          Tran gendered species... In my
          study of Terran and Betazoid
          conjugal rites I have discovered it
          is traditional to present the
          "happy couple" with a gift.  Given
          Commander Riker's affection for
          archaic musical forms I have
          elected to present the following as
          my gift in honor of their
          conjugation.

Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation?

Data turns to the band leader.

                     DATA
          If you please, Mister Band Leader,
          a-one and a-two and...

The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving
Berlin standard "Blue Skies."

                     DATA
               (sings)
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see.  Blue
          birds, singing a song, Nothing but
          blue birds all day long.  Never saw
          the sun shining so bright, Never
          saw things going so right..."

The crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he
momentarily raises his head from the table.

                     WORF
               (groans)
          Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:

                     DEANNA
               (smiles)
          All right, go ahead.

Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts
jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          May I have this dance?

                     DEANNA
          With pleasure, Captain.

Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
Beverly goes to Worf.

                     BEVERLY
          Commander Worf... Do Klingons
          swing?

                     WORF
          I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

                     BEVERLY
          Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

She pulls him to the dance floor as:

                     BEVERLY
          I'm so glad you made it back to the
          Enterprise before I left.

                     WORF
          I was not suited for the life of
          a... diplomat.

                     BEVERLY
               (wry)
          Who'd have guessed?

They dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them.

And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the
crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people.

This family.  A family we love.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise streaks through space.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.

As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still
somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and
idiosyncratic zest for life.

Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.

                     PICARD
          I've been saving this.  Chateau
          Picard 2267.  Batten down the
          hatches...

He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:

                     PICARD
          They say a vintner's history is in
          every glass.  The soil he came
          from.  His past as well as his
          hopes for the future.

He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a
toast.

                     PICARD
          So... To happy endings.

                     DATA
          To happy endings.

Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally
swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh.

Data mimics Picard.  Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor
and finally swallowing.  Ahhh.

                     DATA
          Sir.  I noticed an interesting
          confluence of emotion at the
          wedding.  I am familiar with the
          human concept of tears through
          laughter and its inverse, laughter
          through tears, but I could not help
          wondering about the human capacity
          for expressing both pleasure and
          sadness simultaneously.

                     PICARD
          I understand why it would seem
          confusing.  Certain human rituals --
          like weddings, birthdays or
          funerals evoke strong and very
          complex emotions.  These rites
          carry great weight with us because
          they denote the passage of time.

                     DATA
          And you were particularly aware of
          this feeling because Commander
          Riker will be leaving to assume
          command of the Titan?

                     PICARD
          Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
          Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
          Medical...

                     DATA
          And this makes you "sad"?

                     PICARD
          Well.  I suppose it does a bit.
          I'm very happy for them, of course,
          but I'm going to miss them.  The
          ship will seem... incomplete
          without them.

                     DATA
          That is because you have a
          familiarity with them.  You can
          predict specific reactions and
          behavior and are comfortable in
          that knowledge.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
          well.  They've made important
          choices; they're going to have
          great challenges ahead of them.
          New worlds to conquer...

He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          Seeing Will and Deanna today made
          me think about some of the choices
          I've made in my own life.  Devoting
          myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
          or having children... All the
          choices that led me here.

A beat.  Data thinks about it.

                     DATA
          The choices I made have led me here
          as well.  This is the only home I
          have ever known.  I cannot foresee
          a reason for leaving.

                     PICARD
          You never know what's over the
          horizon, Data.  Before too long
          you'll be offered a command of your
          own.  Data looks at him; he has
          never really considered this.

                     DATA
          If I were... I believe my memory
          engrams would sense the absence of
          your specific reactions and
          behavior.  I would "miss you."

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Now, you make a toast.

                     DATA
          To new worlds...

                     PICARD
          New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new
          worlds...

They drink.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial
splendor of a Senate corridor.

COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the
corridor.

Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention
to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry
sense of humor.

                     SURAN
          The fleet commanders are nervous.
          They've agreed to remain at their
          given coordinates and await his
          orders.  But they're anxious to
          know what's going on here.

                     DONATRA
          I don't blame them.  We can't keep
          them in the dark forever.

A voice, from the shadows:

                     VICEROY (V.O.)
          But in darkness, there is strength.

Donatra and Suran stop.

And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...

He is a terrifying sight  A powerful, monstrous alien
creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a
disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.  He is
vampiric and lethal.  He is a Reman.

                     VICEROY
          Don't you agree?

He leads them along the corridor.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey
clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem
from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.  As we hear:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Consider it  The great symbol of
          the Empire... But the bird-of-prey
          holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.
          Their destinies conjoined...

And then we see him... SHINZON!

He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.  Very handsome
with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.  He
wears a striking Reman military uniform.

He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.  The
entire floor is a large star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Yet for generations one of those
          planets has been without a voice.
          We will be silent no longer.

Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon
in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN
COMMANDERS sit.

Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the
chamber.  They are his sinister children of the night.  Even
more chilling now in the flickering torch light.  It's like
something out of Tim Burton.

Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Join us, Commanders.  Now what's
          the disposition of the fleet?

                     SURAN
          They're holding position.

                     SHINZON
          And?

                     SURAN
               (bows his head)
          They will obey, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          It's imperative we retain their
          allegiance or our great mission
          will be strangled before it can
          truly draw breath.

                     DONATRA
          They support your intentions, sir.
          But they require evidence of
          your... sincerity.

Shinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to
respond with benevolence.  He smiles.

                     SHINZON
          And they'll have it.
               (he begins to pace over
                the star chart)
          Tell the fleet that the days of
          negotiation and diplomacy are over.
          The Almighty Federation will fall
          before us.  As I promised you.

He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral
Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          The time we have dreamed of is at
          hand.  The time... of conquest.
               (sinister laugh)

He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the
Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Cut off the dragon's head and it
          cannot strike back.

A beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his
quiet words disturbs her.

                     SURAN
          How many Warbirds will you need?

                     SHINZON
          None.

They look at him, stunned.

                     SURAN
          Praetor.  You have the whole fleet
          at your disposal.  They supported
          the coup, they'll follow you.

                     SHINZON
          The Scimitar will serve my needs.

                     SURAN
          But surely --

                     SHINZON
          I came this far alone...
               (he looks at his Reman
                warriors)
          We came this far alone.  We require
          no assistance from the fleet.  Now
          leave me to my thoughts.

The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon
looks to his Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Are we prepared?

                     VICEROY
          Yes, Praetor.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          So many years for this moment.
               (he looks up at his
                Viceroy, smiles)
          Bring him to me.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the
bridge.

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          I won't do it.

                     DEANNA
          It's tradition,Worf.  You of all
          people should appreciate that!
               (whispers)
          Besides, I've already seen it.

                     WORF
          A warrior does not appear without
          his clothing.  It leaves him...
          vulnerable.

                     RIKER
          I don't think we're going to see
          much combat on Betazed.

                     DEANNA
          Don't be too sure.  Mother will be
          there.

Worf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:

                     WORF
          I won't do it.

                     PICARD
          Won't do what, Mister Worf?

                     WORF
          Captain.  I think it is
          inappropriate for a Starfleet
          officer to appear...
               (hates the word)
          ... naked.

                     PICARD
          Come now, a big, strapping fellow
          like you?  What are you afraid of?

Deanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his
attention:

                     WORF
          I'm picking up an unusual
          electromagnetic signature from the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What sort of signature?

Worf looks up.  Glances at Data.

                     WORF
          Positronic.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER

Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and
Data.

                     GEORDI
          It's very faint but I've isolated
          it to the third planet in the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the planet?

                     GEORDI
          Uncharted.  We'll have to get
          closer for a more detailed scan.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Theories?

                     DATA
          Since positronic signatures have
          only been known to emanate from
          androids such as myself, it is
          logical to theorize that there is
          an android such as myself on
          Kolarus III.

                     GEORDI
          How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

                     DATA
          I thought only me, myself and Lore.

                     RIKER
               (looking at star chart)
          Diverting to the Kolarin system
          takes us awfully close to the
          Romulan Neutral Zone.

                     PICARD
               (looking at star chart)
          Still well on our side...

Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire
to explore this possible connection to others like himself.

                     PICARD
          I think it's worth a look.  Don't
          worry, Number One, we'll get you to
          Betazed with time to spare.

                     RIKER
          Thank you, sir...

                     PICARD
               (to all, especially Worf)
          Where we will all honor the
          Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,
          or any other parts of our anatomy.
          Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be
          in the gym.

He goes.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm Officer)
          Mister Branson, set course for the
          Kolarin system.  Warp Five --
               (Deanna shoots him a
                glance)
          -- Warp Seven.

                     HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
          Plotted and laid in, sir.

                     RIKER
          Engage.

                     DEANNA
          You better believe you're engaged!

Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station,
studying the displays.

                     GEORDI
          What do you think, Data, a long-
          lost relative?

Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is
apparent.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.  In
the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion
storm.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond
it.

                     GEORDI
          I read six distinct positronic
          signatures, spread out over a few
          kilometers on the surface.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the
          population?

                     DATA
          Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It
          appears to be a pre-warp
          civilization at an early stage of
          industrial development.

                     GEORDI
          Captain, I don't recommend
          transporting, that ion storm
          doesn't look very neighborly.  It
          could head this way without much
          warning.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Data, Worf, you're
          with me.

Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.

                     RIKER
               (stands, protesting)
          Captain, I hope I don't have to
          remind you --

                     PICARD
          I appreciate your concern, Number
          One, but I've been itching to try
          out the Argo.

                     RIKER
          Sir --

                     PICARD
          Captain's prerogative, Will.
          There's no foreseeable danger...
          and your wife would never forgive
          me if anything happened to you.

He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.

                     PICARD
          You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

The turbolift doors slide shut.

The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to
house husband.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY

The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle
Argo emerges.

The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly
large cargo area at the back.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY

The Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert
environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death
Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The
shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay,
then...

The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf
roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!

Picard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a
mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a
Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The
Rat Patrol."

Picard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of
dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the
positronic signatures with a tricorder:

                     DATA
          The closest signature is two
          kilometers to the west... that
          direction, sir.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Data.
               (he smiles)
          Let's see what she can do.

He roars off in a cloud of dust!

Picard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert
terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited
driving panache.

Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar

                     DATA
          I will always be baffled by the
          human predilection for piloting
          vehicles at unsafe velocities.

Picard smiles and drives a little faster.

                     DATA
               (monitoring with
                tricorder)
          Over that rise, sir... half a
          kilometer.

They continue on.  Before long they can see something on the
level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to
discover...

An android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground.

                     DATA
          It appears to be...
               (he scans with his
                tricorder)
          ... an arm.

                     WORF
               (suspicious)
          Why is it moving?

                     DATA
          Like me, it has been designed with
          modular power sources.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, if you please.

Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up,
the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from
a horror movie.  Worf shudders.

He returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the
rear cargo area.

                     DATA
          The next signature is one kilometer
          to the south.

Picard starts the jeep in motion.

Time passes as they continue on... coming across another
arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various
disassembled components of a Data-like android!

EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY

Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is
only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep
into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder,
pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the
sides of the canyon.

                     DATA
          The final signature is
          approximately 300 meters up that
          incline.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

                     WORF
               (uneasy)
          To find the head, sir?

                     PICARD
               (amused)
          If you don't mind.

Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final
piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY

Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the
direction:

                     DATA
          Ten meters...

Worf pulls his phaser, ready.

                     DATA
          I think it unlikely you will need
          your phaser to recover the cranial
          unit.  Of course, it could bite
          you.

Then they see it.

Data's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in
the dust before them.

                     WORF
          It's you.

                     DATA
          The resemblance is... striking.

Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.  It looks up at them
with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.

                     HEAD
          Why am I looking at me?

                     DATA
          You are not looking at yourself.
          You are looking at me.

                     HEAD
               (looking at Worf)
          You do not look like me.

                     WORF
          No.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          I would like to pick you up now.
          May I do that?

                     HEAD
               (to Worf)
          You have a pretty shirt.

                     WORF
          Thank you.

Data gently picks up the head.  Looks at it.  The two
identical faces gaze at each other.

                     DATA
          Fascinating...

Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes.  Worf and Data
spin to see...

A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing
primitive plasma weapons --

Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep --
some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf
firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them --
through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:

                     HEAD
          I have two arms and ten fingers.
          Do you know where my arms are?  I
          cannot see where we are going.
          Where are we going?
               (Etc... like Threepio in
                "Empire" when he's
                strapped to Chewbacca's
                back.)

The action continues.  Then Data finds himself almost
surrounded --

                     DATA
          Commander!

Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a
perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf
catches it --

                     WORF
          STOP TALKING!

The head abruptly stops talking.

Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around
him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength
and agility.

Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like
a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally
firing his phaser --

They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble --
the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !

When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping
the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep,
firing the phaser canon.

Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the
front seat and roars off --

INT./ EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING

Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to
Data in the front seat:

                     WORF
          If you wouldn't mind.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

The head looks up at Picard.

                     HEAD
          You have a shiny head.

Picard glances at the head.

                     DATA
          He is very observant.

                     PICARD
          I can see that.

                      WORF
          Captain!

Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!  The aliens
are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Shall we try some "unsafe
          velocities?"

He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.

Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the
aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few
dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

Meanwhile:

                     HEAD
               (to Picard)
          You have a red shirt.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          This is not an appropriate time for
          a conversation.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because the captain has to
          concentrate on piloting the
          vehicle.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Data!

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.

They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and
flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade
their pursuers --

Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the
alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire --
Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating
adventure --

Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it
is surrounded by more of the aliens!

                     PICARD
          Mister Data.  Let's make like the
          wind.

Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the
Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --

Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the
rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --

Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain
as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the
aliens -- and into the cargo bay --

INT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as
the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.

Picard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of
dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.

Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.

                     WORF
               (smiles)
          He must have Klingon blood.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

Beverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her.

                     BEVERLY
          I think you have nicer eyes.

We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands
with Picard, Riker and Geordi.

                     DATA
          Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body
parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled

                     RIKER
          Geordi?

                     GEORDI
               (at work analyzing the
                torso section)
          Well, he seems to have the same
          internal mechanics as Data but not
          as much positronic development.
          The neural pathways aren't nearly
          as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a
          prototype.  Something Dr. Soong
          created before Data.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          Do you have a name, sir?

                     HEAD
          I am the B-9.

                     PICARD
          Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for
          whimsical names seems to have no
          end.

                     HEAD
               (to Riker)
          You have a fuzzy face.

                     PICARD
               (trying to ignore the
                head)
          Keep me informed, Number One, and,
          please, put him back together.

He goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece
by piece like the Tin Man as:

                     DATA
          Can you tell me how you came to be
          on the planet where we found you?

                     B-9
               (blandly)
          I was taken from my homeworld by
          people called the "PakJeds." They
          are fat.  They traded me to a ship
          belonging to the "Bolians." The
          "Bolians" are blue.  They put me in
          a seat and asked me questions.
          Then they were attacked by another
          ship...

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more
fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.

                     B-9
          Then people called the
          Delviciansans picked me up.  They
          have long teeth.  They asked if I
          do anything to help them.  I told
          them I could do whatever they
          wanted.  They asked me to clean out
          the matrix manifolds.  I told them
          I did not know what an Matrix
          manifold looks like.

                     BEVERLY
          Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics
          to run on some medical scanner
          things.

She quickly exits.

                     B-9
          And after they showed me the
          "engine manifolds." Then they
          showed me something called a
          "plasma mop"

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely
assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind.

                     B-9
          ... then the "Cardassians" put me
          into something called a "garbage
          chute" and I went out into space
          again --

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Worf to Commander Riker.  I have
          the tactical manifests ready, sir.

                     RIKER
               (quickly tapping his comm
                badge)
          Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right
          there!...
               (he stands)
          Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

He escapes.

                     B-9
          Fuzzy face is gone.

                     DATA
          Yes, please continue.

                     B-9
          I was in space for a long time.
          Then a ship belonging to the
          "Talosians" picked me up.  They
          asked me where I came from.  I told
          them people called the "Pakleds"
          took me from my homeworld.  They
          are fat...

Geordi groans.

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is
slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is
fully assembled.

                     B-9
          Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

A beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale...

                     DATA
          Do you know who I am?

                     B-9
          You are me.

                     DATA
          No.  My name is Data... I am your
          brother.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.

                     DEANNA
               (to Worf)
          ... and after the ceremony on
          Betazed, three entire weeks for our
          honeymoon.

                     RIKER
          We're going sailing on the Opal
          Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned
          solar catamaran.  Just us and the
          sun and the waves.

                     WORF
          It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

                     DEANNA
               (amused)
          It's meant to be relaxing.

                     WORF
          A Klingon honeymoon begins with the
          Kholamar desert march where the
          couple bonds in endurance trials.
          If they survive the challenge they
          move on to the Fire Caves of
          Fek'lhr to face the demons of
          Gre'thor.

                     RIKER
          Well, that sounds relaxing too.

                     WORF
          It is... invigorating.

They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.

                     RIKER
          So they've got him up and running.

                     WORF
          He's a very unusual android

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          Runs in the family.

They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs
him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data
shows him how use a napkin.

A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches
Data and the B-9.

There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other
somewhat like a slow, simple child.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Picard is at his replicator unit.

                     PICARD
          Earl Grey, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds.

                     PICARD
          Come.
               (Deanna enters)
          Counselor.

                     DEANNA
          Do you have a moment, sir?

                     PICARD
          Of course, sit down.

He sits at his desk  She sits across from him.

                     DEANNA
          It's about Data  I've watched him
          with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
          Data's desire for a "family" is
          very strong.  I'm afraid he may be
          investing too much in the B-9.

                     PICARD
          You're speaking of emotional
          investment?

                     DEANNA
          The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
          And Data, in his own way, has
          assumed the position of a parent or
          guardian.  I'm afraid he has
          expectations based on his own
          experiences.  He'll be disappointed
          when the B-9 cannot meet those
          expectations.

                     PICARD
          As much as we care for him,
          Deanna... we have to remember that
          Data isn't capable of
          disappointment.

                     DEANNA
          I don't believe that, sir.  We've
          shared many disappointing journeys.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          I'm going to miss you.

                     DEANNA
          And I you.

They are interrupted by a comm signal:

                     RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, you have an Alpha Priority
          communication from Starfleet
          Command.

                     PICARD
          Acknowledged...
               (Deanna stands)
          ... I'll talk to Data

                     DEANNA
          Thank you, sir.

She goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.

ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway
is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her
well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth
charm which made her a household name and beloved cult
figure.

                     PICARD
          Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip
          to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          With or without the rest of the
          fleet?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          A diplomatic mission.  We've been
          invited, believe it or not.  Seems
          there's been some kind of internal
          political shakeup.  The new
          Praetor, someone called Shinzon,
          has requested a Federation envoy.

                     PICARD
          New Praetor?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          There's more... as always.  He's
          Reman.
               (Picard is surprised)
          Believe me, we don't understand it
          either.  You're the closest ship so
          I want you to high tail it over
          there and hear what he has to say.
          Get the lay of the land, If the
          Empire becomes unstable, it could
          mean trouble for the entire
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
          Understood.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
          We're sending you all the
          intelligence we have, but it's not
          much.  I don't need to tell you to
          watch your back, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Not with the Romulans.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (smiles wryly)
          The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,
          the evil Soran and that pesky
          Nexus.  You seem to get all the
          easy assignments!

                     PICARD
          Just lucky, Admiral.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Let's hope that luck holds.
          Janeway out.

The transmission ends.

Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the
bridge

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard goes to his command chair:

                     PICARD
               (to Helm)
          Lay in a new course... Take us to
          Romulus.  Warp eight.

The crew is shocked.

                     HELM OFFICER
          Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and
          laid in...

                     RIKER
          Romulus?

                     PICARD
          I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have
          to wait, Number One... Engage.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a
flash of dazzling light.  Yes!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY

Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors
currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around
their sun.

                     DATA
          As you can see the habitable half
          of Remus is always in darkness
          because, like Mercury, one side
          always faces the sun.  Due to the
          extreme temperatures on that half
          of their world, the Remans live on
          the dark side of the planet.

Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate
Data's words:

                     DATA
          Almost nothing is known about the
          Reman homeworld, although
          intelligence scans have proven the
          existence of dilithium mining and
          heavy weapons construction.

Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely
make out the monstrous figures:

                     DATA
          The Remans themselves are
          considered an undesirable caste in
          the hierarchy of the Empire.

                     RIKER
          But they also have the reputation
          of being formidable warriors.  In
          the Dominion War, Reman forces were
          used as assault troops in the most
          violent encounters.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          Cannon fodder.

                     GEORDI
          Then how did a Reman get to be
          Praetor?  I don't get it.

                     RIKER
          We have to assume he had Romulan
          collaborators.

                     PICARD
          A coup d'etat?

                     RIKER
          The Praetor's power has always been
          the Romulan fleet.  They must be
          behind him.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          What have you learned about
          Shinzon?

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

                     DATA
          Starfleet intelligence was only
          able to provide a partial account
          of his military record.  We can
          infer he is relatively young and a
          capable commander.  He fought
          seventeen major engagements in the
          war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
          we know nothing.

                     PICARD
          Well... it seems we're truly
          sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
          it.  Anything you can give me would
          be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

                     DATA
          At present he serves no useful
          function.  Dr. Soong created us to
          become active and useful members of
          society.  I do not believe he would
          have wanted the B-9 to live out his
          life in his present state.

                     GEORDI
          I can't believe the Captain went
          along with a memory download.

                     DATA
          Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
          was probably designed with the same
          self-actualization parameters as
          myself.  If my memory engrams are
          successfully integrated into his
          positronic matrix, he should have
          all my abilities.

                     GEORDI
          He'd have all your memories too.
          You feel comfortable with that?

                     DATA
          I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
          belief that with my memory engrams
          he will be able to function as a
          more complete individual.

                     GEORDI
          An individual more like you, you
          mean.

                     DATA
          Yes.

                     GEORDI
          Maybe he's not supposed to be like
          you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
          just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

                     GEORDI
          Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

                     DATA
               (to B-9)
          Do you know where you are?

                     B-9
          I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

                     DATA
          Can you remember our father?

                     B-9
          No.

Data glances to Geordi.

                     DATA
          Do you know the name of the Captain
          of this vessel?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Is that your final answer?

                     GEORDI
               (to B-9)
          Do you know my name?

                     B-9
          You have a soft voice.

                     GEORDI
               (gently)
          Data, he's assimilating a lot of
          programming.  Remember, he's a
          prototype, a lot less sophisticated
          than you are.  We just don't know
          if his matrix will be able to
          adapt.  Or if he'll be able to
          retain anything.  We should give
          him some time.

Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.

                     DATA
          What purpose does this serve?

                     GEORDI
               (also examining circuitry)
          It seems to be a redundant memory
          port.  Maybe it's for provisional
          memory storage in case his neural
          pathways overload?

                     DATA
          Dr. Soong must have found it
          unnecessary in later versions.

                     GEORDI
          It's possible the extra memory port
          is interfering with the engram
          processing.  Mind if I keep him
          here and run some diagnostics?

                     DATA
          No, I do not mind.

Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.

                     DATA
          But I believe he will prove
          incapable of performing higher
          functions.

                     GEORDI
          Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,
          I know, you're not capable of hope.

                     DATA
               (looking at B-9)
          I am not.

Data stands.  The B-9 stands to follow.

                     DATA
          No, remain with Commander La Forge.
          He is going to try to make you
          well.

The B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen
in the distance.

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.
          The Enterprise has arrived at
          Romulus and is waiting at the
          designated coordinates.  All our
          hails have gone unanswered.  We've
          been waiting for seventeen hours.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew is tense.  Silence.

Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to
release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit.

                     RIKER
          Why don't they answer our hails?

                     PICARD
          It's an old psychological strategy,
          Number One.  To put him in a
          position of dominance and make us
          uneasy.

                     RIKER
          It's working.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          They're out there, sir.

Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at
Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
They're out there, Waiting.

                     WORF
          Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

                     PICARD
          Not yet, Mister Worf.

                     RIKER
          Captain, with all due respect to
          diplomatic protocols -- the
          Federation Council's not sitting
          out here, we are.

                     PICARD
          Patience.  Diplomacy is a very
          exacting occupation.  We can wait.

                     DATA
          Captain...

And on the viewscreen.

Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks
directly before the Enterprise.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely
breathtaking.

Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional
Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is
huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is
aggressive.  Awesome in its power.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
               (slowly rising from his
                chair)
          My God...

                     WORF
               (tense)
          Should I raise shields?

                     PICARD
          No!

                     WORF
          Captain -- !

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

                     WORF
               (quickly analyzing
                tactical display)
          Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-
          seven photon torpedo bays, primary
          and secondary phased shields.

                     RIKER
          She's not out for a pleasure
          cruise.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          She's a predator.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:

Shinzon's Viceroy.

He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.  The bridge is as unique
as the rest of Shinzon's ship.  Instead of the usual
mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost
Asian simplicity.  Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare
and elegant.

Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most
of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core
relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the
bridge.

The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of
the viceroy.

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Enterprise.  We are the Reman
          Warbird Scimitar.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I am not Shinzon.  I am his
          Viceroy.  We are sending transport
          coordinates.

The transmission ends abruptly.  The Scimitar reappears on
the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Not very chatty.

                     PICARD
          Away team.  Transporter room four.

Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the
turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The away team materializes in the most striking location on
Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.

It is a huge, empty chamber.  No furniture.  A simple Reman
mat on the floor is the only decoration.  At the very top of
the room there is a large, etched glass dome.

It is very dark.

They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you'll forgive the
          darkness... we're not comfortable
          in the light.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon?

Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more
illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.

The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is
evident he is human.  Assuming that he was Reman, they're
surprised by this realization.

Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a
moment.

                     SHINZON
          Captain Picard... Jean Luc
          Picard... I don't mean to stare,
          it's just -- well, you can't
          imagine how long I've been waiting
          for this moment.  I always imagined
          you taller, isn't that odd?
               (to Data)
          You may scan me without subterfuge,
          Commander Data.

Data scans him with a tricorder as:

                     PICARD
          And you're not as we imagined you.

                     SHINZON
          No?

                     WORF
          You are human.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Worf.
               (he speaks in Klingon)
          I greet you as a valiant warrior...
          and as my brother.

                     WORF
               (terse, in Klingon)
          I'll save my greetings for a better
          brother.

Shinzon laughs, maniacally.

                     PICARD
          Why have you asked for our presence
          here?

Shinzon does not answer.  He is staring deeply at Deanna,
moans softly.

                     PICARD
          Praetor?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I've never met a human woman.

He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.

                     DEANNA
          I'm only half human.

                     SHINZON
          Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic
          and telepathic abilities, ship's
          counselor.  All of this I knew...
          But I didn't know you were so
          beautiful.

                     RIKER
          You seem very familiar with our
          personnel.

Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from
her.

                     SHINZON
          I am, Commander Riker...
               (to Deanna)
          ... May I touch your hair?

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a
          matter we were -- assured was of
          great importance.  If you have
          anything to say to us as
          representatives of the Federation,
          I suggest you do so now.

Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.  It is strangely
seductive.  Almost disquieting in its intensity.  Deanna
handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.

                     SHINZON
               (softly)
          On the world I come from there's no
          light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't
          important.  I see now there's a
          world elsewhere.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to
          discuss your lack of a social life.

                     SHINZON
               (turning back to Picard)
          Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
               (he smiles)
          There's so much we have to talk
          about.

                     PICARD
          I would be interested to know what
          we are talking about.

                     SHINZON
          Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the
          walls between us to recognize we
          are one people.  Federation and
          Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and
          Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of
          the thing that makes us the same.
          We want peace.

Picard and the others are stunned.

                     SHINZON
          I want to end the centuries of
          mistrust.  I want to be your ally,
          not your enemy.  As a first step I
          propose we eliminate the Neutral
          Zone and begin a free and open
          exchange of goods and ideas.

                     PICARD
          And the Senate supports you?

                     SHINZON
               (dry)
          I have dissolved the Senate.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          Right now, you're thinking this all
          sounds too good to be true?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you're wondering why the
          Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this
          the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a
          predator?
               (Picard is startled at
                Shinzon's choice of
                words)
          ... But you're also thinking the
          chance for peace is too promising
          to ignore.  Above all, you're
          trying to decide if you can trust
          me.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          Then perhaps the time has come to
          add some illumination to our
          discussion.  Computer, raise
          lighting four levels.

Lights shoot up around the room.

For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard
actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the
crew doesn't understand his reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Allow me to tell you a story that I
          hope will clarify my position.
          When I was very young I was
          stricken with an odd disease.  I
          developed a hyper-sensitivity to
          sound.  The slightest whisper
          caused me agony...

Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense.

                     SHINZON
          No one knew what to do.  Finally I
          was taken to a doctor who had some
          experience with Terran illnesses
          and I was finally diagnosed with
          Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of
          it, Captain?

                     PICARD
          You know I do.

The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Then you know it's a very rare
          syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male
          members of my family had it.
          Eventually I was treated.  Now I
          can hear as well as you can,
          Captain.

He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.

                     SHINZON
          I can see as well as you can.  I
          can feel everything you feel.
               (He stops right before
                Picard)
          In fact, I feel exactly what you
          feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and
curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange,
remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his
at that age.

                     SHINZON
          Do you trust me now?

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We need to talk, just you and I.

                     SHINZON
          Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
          Just the two of us.  Or just the
          one of us.

                     PICARD
          You know I need to verify this.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to
outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife
and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife
to Data.

                     SHINZON
          Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so
          much to discuss.

Picard touches his communicator pin:

                     PICARD
          Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam
          out.

They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating
Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as
the transporter effect ripples around him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman
knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts
and analysis are visible.

                     BEVERLY
          There's no doubt, Captain.  Right
          down to your regressive strain of
          Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

A beat as the confirmation sinks in.

                     PICARD
          When was he... created?

                     BEVERLY
          About twenty-five years ago.  They
          probably used a hair follicle or
          skin cell.

                     PICARD
               (touching head)
          I think a skin cell's the more
          likely of the two.

                     RIKER
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Believe me, Number One; I'm going
          to find out.  Contact Starfleet
          Command and inform them of the
          situation.  I need to know where
          the hell he came from.  Deanna.

He goes, Deanna following.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

                     DEANNA
          I would say he's been trained to
          resist telepathy.  What I could
          sense of his emotions were erratic,
          very hard to follow.

                     PICARD
          Is he sincere about wanting peace?

                     DEANNA
          I don't know.
               (she stops him)
          Sir, the strongest sense I had was
          that he's more than curious about
          you.  He very much wants to know
          you.
               (she looks at him deeply)
          The same way you want to know him.

                     PICARD
          How could I not?

                     DEANNA
          Captain, don't assume he's anything
          like you are.  You should resist
          the urge to think you know him.

                     PICARD
          I not only know him, Deanna, I am
          him... and he is me!

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been
working for hours.

                     DEANNA
          Will, you need to rest.
               (he continues to work)
          As ship's counselor, I'm
          recommending you get me sleep.

Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up
her.

                     RIKER
          Some honeymoon.

She smiles and goes to him.

                     DEANNA
          We have time.
               (she kisses him)
          Come to bed.

She pulls him up.

                     RIKER
          Imzadi, what am I going to do with
          you?

They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they
fall into the bed.

It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him
sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but
something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond.

She starts back, her eyes growing wide.

Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon!

                     SHINZON
          Imzadi.  This is so good.

                     DEANNA
          No!

He caresses her face...

                     SHINZON
          He can never know you as I know
          you... He can never touch you as I
          touch you.

                     DEANNA
          This isn't real.

                     SHINZON
          Can you feel my hands... are they
          real?  Can you feel my lips, my
          loins?

He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It
is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She
is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all?

Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I'm with you, Imzadi...

And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:

                     SHINZON
          I'll always be with you now.  Now
          and forever...

                     DEANNA
          You sick bastard!

She pushes him away...

                     RIKER
          Deanna?!  What's with the name
          calling?

It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him
desperately.

EXT.  ROMULAN SENATE - DAY

The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon
is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator
Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely.

Commander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His
Viceroy lurks in a corner.

                     SURAN
          ... then I don't understand the
          reason for the delay!

                     SHINZON
          You don't have to understand.

                     SURAN
          And bringing the Enterprise here?!
          What possible purpose could that
          serve?!

                     SHINZON
          I have a purpose.

                     SURAN
          Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          Silence, Romulan!

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

                     SHINZON
          You must learn patience, Commander.
          Do you know where I learned it?  In
          the dilithium mines of Remus.
          Spend eighteen hours every day
          under the lash of a Romulan guard's
          whip and you'll soon understand
          patience.

                     SURAN
               (carefully bows his head)
          Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          Now go.  I have some personal
          business.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

                     DONATRA
          How long before he has us in the
          dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

                     SHINZON
          And when I was ready they were
          going to replace you with me, an
          exact biological duplicate.  Put a
          Romulan agent at the heart of
          Starfleet to influence your command
          structure.  It was a bold plan.

                     PICARD
          What happened?

                     SHINZON
          As happens so frequently here on
          Romulus, a new government came to
          power.  They decided to abandon the
          plan -- frankly, I think they were
          afraid I'd be discovered and it
          would lead to war.  They weren't
          ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

                     SHINZON
          Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I
          can't stand it.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          You'll acquire a taste for it.

A beat.  They look at each other.

                     SHINZON
          It's not quite the face you
          remember.

                     PICARD
          Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

                     SHINZON
          A lifetime of violence will do
          that.  My nose was broken four
          times.  And my jaw... But so much
          is the same.  The eyes, you
          recognize the eyes.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  The eyes have it.

                     SHINZON
          Our eyes reflect our lives, don't
          they?  Yours are so confident.

                     PICARD
          How did you end up on Remus?

                     SHINZON
          They sent me there to die.  How
          could a mere human survive the
          dilithium mines?  It was...
               (he can't find the words)
          ... I was a slave.  And a monster.
          The only thing the Romulan guards
          hated more than the Remans was me.
          But one man took pity on me: the
          man who became my Viceroy.  He
          taught me how to survive.  And in
          that dark place, where there was
          nothing of myself, I found my Reman
          brothers.  They showed me the only
          kindness I ever knew.

A beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.

                     SHINZON
          For thousands of years the Romulan
          Senate has met in this chamber and
          dictated the fate of its sister-
          planet... But the time has come for
          us to live as equals.

                     PICARD
          You're doing this to liberate the
          Remans?

                     SHINZON
          No race should be a slave to
          another.

Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.

                     SHINZON
          You don't trust me.

                     PICARD
          I have no reason to.

                     SHINZON
          Of course you do.  If you had lived
          my life and experienced the
          suffering of my people... you'd be
          sitting where I am now.  At least I
          hope you would.

                     PICARD
          And if you had lived my life you
          would understand that there is a
          great responsibility in
          representing the Federation.  I
          can't let my personal feelings
          unduly influence my decisions.

                     SHINZON
          All I have is my personal feelings.
          I wasn't raised with the ideals of
          the Federation.  But I'm trying to
          understand them now.  To live up to
          them   To live up to you.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          I want to know where I come from.
          The Remans gave me a future.  You
          can tell me about my past.

                     PICARD
          There's so much, and so much of it
          is dull...

                     SHINZON
          Were we always explorers?

                     PlCARD
          No.  I was the first Picard to
          leave Earth.  It caused quite a
          stir, In fact.  But I had spent my
          whole life...

                     SHINZON
               (finishing the sentence)
          Looking up at the stars.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you dreamed about what was up
          there.  About...

                     PICARD
               (finishing the sentence)
          New worlds.

A beat.

They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same
instant.  Stop.

                     PICARD
          After you, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          Age before rank, Jean Luc.

Picard smiles, pours a glass.

                     PICARD
          So I'm not as tall as you expected?

                     SHINZON
          I always hoped I would hit two
          meters.

                     PICARD
          With a full head of hair.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          There is that.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          Shinzon... I'm trying to believe
          you.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

                     PICARD
          If there's one ideal the Federation
          holds most dear it's that all men,
          all races, can be united.  From the
          first time the Vulcans came to
          Earth we've sought a future of
          peace.  Nothing would make me more
          proud than to take your hand in
          friendship.  In time.  When trust
          has been earned.

                     SHINZON
          I'm honored to think I might
          someday speak with such eloquence.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          In time, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          In time.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER

Picard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters.

                     VICEROY
          This is a mistake.

                     SHINZON
          He's gentler than I thought.  And
          he has a sense of humor.

                     VICEROY
               (stern)
          Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
          We should act.  Now.  Time is
          running out.

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          My time.  I'll spend it how I
          choose.

A tense beat.

                     SHINZON
          We'll return to the Scimitar.
          Prepare yourself for the bonding.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

                     WORF
          Sir, we've had an unauthorized
          access into the main computer.

                     PICARD
          Who was it?

                     GEORDI
          It's going to take some time to
          find out -- the data stream was
          rerouted through substations all
          over the ship.

                     PICARD
          What programs were accessed?

                     GEORDI
          That's what I don't get -- it's
          mostly basic stellar cartography:
          star charts; communications
          protocols; some uplinks from colony
          tracking stations.  It's not even
          restricted material.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          Set up a security program to detect
          any unusual data stream rerouting.
          If it happens again, we want to be
          ready.

                     GEORDI
               (grim)
          There's something else.  I was
          reviewing the sensor logs...
               (he refers to some
                readouts on his console)
          When the Scimitar decloaked there
          was a momentary spike in the
          tertiary EM band -- there -- You're
          not going to believe this but it's
          Thalaron.

Picard is shocked.

INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.

                     PICARD
          ... I thought Thalaron radiation
          was theoretical.

                     GEORDI
          Which is why our initial scans
          didn't pick it up.  But he's got
          it, Captain.

                     PICARD
          As I remember, Thalaron research
          was banned in the Federation
          because of its bioqenic properties.

                     BEVERLY
          It has the ability to consume
          organic material at the subatomic
          level.  I can't overestimate the
          danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean
          Luc.  A microscopic amount could
          kill every living thing on this
          ship in a matter of seconds.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to
          know what he has and how to
          neutralize any threat.  Give me
          options.

Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment.

                     DATA
          Doctor, will you excuse us for a
          moment?  Geordi, please come with
          me.

He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical
displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply
concerned.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo
album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply
troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face
before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon.

The door comm chirps.

                     PICARD
          Come...
               (Beverly enters)
          ... Beverly, come in.

                     BEVERLY
          You're working late.

She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Remember him?

                     BEVERLY
          He was a bit proud as I recall.

                     PICARD
          He was a damn fool.  Selfish and
          ambitious.  Very much in need of
          seasoning.

                     BEVERLY
          He turned out all right.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
          But the Thalaron radiation can't be
          explained away.  Whatever he's
          after, it's not peace.

                     BEVERLY
          Is he very much like you were?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

Data interrupts on comm:

                     DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and
          I have identified the source of the
          unauthorized computer access.  And,
          I believe, we have also discovered
          an opportunity to gain a tactical
          advantage.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          On my way...

                     BEVERLY
               (stands)
          Jean Luc -- whatever you were --
          right now you're the man you've
          made yourself.  He's someone else.

                     PICARD
          I wish I could believe that,
          Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Imzadi...

Shinzon stands across from her.

                     DEANNA
          You're not here.

                     SHINZON
               (moving to her)
          Very logical, Deanna... But your
          heart doesn't constrain itself to
          mere logic.
               (he caresses her)
          ... Your heart longs to discover
          me.  To know me...
               (he kisses her)
          ... To leave all of this behind and
          be with me.

He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost
violence.

                     DEANNA
          No...

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your desire, Deanna...

She forces herself to concentrate... to resist
telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is
hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing...
bending...

And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although
entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has
actually traveled.

She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes
she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.

On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna:

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your hunger to know the
          Reman ways... the old ways.

Then the world changes again...

Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her,
whispering:

                     SHINZON
          Don't fear what you desire...

She forces him away from her and --

She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with
emotion.

INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame.
Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head.

                     VICEROY
          The bond is broken.

                     SHINZON
          Find her again.

                     VICEROY
          No -- this is wasting time.

                     SHINZON
          Do as I tell you!

A Reman officer interrupts on comm:

                     REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
          Praetor, we've received the
          transponder signal.

                     SHINZON
               (to comm)
          On my way.

He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness
overtaking him.

The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange
moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's
chest.  His mind... probing.

Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.

                     VICEROY
          It's accelerating.  You have no
          more time for games.

                     SHINZON
          Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
          on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

                     SHINZON
          Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

                     SHINZON
          Welcome home.
               (to Engineers)
          Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

                     SHINZON
          Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

                     BEVERLY
          Aside from slightly elevated
          adrenalin and serotonin levels,
          you're completely normal.

                     PICARD
               (gently)
          Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

                     DEANNA
          It was... a violation.

Riker takes her hand.

                     DEANNA
               (with difficulty)
          Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the
          ability to reach into my thoughts.
          I've become a liability... I
          request to be relieved of my
          duties.

                     PICARD
          Permission denied.  If you can
          possibly endure any more of these
          assaults.  I need you at my side.
          Now more than ever I...

But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to
dematerialize!

                     RIKER
               (to comm)
          Worf!  Raise Shields !

But Picard is gone.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scimitar cloaks.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has
been removed.

Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus
is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV
tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work
over the mysterious chair.

Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the
other side of the force field.

Picard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now
visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate
spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.

                     SHINZON
          Hello, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Why am I here?

                     SHINZON
          I was lonely...
               (he realizes Picard is
                staring at the veins on
                his face)
          Perhaps I'm not aging as well as
          you did.

He nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field.
A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.

                     PICARD
               (resists)
          What are you doing?

                     SHINZON
          I need a sample of your blood.
          What do your Borg friends say?
          Resistance is futile.
               (maniacal laugh)

The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard
glances to the B-9.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.
          I learned there might be an
          existing prototype from a
          Cardassian historian, then went to
          a great deal of trouble to find it
          and scatter it about on Kolarus
          III.  I knew it would pique your
          curiosity and conveniently make the
          Enterprise the closest ship to
          Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

The Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is
reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical
apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As:

                     PICARD
          All of this so you could capture
          me?

                     SHINZON
          Don't be so vain.  After we found
          it, we made a few modifications.
          An extra memory port, a hidden
          transponder.  Perhaps your eyes
          will be a bit less confident when
          you learn I've gained access to
          Starfleet's communications
          protocols.  I now know the location
          of your entire fleet...
               (to B-9)
          ... You may go.

                     B-9
          Where?

                     SHINZON
          Out of my sight.

The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:

                     SHINZON
          Maybe I'll train it to do little
          tricks for me like your robot does.
          Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head
          off.

                     PICARD
          What's this all about?

                     SHINZON
          It's about destiny, Picard.  About
          a Reman outcast who --

                     PICARD
          You're not Reman.

                     SHINZON
          And I'm not quite human.  So what
          am I?  What do you see?
               (he peers at Picard
                deeply)
          Do you see a life you might have
          led?  Lost youth never to be
          recaptured?

                     PICARD
          I see a young man trying
          desperately to deny who he is.

                     SHINZON
          I see an old man, set in his ways,
          afraid to live without a uniform to
          prop him up and a Starfleet
          regulation to tell him what to do.
          I see the man I will never be.

                     PICARD
          I won't defend my life to you.

                     SHINZON
          My life is meaningless as long as
          you're alive.  What am I while you
          exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

                     PICARD
               (stern)
          If your issues are with me... This
          has nothing to do with my ship and
          nothing to do with the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          Oh, but it does.  We will no longer
          bow like slaves before anyone.  Not
          the Romulans and not your mighty
          Federation.  We're a race bred for
          war.  For conquest.

                     PICARD
          Think about what you're doing,
          Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge
          the entire quadrant into war to
          satisfy your own personal demons?

                     SHINZON
          It amazes me how little you know
          yourself.

                     PICARD
          I'm incapable of such an act, and
          so are you.

                     SHINZON
          I think the facts speak for
          themselves.  The same noble Picard
          blood runs in our veins.  Had you
          lived my life, you'd be doing
          exactly as I am.  Look in the
          mirror, and see yourself.

Shinzon looks at him deeply.

                     SHINZON
          Consider that, Captain.  I can
          think of no greater torment for
          you.

He turns to go.

                     PICARD
          It's a mirror for you as well...

Shinzon turns back to him.

A beat.  Picard gazes at him evenly.

Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.  He glances
to the ghoulish medical preparations.

                     SHINZON
          Not for long, Captain.
               (back to Picard)
          I'm afraid you won't survive to
          witness the victory of the echo
          over the voice.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The ship is on Red Alert.  Worf stands at tactical, muscles
coiled, hungry for action.

                     WORF
          No response to our hails.

Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.  Riker stands
over him:

                     GEORDI
               (frustrated)
          His cloak is perfect... no tachyon
          emissions, no residual antiprotons.

                     RIKER
          Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.  She carries a medical
padd.

                     BEVERLY
          Will, I need to talk to you.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the
security force field, trying to spot any weakness.

Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor
weapon.

                     B-9
               (to Reman guard)
          I am to take the prisoner to the
          Praetor.

The Reman Guard deactivates the force field.

                     B-9
          If you resist, I will incapacitate
          you.

He leads Picard out.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The B-9 leads Picard through the dark corridors, holding the
disruptor on him steadily.  All the Remans they pass glare at
Picard with undisguised loathing.

The Viceroy approaches.  Stops before them.

                     VICEROY
               (to B-9)
          Where are you taking him?

                     B-9
          Praetor Shinzon wants him on the
          bridge.

The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.

                     VICEROY
          So, human... you've met your better
          self!

                     PICARD
          What are you doing to Counsellor
          Troi?

                     VICEROY
          I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To
          sooth him as she soothes you.  To
          stand at his side as she does at
          yours.

                     PICARD
          That will never happen.

                     VICEROY
          Listen to him, android.  Such a
          small and weak creature.  Yet he
          roars so valiantly...
               (he raises one taloned
                claw and puts a sharp
                fingernail on Picard's
                chest)
          It would take me but an instant to
          tear that valiant heart from your
          chest.

                     PICARD
          There'll be another after me.  And
          another after that.  You'll find
          we're a resilient species.

                     VICEROY
          I look forward to the sport.
               (to the B-9, harshly)
          Take him.

The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
Picard grimaces in pain

                     B-9
          Move.

The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads
Picard along.

                     PICARD
               (whispers)
          Be careful of over-playing your
          part, Commander!

And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the
B-9 and rejoices.

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a
          touch of reality to the
          performance.

They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then:

                     DATA
          My mission was a success, sir.  I
          have discovered the source of the
          Thalaron radiation.

                     PICARD
          Good work.  The download?

                     DATA
          He believes he has our
          communications protocols.  But they
          will give him inaccurate locations
          for all Starfleet vessels.

Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some
Reman Warriors.

                     DATA
          Move, puny human animal.

They pass the Warriors.

                     PICARD
          A bit less florid, Data.

                     DATA
          Aye, sir... This way.

He leads Picard down the corridor.

INT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a
cathedral.  It is the size of a small town.

The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.

                     DATA
          This entire ship is, essentially, a
          flying Thalaron generator.
               (he points up)
          All its power relays lead to that
          device.

High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a
gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the
Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking.

                     PICARD
          A weapon.

                     DATA
          It would appear so.

Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward,
exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a
small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation
technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.)

                     DATA
          Geordi equipped me with the
          prototype for the Emergency
          Transport Unit.  I recommend you
          use it to return to the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          It'll only work for one of us.

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.

                     PICARD
          We'll find a way off together.
          Recommendations?

                     DATA
          There is a shuttlebay 948 meters
          from our current location.

Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the
chamber.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops.

                     VICEROY
          Where's Picard?

Shinzon looks at him, confused.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman
commands are broadcast through the corridors.

                     DATA
          This way, sir!

They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman
warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the
disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --

A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-
to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.

More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a
disruptor.

And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle
breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions
illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.

They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the
shuttlebay door -- it does not open.

                     DATA
               (looking at door security
                panel)
          It seems to have an encrypted
          security system.

Reman warriors are closing in on them.

Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and
instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire
down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff --
keeping the Remans at bay --

As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay
door security panel at an amazing rate --

                     PICARD
          Alacrity would be appreciated,
          Commander.

                     DATA
          They are trying to override the
          access codes.  Reman is really a
          most complex language with
          pictographs representing certain
          verb roots and --

                     PICARD
          While I find that fascinating,
          Data, we really need that Goddamned
          door open!

The shuttlebay door slides open.

Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and
Data duck into the shuttlebay.

INT.  SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a
disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.

They turn to face...

A fleet of very small shuttles.  They are uniquely designed.
Extremely compact and stream-lined.  A disruptor turret on
each.

They move toward one as:

                     DATA
          According to the ship's manifest
          they are Scorpion-class attack
          fliers.

They quickly climb a Scorpion.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.  Picard climbs into
the pilot's position.  Data assumes the gunner's position.

They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to
the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:

                     PICARD
               (trying to figure out the
                controls)
          What do you imagine this is?

                     DATA
          Port thrusters, sir.  Would you
          like me to drive?

Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.  The
Scorpion lifts off.  Hovers a few feet over the deck.  Picard
elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay
external doors as:

                     PICARD
          Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.
          They have instigated security
          overrides and erected a force field
          around the external portals.

                     PICARD
          Well then... only one way to go.

He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors
they came through, the doors back into the ship.

Data is dubious.

                     DATA
          Do you think this is a wise course
          of action?

                     PICARD
          We're about to find out... Power up
          disruptors and fire on my mark.

                     DATA
          Ready, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!  The doors into
the ship explode!  Picard powers forward!

INT.  SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned
Remans.  Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of
the corridor but keeps control.

The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING

Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to
control the world's fastest roller coaster.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through
the ship at breakneck speed --

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.

The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --

A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top
of the room --

And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through
the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Worf!  Lock on transporters!

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.

                     SHINZON
          Tractor beam!  Now!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
Picard and Data climb out --

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Number One, emergency warp!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING

The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling
over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to...

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through
space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan
collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now.

                     SHINZON
          The Enterprise is immaterial!  They
          won't make it back to Federation
          space.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (angry)
          This has gone far enough!

                     SHINZON
          I thought we discussed patience,
          Commander.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          And mine is wearing thin, young
          man!  We supported you because you
          promised action.  And yet you delay
          and you waste your time playing
          games with Picard while --

Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic 
exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Suran, the games are
          over.  In two days the Federation
          will be crippled beyond repair.
          Does that satisfy you?

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (grim)
          For the moment.

                     SHINZON
               (brutal)
          And when I return... you and I
          shall have a little talk about
          showing proper respect!

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING

The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit
for a silent beat.

                     DONATRA
          Does anyone in this room harbor any
          illusions about what he means by
          "showing proper respect"?

                     TAL'AURA
          What's happening to his face?

                     SURAN
          I want opinions.  He is clearly out
          of his mind.

                     SURAN
          But can he complete his mission?

                     DONATRA
          Should he?

They look at her.

                     DONATRA
          Are you prepared to have your hands
          drenched in blood?  He'll show them
          no mercy.  And his sins will mark
          us all for generations.  Is that
          what you truly want, Romulans?

A beat.

                     DONATRA
          I think you should consider that
          question now -- or else you may
          have a lifetime to think about it
          in the dilithium mines.

She turns and stalks out.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.

                     BEVERLY
          The more I studied his DNA the more
          confusing it got.  Finally I could
          only come to one conclusion...
          Shinzon was created with temporal
          RNA sequencing.  He was designed so
          that at a certain point his aging
          process could be accelerated to
          reach your age more quickly, so he
          could replace you.

                     PICARD
          But the Romulans abandoned the
          plan...

                     BEVERLY
          As a result the temporal sequencing
          was never activated.  Remember, he
          was supposed to replace you at
          nearly your current age.  He was
          engineered to skip thirty years of
          life.  But since the RNA sequencing
          was never activated, his cellular
          structure has started to break
          down.  He's dying.

                     PICARD
          Dying?

                     RIKER
          He wasn't designed to live a
          complete, human life span.

                     PlCARD
          Can anything be done for him?

                     BEVERLY
          Not without a complete
          myelodysplastic infusion from the
          only donor with compatible DNA.
          But that would mean draining all
          your blood.

                     RIKER
          That's why he went to all that
          trouble to capture you.

                     PlCARD
          How long does he have?

                     BEVERLY
          I can't be sure but the rate of
          decay seems to be accelerating.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
          Then he'll come for me as a donor.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Data stands before the B-9.

The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and
immobile.  Data gazes deeply into his double's identical
features.  Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a
small instrument to activate the android's head.

The B-9's eyes spring to life.  He looks at Data.

                     B-9
          Brother.  I cannot move.

                     DATA
          No, I have only activated your
          cognitive and communication
          subroutines.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because you are dangerous.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          You have been programmed to gather
          information that can be used
          against this ship.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     DATA
          I know.

A beat.

                     DATA
          Do you know anything about
          Shinzon's plans against the
          Federation?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Do you have any knowledge of the
          tactical abilities of his ship?

                     B-9
          No.  Can I move now?

                     DATA
          No.  I must deactivate you.

                     B-9
          For how long?

                     DATA
          Indefinitely.

                     B-9
          How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

                     DATA
          A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

                     GEORDI
          It's called a Cascading Biogenic
          Pulse.  The unique properties of
          Thalaron radiation allow the energy
          beam to expand almost without
          limits.  Depending on the radiant
          intensity it could encompass a
          ship... or a planet.

                     PICARD
               (thinking)
          And that's exactly what he's going
          to do.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          His hatred of the Federation is
          apparent.  He would have built a
          weapon of that scope for one
          reason.  He is going after Earth.

                     RIKER
          Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the
          Federation is crippled...

                     PICARD
          And the Romulans invade.

                     DEANNA
          How can you be certain?

                     PICARD
          I know how he thinks.

A beat.

                     RIKER
               (to Geordi)
          And there's no way to penetrate his
          cloak?

                     GEORDI
          No, sir.

                     RIKER
               (frustrated)
          He could pass within 10 meters of
          every ship in Starfleet and they'd
          never know.

                     BEVERLY
          But we do have one advantage.
               (to Picard)
          He needs your blood to live.  He
          might come after you first.

                     PICARD
          I'm counting on it... We've been
          ordered to head to sector 3274.
          Starfleet is diverting the fleet to
          meet us there.

                     RIKER
          Strength in numbers?

                     PICARD
          We can only hope so.

A beat as he looks at them gravely.

                     PICARD
          He can't be allowed to use that
          weapon.  All other concerns are
          secondary.  Do you understand me?

Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is
expendable.

                     RIKER
          Yes, sir.

Picard stands.  Presses a comm button.

                     PICARD
          All hands.  Battle stations.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES

We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle.

Crew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring
open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser
rifles.

Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field
around the warp core.

Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans...

Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on
Shinzon's ship.

Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with
apprehensive young ensign.

As we hear:

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Personal Log.
          Supplemental.  We're heading toward
          Federation space at maximum warp.
          The crew has responded with the
          dedication I've come to expect of
          them.  And like a thousand other
          commanders on a thousand other
          battlefields throughout history, I
          wait for the dawn.

The montage ends as...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard enters sickbay.

Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They
position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies.
Security officers are handing out phasers.

Picard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him,
bolstering her phaser.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          To seek out new life and new
          civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's
          own words.  When Charles Darwin set
          out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his
          journey into the unknown... he
          sailed without a single musket.

                     BEVERLY
               (gently)
          That was another time.

                     PICARD
          How far we've come.  Let me know if
          you need anything.

He starts to go --

                     BEVERLY
          Jean Luc...
               (he stops)
          ... He is not you.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          What makes us who we are, Doctor?
          Can you tell me that?

She watches him go.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

                     SHINZON
          How long?

                     VICEROY
          A matter of hours now --

Shinzon shoves him away.  Stands.

                     VICEROY
          If you don't begin the procedure
          soon you'll never make it back to
          Romulus.  You shouldn't have
          delayed.  You should have killed
          Picard the moment --

Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.  The Viceroy watches
him carefully.

A beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.  He sits again in his
command chair.

                     SHINZON
          How long until we reach the Rift?

                     VICEROY
               (checks a console)
          Seven minutes.

Shinzon leans back, satisfied.  And looks at the viewscreen.

The image on the viewscreen is shocking.

The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise zooms through space.

Completely unaware of the predator directly above it.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ASTROMETRICS - NIGHT

Data is at work in Astrometry.  Cartographic projections of
star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard enters.

                     PICARD
          Show me our current position.

The images before them quickly change to show another sector
and a blip representing the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          How long until we reach the fleet?

                     DATA
          At our current velocity we will
          arrive at sector 3274 in
          approximately 40 minutes.

The images before them change to show sector 3274.  We see
blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a
moment.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          "For now we see but through a glass
          darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

                     DATA
          Of you?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     DATA
          I do not agree.  Although you share
          the same genetic structure, the
          events of your life have created
          unique individual.

                     PICARD
          But so much is the same.  On a
          biological level he is... and I
          will not accept the idea that there
          is nothing I can do.  I have a
          responsibility to try to make a
          human connection with him.

                     DATA
          He would deny a "human" connection
          is possible.  He considers himself
          entirely Reman.

                     PICARD
          He may have already rejected my
          humanity, but you also have a twin.

                     DATA
          No, sir, it is not possible.  The
          B-9 is physically identical to me,
          although his neural pathways are
          not as advanced.  But even if they
          were, he would not be me.

                     PICARD
          How can you be sure?

                     DATA
          I aspire, sir.  To be better than I
          am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does
          Shinzon.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We'll never know what Shinzon might
          have been.  Had he stood where I
          did as a child?  And looked up at
          the stars.

Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.

Then the projections before them sputter with static for a
moment.  Flickering.

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          We are passing through the Bassen
          Rift.  The projections will return
          when we have cleared it.

                     PICARD
          It's interfering with our uplink
          from Starfleet cartography?

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all
          long-range communications --

                     PICARD
                (urgent, to comm)
          Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Too late.

The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise
is under attack!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through
space -- slamming into the Enterprise's warp drive.  The
Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a
furious lurch.

The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic
distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the
Enterprise before him.

                     SHINZON
          Target weapons systems and shields.
          I don't want the Enterprise
          destroyed.

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the
Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise.

                     SHINZON
          Can you learn to see in the dark,
          Captain?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship
ROCKS --

                     PICARD
          Report.

                     RIKER
          He's firing through his cloak.  We
          can't get a lock.

                     GEORDI
               (at engineering station)
          He disabled our warp drive with his
          first shot.  We've only got
          impulse.

                     WORF
          Long range communication is
          impossible as long as we're in the
          rift --

The ship SHUDDERS again --

                     PICARD
          Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,
          zero elevation.  All banks on my
          mark.  Scan for shield impacts and
          stand by photon torpedoes.

                     WORF
          Aye, sir

The ship ROCKS again.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy
beams shoot into space --

And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of
its shields is hit.

Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but
pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields
were momentarily illuminated.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          You're too slow, old man.
               (entering commands in his
                chair console)
          Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the
Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a
brutal, close range assault --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--

                     DATA
          We are losing dorsal shields --

                     PICARD
          Full axis rotation to port!  Fire
          all ventral phasers!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over
to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship
streaks above it --

A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise --
now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the
bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

INT.  ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     WORF
          Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

          Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
          Geordi, get those shields online.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Counselor Troi, report to the
          bridge.

                     RIKER
          Unless we can disable his cloak
          we're just going to be firing in
          the dark.

                     PlCARD
          Agreed.

                     WORF
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

Shinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of
the Scimitar.

                     SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, will you join me in
          your Ready Room?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

Picard stands in his Ready Room.  A flickering light shimmers
across the room.  And a perfect holographic representation of
Shinzon appears before him.

                     SHINZON
          You can't trace my holographic
          emitters, Captain.  So don't
          bother.  And you can't contact
          Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

                     PICARD
          We are.

                     SHINZON
          It's just the two of us now, Jean
          Luc, as it should be... Your ship
          and mine... You and me.

                     PICARD
          Why are you here?

                     SHINZON
          To accept your surrender.  I can
          clearly destroy you at any time.
          Lower your shields and allow me to
          transport you to my ship.

                     PICARD
          And what of the Enterprise?

                     SHINZON
          I have little interest in your
          quaint vessel, Captain.  If the
          Enterprise will withdraw to a
          distance of one hundred light
          years, it will not be harmed.

                     PICARD
          You know that's not possible.

                     SHINZON
          I know... you'll all gladly die to
          save your home world.

                     PICARD
               (intense)
          Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel
          the blood pumping inside you?  Your
          hands, your eyes, your nature, are
          the same as mine.  Buried deep
          inside you beneath the years of
          pain and anger is a capacity you've
          forgotten.  It's the one way our
          mirror can reflect the two of us
          exactly because it's the very thing
          that truly defines us.  To be human
          is to try to make yourself better
          than you are.

Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.

                     PICARD
          I know you as well as I know
          myself, Shinzon.  There was a time
          you looked at the stars and dreamed
          of what might be.

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          Long ago.

                     PICARD
          Not so long.

                     SHINZON
          Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in
          the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm
          what you see now.

                     PICARD
          I see more than what you are.

Picard steps toward him.

                     PICARD
          I see what you could be.

Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward
him relentlessly.

                     PICARD
          The man who is Jean Luc Picard and
          Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate
          the population of an entire planet!
          He is better than that!

                     SHINZON
               (desperate)
          He is what his life has made him!

Shinzon is in turmoil.  Picard senses this.  He proceeds
quietly:

                     PICARD
          And what will he do with that life?

Shinzon looks at him, questioning.

                     PICARD
          If I were to beam to your ship...
          let you complete your medical
          procedure, give you a full life...
          what would you do with the time?

Shinzon doesn't respond.

                     PICARD
          You once asked me about your past.
          Your history.  When I was your age,
          I burned with ambition.  I was very
          proud and my pride often hurt
          people.  I made every wrong choice
          a young man can... But one thing
          saved me... I had a father who
          believed in me.  Who took the time
          to teach me a better way.  You have
          the same father.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.

                     PICARD
          So if I gave you my life, what
          would you do with it?  Would you
          spend the years in a blaze of
          hatred as you are now?  Or could
          you change?  Could you try to
          remember a mother's touch you never
          felt?  A father's words you never
          heard?  Could you do that?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I don't know.

                     PICARD
          But you want to.

Shinzon doesn't respond.  But Picard knows he has made a
connection.  For this brief moment reconciliation is
possible.  He proceeds quietly:

                     PICARD
          Let me tell you about our father.

Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.  What might have
been.

                     SHINZON
          That's your life... not mine.

                     PICARD
          Please.

                     SHINZON
          It's too late.

                     PICARD
          You can still make a choice!  Make
          the right one now!

                     SHINZON
          I have no choices!  I can't fight
          what I am!

Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:

                     SHINZON
          I'll show you my true nature.  Your
          nature.  And as Earth dies --
          remember that I'm forever Shinzon
          of Remus!  And my voice will echo
          through time long after yours has
          faded to a dim memory.

Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image
flickers and fades away.

Picard stands alone, drained.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his
Viceroy:

                     SHINZON
          Disable their weapons!

But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS
-- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned.

                     SHINZON
          Report!

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Two ships decloaking, sir!
          Romulan!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds
appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge.

                     RIKER
          Believe it or not, I think the
          cavalry has arrived.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
          of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we
          be of assistance?

                     PICARD
          Your timing is impeccable,
          Commander.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          The Empire considers this a matter
          of internal security.  We regret
          you've become involved.

                     PICARD
          When this is over, I owe you a
          drink.

On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to
          work.  Valdore out.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          You heard the lady.  Get to work.
          Move your ass!

(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons
and are visible throughout the battle.)

Although Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage
of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise
and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with
impacts.

Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair.

                     SHINZON
          Target the flanking Warbird.  All
          forward disruptor banks on my mark.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two
Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's
shields.

The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position,
firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded
as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor
beams criss-cross space.

Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her
forward disruptor banks fire at once --

They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge
EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY
off the Enterprise's forward shields -- !

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The ship ROCKS dangerously!

                     DATA
          Forward shields are down to ten
          percent.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm)
          Bring us about!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers,
as the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon's ship, firing --

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the
          aft port quadrant and prepare for
          full emergency stop.

                     VICEROY
               (startled)
          What?!

                     SHINZON
          You heard me.

INT.  VALDORE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at
viewscreen.  She sees part of the Scimitar's rear cloakning
fall away --

                     DONATRA
          She's losing her cloak!  Stand by
          all forward disruptor banks!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     VICEROY
          She's almost on us.

                     SHINZON
          Not yet.

On the viewscreen  we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining.
The Reman crew is getting nervous.

                     VICEROY
          Praetor...

                     SHINZON
          FULL STOP AND FIRE !

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop!  Too fast for the Valdore to
respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar --

And the Scimitar fires!

A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the
underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past --

The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
It floats dead in space.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Restore the aft cloak.and bring us
          about.

He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final
battle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on
viewscreen.  Her bridge is in ruins.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I'm afraid that drink will have to
          wait, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Do you have life support?

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          For the moment.  But we're dead in
          the water.

                     PICARD
          Understood --

Then the ship ROCKS --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal
assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's
hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the Enterprise --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     DATA
          We have lost structural integrity
          on decks twelve through seventeen,
          sections four through ten.

                     GEORDI
          Emergency force fields are holding.

                     RIKER
          Evacuate those decks and reroute
          field power to forward shields.

Deanna goes to Picard:

                     DEANNA
          Captain -- I might have a way to
          find them.

                     PICARD
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          The one thing he may have forgotten
          in the course of battle: me.

                     PICARD
          Make it so.

She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console.

                     SHINZON
          Prepare a lateral run -- all
          starboard disruptors.

Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes --

                     VICEROY
          No!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with
Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo
targeting display.

It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts.

                     DEANNA
          He's resisting me.

She is in pain.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing
thoughts.

                     SHINZON
          What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

                     VICEROY
          She is here.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting
display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating
fiercely.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle.
Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him.

                     DEANNA
          Remember me?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Her eyes snap open --

                     DEANNA
          NOW!

Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space.

And connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the
Scimitar's cloak fails!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands quickly.

                     PICARD
          Savage them!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

And the Enterprise attacks!

It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon
torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds
quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the
darkness and debris litters the deck.

Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation.

                     SHINZON
               (spinning to his Viceroy)
          Prepare a boarding party -- BRING
          ME PICARD!

The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer.

                     SHINZON
          Get the cloak back!  And target
          shield coordinates beta three.  All
          disruptors.  Fire!

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny
part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                     DATA
          Captain, we have lost ventral
          shielding on deck twenty nine.

                     PICARD
          Divert power and compensate --

An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge.

                     WORF
          Intruder alert!

                     RIKER
          Let's go.

Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as:

                     WORF
               (to comm)
          Security detail to deck twenty
          nine.

Data immediately assumes Worf's position at tactical.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - LOWER DECKS - NIGHT

Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the
cramped lower decks.

A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold!  The Viceroy and
his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the
corridor!

The Enterprise crew returns fire.  It is a blazing phaser
battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage.  They
steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor
fire --

They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy
escape into a Jefferies tube --

                     RIKER
          Worf.

Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and
sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady
burst from his phaser rifle.

Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him
into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man
who has been tormenting his wife --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling
the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon
torpedoes.

A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward
bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO
SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position --

Deanna races to assume the helm --

Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole
in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for
another attack run as part of the ship disappears --

                     GEORDI
          He's getting his cloak back.  We
          have exhausted our compliment of
          photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are
          down to four percent.

                     PICARD
          What if we target all phasers in a
          concentrated attack?

                     DATA
          The Scimitar's shields are still at
          seventy percent.  It would make no
          difference, sir.

Picard thinks.

                     DEANNA
          They're stopping...

Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly
turning.  Slowly advancing.  They see another part of the
Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning.

                     GEORDI
          What's he doing?

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          He wants to look me in the eye.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBE - FOLLOWING

Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine
series of access tunnels.  It is like a scene from ALIEN.

The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the
crippled ship make this an ominous sequence.  The Viceroy is
in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman
Homeworld, he can see in the dark.

Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
He stops, phaser ready.  He peers into the dark tunnel ahead
of him.  Sees nothing.  We tilt up and see...

The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker!
Hidden in the darkness.  The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down
on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the
darkness --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into
position.  Large parts of it are now cloaked.

It stops.  Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its
great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the
bridge.

Picard thinks, his mind racing.  Then it comes to him in a
flash:

                     PICARD
          He thinks he knows exactly what I'm
          going to do...

                     GEORDI
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          We've got him!

He sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering
command instructions in his chair console.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command
chair.

                     SHINZON
          Open a channel.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard is still entering commands in his chair console.

                     DATA
          We are being hailed.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, stand by.
               (to Data)
          Open a channel.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you're still alive, Jean
          Luc.

                     PICARD
          I am.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Don't you think it's time to
          surrender?  I'll have my cloak back
          in a matter of minutes and your
          poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why
          should the rest of your crew have
          to die?

Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to
Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of
this as Picard buys some time:

                     PICARD
          I never told you about my first
          Academy evaluation, did I?  I
          received very high marks for my
          studies.  But I was found lacking
          in certain other areas.
          Personality traits, you might say.
          In particular I was thought to be
          extremely...
               (he glares up at the prow
                of the Scimitar)
          ... over-confident.

Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then:

                     PICARD
               (quickly)
          Geordi, put 211 power to the
          engines.  Take it from life support
          if you have to -- everything you
          can give me.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, on my mark.

                     GEORDI
          Ready, sir!

Picard leans forward in his chair:

                     PICARD
               (on comm)
          All hands, brace for impact!
               (to Deanna)
          ENGAGE.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- !

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up --

                     SHINZON
          HARD TO PORT !

Too late.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar
-- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship --

The Scimitar REELS --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Everyone goes FLYING!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating
in space.

The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in
Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his
bridge crew are now dead.

                     SHINZON
          Divert all power to engines.  Full
          reverse!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the
Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a
deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar
is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING

The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear
itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the
collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the
relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs --

Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is
momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both
tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall!

Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy,
grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a
long drop below them!

Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a
brutal struggle --

Riker glares at him.

                     RIKER
          Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

                     PICARD
          Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

                     PICARD
          Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
          Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize
          voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.
          Authorization Alpha Alpha Three
          Zero Five --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

                     SHINZON
          Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

                     SHINZON
          Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
          on that ship.  Then set a course
          for Earth.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          What about Picard?

                     SHINZON
          Our greater goal is more important,
          brother.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          But, Praetor, you won't survive
          without him...

Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen.

                     SHINZON
          Some ideals are worth dying for,
          aren't they, Jean Luc?

EXT.  RIFT - SPACE

The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic
version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan
Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
The Cascading Pulse.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse
weapon slowly deploying.

                     PICARD
          How long until he can fire?

                     GEORDI
          The targeting sequence should take
          about four minutes.

                     DEANNA
          But how can he?  He'll kill you.

                     PICARD
          This isn't about me anymore.

Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do.
Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as...

                     PICARD
          Prepare for a site-to-site
          transport.

                     GEORDI
               (concerned)
          Sir, we won't be able to bring you
          back.  It's a one way trip.
          Captain, I don't know if the
          transporter --

                     PICARD
          That's an order, Commander.

                     DATA
          Sir, allow me to go.  You are
          needed here.

                     PICARD
          Negative.

                     DATA
          Sir...

Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is
something Picard must do himself.

                     DEANNA
          Let him go.

Picard powers up the phaser rifle as:

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          You have the bridge, Commander.
          Use all available power to move
          away from the Scimitar.
               (to Geordi)
          Now, Mister La Forge.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and
Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes
in a shower of sparks.

                     GEORDI
          That's it.  Transporters are down.

Data thinks for a moment.  Then:

                     DATA
          Counsellor Troi, please assume
          command.  Geordi, if you will come
          with me.

He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker
returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his
phaser rifle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the
corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in
place at the end of the corridor.

Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers
on around him.

Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.

                     DATA
          What is our approximate distance?

                     GEORDI
               (scans with tricorder)
          400 meters.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

Data backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again.
Deeply.

                     DATA
          Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the
          field.

Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end
of the corridor snaps off --

The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running
start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

-- into space.

He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him.
Carrying him too far!

He is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He
thrusts out a hand --

And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is
floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS
into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship!

He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls
himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with
his superior strength and climbs inside.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the
viewscreen.

We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is
locked on the Enterprise.

Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the
three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through
the floor.

                     COMPUTER (V.O)
          Forty-seven.  Forty six...

Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge
explode in.  Shinzon spins to see --

Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.

Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but
Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in
the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned.

The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing
disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with
his phaser rifle --

He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor
blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins
away --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor
from a fallen comrade --

As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long
metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear --

Impaling Shinzon.

A stunned moment of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard,
almost with a look of disbelief.  Blood spews from his mouth
as he lets out a tormented cry.

And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward --
pushing Picard back against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks
toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear
-- the spear point explodes through Shinzon's back -- the
weight of Shinzon's body is pinning Picard against the wall
-- time is running out --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Eighteen... Seventeen...

Shinzon forces himself down the spear:

                     SHINZON
          I'm glad we're together now -- our
          destiny is complete.

He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps
his dying hands firmly around Picard's throat --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Ten...Nine...

Data sprints to the bridge --

He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small,
silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --
he slaps it on Picard's shoulder.  A final look between
them --
                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Seven..  Six...

Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes.

Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply:

                     DATA
          Goodbye.

Then he spins and pulls out his phaser --

And fires point-blank into the Scimitar's warp core relays --
the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard re-materializes.

He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the
gaping hole in the front of the bridge.

Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.  Geordi stands
on the upper rear deck, head down.

A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the
thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes.

Riker emerges from the turbolift.  Goes to Picard.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

Picard doesn't answer, he just stares forward.  Deanna goes
to Riker.

                     DEANNA
          Data.

Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance.
He puts an arm around Deanna.

Silence.

                     GEORDI
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen...
               (he remembers there is no
                longer a viewscreen)
          ... Open a channel.

                     DONATRA (V.O.)
          This is Commander Donatra of the
          Valdore.  We're dispatching
          shuttles with medical personnel and
          supplies.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Commander.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (flat)
          Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
          for arrivals.  They don't know our
          procedures so just... open the
          doors.

                     GEORDI
          I'll take care of it, sir.

                     PICARD
          Number One.
               (a beat)
          You have the bridge.

He turns and heads toward his Ready Room.

The others watch him go with great sadness.

When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally
allows herself to cry.  Riker holds her closely.  Slow fade
to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Hours later.  The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the
shattered remains of the crew lounge.  Picard, Riker, Deanna,
Beverly, Worf, Geordi.

They wear their dress uniforms.

Picard goes to each of them.  He carries a small, metal box.
They each take something from the box.

At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we
realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their
uniforms.

Mourning bands.

Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard.
Each takes a glass.

Picard raises his glass.

                     PICARD
          To absent friends... o family.

They toast Data.  Slow fade to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do
not see.

                     PICARD
          I don't know if all this has made
          sense to you, but I wanted you to
          know what kind of man he was.  In
          his quest to be more like us, he
          helped show us what it means to be
          human.

We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from
him.

                     B-9
          My brother was not a human.

                     PICARD
          No, he wasn't... But his wonder and
          his curiosity about every facet of
          human life helped all of us see the
          best parts of ourselves.  He
          embraced change... because he
          always wanted to be more than he
          was.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     PICARD
          Well, I hope someday you will.

Worf interrupts on comm:

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, the Hemingway has arrived
          to tow us to spacedock.

                     PICARD
          On my way.  Please notify Commander
          Riker...
               (he stands, prepares to
                go)
          ... We'll talk later?

The B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at
the padd on Picard's desk.

Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He
turns back to the B-9.

The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's
humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very
softly...

                     B-9
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see."

Then the B-9 is silent.

Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over
his features, and then goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way
past the debris littering the corridor.

                     PICARD
          I'm sorry you won't be here for the
          re-fit, but I know the Titan needs
          you immediately.

Riker does not respond.

Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply.

                     PICARD
          The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And
          she's getting a captain worthy of
          her.

                     RIKER
          She's the most beautiful ship I've
          ever seen.
               (he touches a wall of the
                corridor)
          ... But she's not the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          I promise you in time, she'll
          become your home... If I could
          offer you one piece of advice?

                     RIKER
          Anything.

                     PICARD
          When your first officer insists
          that you can't go on away
          missions... Ignore him --

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          I intend to.

A moment.

                     RIKER
               (with difficulty)
          Serving with you has been an honor.

                     PICARD
          The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH

A few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great
womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces
nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself
before entering.

Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around
the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young
officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering
station.  We also see new command chairs being installed.

(Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at
the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.)

A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at
Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in
amusement.  He sees her.

                     MADDEN
          So... what's the old man like?

                     OPS OFFICER
          Why don't you go in and find out?

Commander Madden prepares himself.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING

Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her
new office at Starfleet Medical.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.
          They're kids!  All with advance
          degrees in xenobiology and out to
          conquer every disease in the
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Reminds me of a young doctor I used
          to know...

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          They're running me ragged.  Nothing
          but questions day and night... I
          love it!  Come to dinner and I'll
          tell you all about it.  There's a
          Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

                     PICARD
          Not tonight, I have work here.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Soon then.  I'll save the last
          dance for you.

Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door
chime so Picard is surprised.

                     MADDEN
          Commander Martin Madden reporting
          for duty, sir.

Picard stands, they shake hands as:

                     PICARD
          Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,
          your transfer didn't come as too
          much of a surprise.

                     MADDEN
          I was... honored, sir.

                     PICARD
          I needed you immediately to help
          oversee the re-fit...
               (gathering up some padds
                from his desk)
          ... Your service record on the
          Talos is exemplary, but there are a
          few things I would like to discuss
          with you regarding my requirements
          for a First Officer.  Shall we say
          dinner in my quarters at 1900
          hours?

                     MADDEN
          Very good, sir.

Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.

                     PICARD
          Commander, I don't know how they
          did it on the Talos, but we have
          door chimes on the Enterprise.  We
          use them.

                     MADDEN
          Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky
young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command
chair.

                     WORF
          You don't understand the Captain --
          there should be no changes until we
          have discussed the modifications
          with him.

Picard goes to them:

                     PICARD
          What's this?

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          Your new chair, sir.

                     ENSIGN
          It's the Mark Seven, Captain.
          State-of-the-art ergonomics...
          command interfaces with --

                     WORF
          I told him you're comfortable with
          your old chair.

                     PICARD
          Let's give it a try.

He settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a
beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new
generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles.

                     PICARD
          Feels good.

Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.

                     ENSIGN
               (points)
          Try that button, sir.

Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal
restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders.
Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised.

A beat.

Then Picard smiles.

                     PICARD
          It's about time.

He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into
the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden:

                     PICARD
          Commander, please sit down...

Madden sits in the First Officer's chair, Picard shares a
padd with him.

                     PICARD
          ... We've received our first
          assignment.  We're going to be
          exploring the Denab system.  It
          should be exciting.  It's a
          place... where no one has gone
          before.

And we cut to --

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH - FOLLOWING

Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden.
Picard at work, at peace.  Where he is meant to be.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.  As we
hear the B-9's soft tones.  Gentle.  Hopeful.

                     B-9 (V.O.)
          "Never saw the sun shining so
          bright, Never saw things going so
          right.  Noticing the days hurrying
          by, When you're in love, my how
          they fly.  Blue days, all of them
          gone, Nothing but blue skies from
          now on."

We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the
stars.  Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing
"Next Generation" theme explodes over END CREDITS.

                                                FADE OUT.

                          John Logan

































FADE IN:

INT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY

Life.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse
finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.

CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying
and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy
of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures
lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.

We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.

The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

EXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT

Labor...

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.

The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.

Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
CREDITS end as we go to...

EXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET

The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan
Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of
this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the
horizon.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET

SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s.

                     SENATOR 1
          ... but if we hesitate we'll lose
          this important source of dilithium.
          A trade agreement is in the best
          interests of the Empire.

                     SENATOR 2
          Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a
          diplomatic mission to Celes II to
          open negotiations.

Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
Praetor Hiren glances to her.

                     PRAETOR
          Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
          the motion.

                     TAL'AURA
          No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"
          is to be advised.  I support all
          "diplomatic" overtures.  But if you
          will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
          appointment with the Tholian
          ambassador.

The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...

                     PRAETOR
          Then I will call for a vote on the
          motion to open trade negotiations
          with Celes II...

The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.

The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then "legs" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.

Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.

And then just as suddenly the light disappears.

A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.

                     PRAETOR
          Would someone please tell me what
          that was?
               (he turns to a guard)
          Alert security --

A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...

                     PRAETOR
          -- and have them run a --

The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt
from his face.

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every
living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It
disappears.

And the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY

JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in
Starfleet.

His face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress
uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.

He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been
the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.

                     PICARD
          Duty...

He lets the word resonate and then continues.

                     PICARD
          A starship captain's life is filled
          with solemn duty.  I have commanded
          men in battle.  I have negotiated
          peace treaties between implacable
          enemies.  I have represented the
          Federation in first contact with
          twenty-seven alien species.  But
          none of this compares to my solemn
          duty as... Best man.

Uproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding
reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.

The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other "Star Trek" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table.

                     PICARD
          Now, I know that on an occasion
          such as this: it is expected that I
          be gracious and fulsome with praise
          on the wonders of this blessed
          union... But have you two
          considered what you're doing to?
          This is all a damned
          inconvenience...
               (laughter from the crowd)
          While you're happily settling in on
          the Titan, I'll have to train a new
          first officer; no doubt a stern
          martinet who'll quote the rule book
          at me and never... ever... allow me
          to go on away missions.
               (laughter)
          ... Then there's the matter of my
          new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
          soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
          be probing into my darkest psyche
          as she nods her head and coos
          sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
          Deanna?

Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!

                     PICARD
          I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
          with the rest of you.  As most of
          you know, the doctor will also soon
          be leaving the Enterprise, to
          assume command of Starfleet
          Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
          Beverly, have you considered what
          you're doing to little ole' me?!
          I'll probably get some old battle-
          axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
          eat my vegetables and put me on
          report if I don't show up for my
          physical on time!

                     BEVERLY
          It'll serve you right.

Laughter, laughter, laughter!  He looks to Riker and Deanna:

                     PICARD
          Really, it's not too late to
          reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.

                     PICARD
          Will Riker, you have been my
          trusted right arm for fourteen
          years; you have helped keep my
          course true and steady.  Deanna
          Troi, you have been my conscience
          and best guide, the touchstone to
          the better parts of myself.  You
          are my family.  And in proper
          maritime tradition I wish you full
          sails and a clear horizon... My
          friends, make it so.

They drink.

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

The party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a
beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen
everywhere around us.

DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.

                     BEVERLY
               (playfully)
          Sort of like losing a son and
          gaining an empath, isn't it?

                     PICARD
          Please, Beverly, this is hard
          enough.

                     BEVERLY
          If you start tearing up I promise
          to beam you out.  Level one medical
          emergency.  There's no crying in
          Starfleet.

They head off toward Riker and Deanna.

Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.

                     LEAH
          I've never seen your Captain so
          nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
          in his old age.

                     GEORDI
               (laughs)
          Not likely.  After we installed the
          new Series Four replicators, he
          tried to order his usual tea and
          there was a glitch.  Had us remove
          the whole bunch of them and put the
          old ones back in.

                     LEAH
          There!  Nostalgic about old
          replicators.

                     GEORDI
          He just likes things the way he
          likes them...
               (he looks at her, smiles)
          Of course, so do I.

He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is
still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down
beside them, belches.

                     WORF
          Romulan ale should be illegal.

                     GEORDI
          It is, old chum.

                     WORF
          Then it should be more illegal.

He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's
going to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to
Picard and Beverly.

                     DEANNA
          Really, Captain, it was a lovely
          toast.

                     PICARD
          The least I could do for you,
          Deanna.  Besides, you know me...
          I'm a talking head.

                     DEANNA
          And you needn't worry.  I'll brief
          your new counselor on everything
          she needs to know.

                     PICARD
          The hell you will.  You know too
          much about me as it is... Now you
          promised there are no speeches
          during the ceremony on Betazed.

                     RIKER
          No, no speeches.  No clothes
          either.
               (winks, mischievously)

Picard looks at him.  Deanna laughs.

Then the band stops playing.  All turn.

DATA stands with the band.

                     DATA
          Ladies and Gentlemen and invited
          Tran gendered species... In my
          study of Terran and Betazoid
          conjugal rites I have discovered it
          is traditional to present the
          "happy couple" with a gift.  Given
          Commander Riker's affection for
          archaic musical forms I have
          elected to present the following as
          my gift in honor of their
          conjugation.

Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation?

Data turns to the band leader.

                     DATA
          If you please, Mister Band Leader,
          a-one and a-two and...

The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving
Berlin standard "Blue Skies."

                     DATA
               (sings)
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see.  Blue
          birds, singing a song, Nothing but
          blue birds all day long.  Never saw
          the sun shining so bright, Never
          saw things going so right..."

The crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he
momentarily raises his head from the table.

                     WORF
               (groans)
          Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:

                     DEANNA
               (smiles)
          All right, go ahead.

Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts
jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          May I have this dance?

                     DEANNA
          With pleasure, Captain.

Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
Beverly goes to Worf.

                     BEVERLY
          Commander Worf... Do Klingons
          swing?

                     WORF
          I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

                     BEVERLY
          Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

She pulls him to the dance floor as:

                     BEVERLY
          I'm so glad you made it back to the
          Enterprise before I left.

                     WORF
          I was not suited for the life of
          a... diplomat.

                     BEVERLY
               (wry)
          Who'd have guessed?

They dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them.

And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the
crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people.

This family.  A family we love.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise streaks through space.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.

As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still
somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and
idiosyncratic zest for life.

Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.

                     PICARD
          I've been saving this.  Chateau
          Picard 2267.  Batten down the
          hatches...

He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:

                     PICARD
          They say a vintner's history is in
          every glass.  The soil he came
          from.  His past as well as his
          hopes for the future.

He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a
toast.

                     PICARD
          So... To happy endings.

                     DATA
          To happy endings.

Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally
swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh.

Data mimics Picard.  Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor
and finally swallowing.  Ahhh.

                     DATA
          Sir.  I noticed an interesting
          confluence of emotion at the
          wedding.  I am familiar with the
          human concept of tears through
          laughter and its inverse, laughter
          through tears, but I could not help
          wondering about the human capacity
          for expressing both pleasure and
          sadness simultaneously.

                     PICARD
          I understand why it would seem
          confusing.  Certain human rituals --
          like weddings, birthdays or
          funerals evoke strong and very
          complex emotions.  These rites
          carry great weight with us because
          they denote the passage of time.

                     DATA
          And you were particularly aware of
          this feeling because Commander
          Riker will be leaving to assume
          command of the Titan?

                     PICARD
          Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
          Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
          Medical...

                     DATA
          And this makes you "sad"?

                     PICARD
          Well.  I suppose it does a bit.
          I'm very happy for them, of course,
          but I'm going to miss them.  The
          ship will seem... incomplete
          without them.

                     DATA
          That is because you have a
          familiarity with them.  You can
          predict specific reactions and
          behavior and are comfortable in
          that knowledge.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
          well.  They've made important
          choices; they're going to have
          great challenges ahead of them.
          New worlds to conquer...

He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          Seeing Will and Deanna today made
          me think about some of the choices
          I've made in my own life.  Devoting
          myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
          or having children... All the
          choices that led me here.

A beat.  Data thinks about it.

                     DATA
          The choices I made have led me here
          as well.  This is the only home I
          have ever known.  I cannot foresee
          a reason for leaving.

                     PICARD
          You never know what's over the
          horizon, Data.  Before too long
          you'll be offered a command of your
          own.  Data looks at him; he has
          never really considered this.

                     DATA
          If I were... I believe my memory
          engrams would sense the absence of
          your specific reactions and
          behavior.  I would "miss you."

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Now, you make a toast.

                     DATA
          To new worlds...

                     PICARD
          New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new
          worlds...

They drink.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial
splendor of a Senate corridor.

COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the
corridor.

Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention
to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry
sense of humor.

                     SURAN
          The fleet commanders are nervous.
          They've agreed to remain at their
          given coordinates and await his
          orders.  But they're anxious to
          know what's going on here.

                     DONATRA
          I don't blame them.  We can't keep
          them in the dark forever.

A voice, from the shadows:

                     VICEROY (V.O.)
          But in darkness, there is strength.

Donatra and Suran stop.

And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...

He is a terrifying sight  A powerful, monstrous alien
creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a
disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.  He is
vampiric and lethal.  He is a Reman.

                     VICEROY
          Don't you agree?

He leads them along the corridor.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey
clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem
from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.  As we hear:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Consider it  The great symbol of
          the Empire... But the bird-of-prey
          holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.
          Their destinies conjoined...

And then we see him... SHINZON!

He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.  Very handsome
with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.  He
wears a striking Reman military uniform.

He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.  The
entire floor is a large star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Yet for generations one of those
          planets has been without a voice.
          We will be silent no longer.

Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon
in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN
COMMANDERS sit.

Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the
chamber.  They are his sinister children of the night.  Even
more chilling now in the flickering torch light.  It's like
something out of Tim Burton.

Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Join us, Commanders.  Now what's
          the disposition of the fleet?

                     SURAN
          They're holding position.

                     SHINZON
          And?

                     SURAN
               (bows his head)
          They will obey, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          It's imperative we retain their
          allegiance or our great mission
          will be strangled before it can
          truly draw breath.

                     DONATRA
          They support your intentions, sir.
          But they require evidence of
          your... sincerity.

Shinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to
respond with benevolence.  He smiles.

                     SHINZON
          And they'll have it.
               (he begins to pace over
                the star chart)
          Tell the fleet that the days of
          negotiation and diplomacy are over.
          The Almighty Federation will fall
          before us.  As I promised you.

He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral
Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          The time we have dreamed of is at
          hand.  The time... of conquest.
               (sinister laugh)

He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the
Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart.

                     SHINZON
          Cut off the dragon's head and it
          cannot strike back.

A beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his
quiet words disturbs her.

                     SURAN
          How many Warbirds will you need?

                     SHINZON
          None.

They look at him, stunned.

                     SURAN
          Praetor.  You have the whole fleet
          at your disposal.  They supported
          the coup, they'll follow you.

                     SHINZON
          The Scimitar will serve my needs.

                     SURAN
          But surely --

                     SHINZON
          I came this far alone...
               (he looks at his Reman
                warriors)
          We came this far alone.  We require
          no assistance from the fleet.  Now
          leave me to my thoughts.

The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon
looks to his Viceroy.

                     SHINZON
          Are we prepared?

                     VICEROY
          Yes, Praetor.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          So many years for this moment.
               (he looks up at his
                Viceroy, smiles)
          Bring him to me.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the
bridge.

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          I won't do it.

                     DEANNA
          It's tradition,Worf.  You of all
          people should appreciate that!
               (whispers)
          Besides, I've already seen it.

                     WORF
          A warrior does not appear without
          his clothing.  It leaves him...
          vulnerable.

                     RIKER
          I don't think we're going to see
          much combat on Betazed.

                     DEANNA
          Don't be too sure.  Mother will be
          there.

Worf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:

                     WORF
          I won't do it.

                     PICARD
          Won't do what, Mister Worf?

                     WORF
          Captain.  I think it is
          inappropriate for a Starfleet
          officer to appear...
               (hates the word)
          ... naked.

                     PICARD
          Come now, a big, strapping fellow
          like you?  What are you afraid of?

Deanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his
attention:

                     WORF
          I'm picking up an unusual
          electromagnetic signature from the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What sort of signature?

Worf looks up.  Glances at Data.

                     WORF
          Positronic.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER

Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and
Data.

                     GEORDI
          It's very faint but I've isolated
          it to the third planet in the
          Kolarin system.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the planet?

                     GEORDI
          Uncharted.  We'll have to get
          closer for a more detailed scan.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Theories?

                     DATA
          Since positronic signatures have
          only been known to emanate from
          androids such as myself, it is
          logical to theorize that there is
          an android such as myself on
          Kolarus III.

                     GEORDI
          How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

                     DATA
          I thought only me, myself and Lore.

                     RIKER
               (looking at star chart)
          Diverting to the Kolarin system
          takes us awfully close to the
          Romulan Neutral Zone.

                     PICARD
               (looking at star chart)
          Still well on our side...

Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire
to explore this possible connection to others like himself.

                     PICARD
          I think it's worth a look.  Don't
          worry, Number One, we'll get you to
          Betazed with time to spare.

                     RIKER
          Thank you, sir...

                     PICARD
               (to all, especially Worf)
          Where we will all honor the
          Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,
          or any other parts of our anatomy.
          Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be
          in the gym.

He goes.

                     RIKER
               (to Helm Officer)
          Mister Branson, set course for the
          Kolarin system.  Warp Five --
               (Deanna shoots him a
                glance)
          -- Warp Seven.

                     HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
          Plotted and laid in, sir.

                     RIKER
          Engage.

                     DEANNA
          You better believe you're engaged!

Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station,
studying the displays.

                     GEORDI
          What do you think, Data, a long-
          lost relative?

Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is
apparent.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.  In
the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion
storm.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond
it.

                     GEORDI
          I read six distinct positronic
          signatures, spread out over a few
          kilometers on the surface.

                     PICARD
          What do we know about the
          population?

                     DATA
          Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It
          appears to be a pre-warp
          civilization at an early stage of
          industrial development.

                     GEORDI
          Captain, I don't recommend
          transporting, that ion storm
          doesn't look very neighborly.  It
          could head this way without much
          warning.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Data, Worf, you're
          with me.

Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.

                     RIKER
               (stands, protesting)
          Captain, I hope I don't have to
          remind you --

                     PICARD
          I appreciate your concern, Number
          One, but I've been itching to try
          out the Argo.

                     RIKER
          Sir --

                     PICARD
          Captain's prerogative, Will.
          There's no foreseeable danger...
          and your wife would never forgive
          me if anything happened to you.

He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.

                     PICARD
          You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

The turbolift doors slide shut.

The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to
house husband.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY

The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle
Argo emerges.

The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly
large cargo area at the back.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY

The Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert
environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death
Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The
shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay,
then...

The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf
roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!

Picard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a
mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a
Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The
Rat Patrol."

Picard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of
dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the
positronic signatures with a tricorder:

                     DATA
          The closest signature is two
          kilometers to the west... that
          direction, sir.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Data.
               (he smiles)
          Let's see what she can do.

He roars off in a cloud of dust!

Picard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert
terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited
driving panache.

Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar

                     DATA
          I will always be baffled by the
          human predilection for piloting
          vehicles at unsafe velocities.

Picard smiles and drives a little faster.

                     DATA
               (monitoring with
                tricorder)
          Over that rise, sir... half a
          kilometer.

They continue on.  Before long they can see something on the
level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to
discover...

An android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground.

                     DATA
          It appears to be...
               (he scans with his
                tricorder)
          ... an arm.

                     WORF
               (suspicious)
          Why is it moving?

                     DATA
          Like me, it has been designed with
          modular power sources.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, if you please.

Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up,
the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from
a horror movie.  Worf shudders.

He returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the
rear cargo area.

                     DATA
          The next signature is one kilometer
          to the south.

Picard starts the jeep in motion.

Time passes as they continue on... coming across another
arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various
disassembled components of a Data-like android!

EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY

Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is
only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep
into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder,
pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the
sides of the canyon.

                     DATA
          The final signature is
          approximately 300 meters up that
          incline.

                     PICARD
          Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

                     WORF
               (uneasy)
          To find the head, sir?

                     PICARD
               (amused)
          If you don't mind.

Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final
piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY

Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the
direction:

                     DATA
          Ten meters...

Worf pulls his phaser, ready.

                     DATA
          I think it unlikely you will need
          your phaser to recover the cranial
          unit.  Of course, it could bite
          you.

Then they see it.

Data's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in
the dust before them.

                     WORF
          It's you.

                     DATA
          The resemblance is... striking.

Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.  It looks up at them
with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.

                     HEAD
          Why am I looking at me?

                     DATA
          You are not looking at yourself.
          You are looking at me.

                     HEAD
               (looking at Worf)
          You do not look like me.

                     WORF
          No.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          I would like to pick you up now.
          May I do that?

                     HEAD
               (to Worf)
          You have a pretty shirt.

                     WORF
          Thank you.

Data gently picks up the head.  Looks at it.  The two
identical faces gaze at each other.

                     DATA
          Fascinating...

Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes.  Worf and Data
spin to see...

A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing
primitive plasma weapons --

Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep --
some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf
firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them --
through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:

                     HEAD
          I have two arms and ten fingers.
          Do you know where my arms are?  I
          cannot see where we are going.
          Where are we going?
               (Etc... like Threepio in
                "Empire" when he's
                strapped to Chewbacca's
                back.)

The action continues.  Then Data finds himself almost
surrounded --

                     DATA
          Commander!

Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a
perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf
catches it --

                     WORF
          STOP TALKING!

The head abruptly stops talking.

Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around
him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength
and agility.

Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like
a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally
firing his phaser --

They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble --
the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !

When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping
the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep,
firing the phaser canon.

Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the
front seat and roars off --

INT./ EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING

Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to
Data in the front seat:

                     WORF
          If you wouldn't mind.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

The head looks up at Picard.

                     HEAD
          You have a shiny head.

Picard glances at the head.

                     DATA
          He is very observant.

                     PICARD
          I can see that.

                      WORF
          Captain!

Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!  The aliens
are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          Shall we try some "unsafe
          velocities?"

He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.

Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the
aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few
dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

Meanwhile:

                     HEAD
               (to Picard)
          You have a red shirt.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          This is not an appropriate time for
          a conversation.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because the captain has to
          concentrate on piloting the
          vehicle.

                     HEAD
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Data!

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.

They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and
flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade
their pursuers --

Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the
alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire --
Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating
adventure --

Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it
is surrounded by more of the aliens!

                     PICARD
          Mister Data.  Let's make like the
          wind.

Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the
Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --

Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the
rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --

Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain
as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the
aliens -- and into the cargo bay --

INT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as
the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.

Picard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of
dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.

Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.

                     WORF
               (smiles)
          He must have Klingon blood.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

Beverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her.

                     BEVERLY
          I think you have nicer eyes.

We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands
with Picard, Riker and Geordi.

                     DATA
          Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body
parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled

                     RIKER
          Geordi?

                     GEORDI
               (at work analyzing the
                torso section)
          Well, he seems to have the same
          internal mechanics as Data but not
          as much positronic development.
          The neural pathways aren't nearly
          as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a
          prototype.  Something Dr. Soong
          created before Data.

                     DATA
               (to head)
          Do you have a name, sir?

                     HEAD
          I am the B-9.

                     PICARD
          Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for
          whimsical names seems to have no
          end.

                     HEAD
               (to Riker)
          You have a fuzzy face.

                     PICARD
               (trying to ignore the
                head)
          Keep me informed, Number One, and,
          please, put him back together.

He goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece
by piece like the Tin Man as:

                     DATA
          Can you tell me how you came to be
          on the planet where we found you?

                     B-9
               (blandly)
          I was taken from my homeworld by
          people called the "PakJeds." They
          are fat.  They traded me to a ship
          belonging to the "Bolians." The
          "Bolians" are blue.  They put me in
          a seat and asked me questions.
          Then they were attacked by another
          ship...

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more
fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.

                     B-9
          Then people called the
          Delviciansans picked me up.  They
          have long teeth.  They asked if I
          do anything to help them.  I told
          them I could do whatever they
          wanted.  They asked me to clean out
          the matrix manifolds.  I told them
          I did not know what an Matrix
          manifold looks like.

                     BEVERLY
          Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics
          to run on some medical scanner
          things.

She quickly exits.

                     B-9
          And after they showed me the
          "engine manifolds." Then they
          showed me something called a
          "plasma mop"

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely
assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind.

                     B-9
          ... then the "Cardassians" put me
          into something called a "garbage
          chute" and I went out into space
          again --

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Worf to Commander Riker.  I have
          the tactical manifests ready, sir.

                     RIKER
               (quickly tapping his comm
                badge)
          Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right
          there!...
               (he stands)
          Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

He escapes.

                     B-9
          Fuzzy face is gone.

                     DATA
          Yes, please continue.

                     B-9
          I was in space for a long time.
          Then a ship belonging to the
          "Talosians" picked me up.  They
          asked me where I came from.  I told
          them people called the "Pakleds"
          took me from my homeworld.  They
          are fat...

Geordi groans.

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is
slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is
fully assembled.

                     B-9
          Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

A beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale...

                     DATA
          Do you know who I am?

                     B-9
          You are me.

                     DATA
          No.  My name is Data... I am your
          brother.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.

                     DEANNA
               (to Worf)
          ... and after the ceremony on
          Betazed, three entire weeks for our
          honeymoon.

                     RIKER
          We're going sailing on the Opal
          Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned
          solar catamaran.  Just us and the
          sun and the waves.

                     WORF
          It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

                     DEANNA
               (amused)
          It's meant to be relaxing.

                     WORF
          A Klingon honeymoon begins with the
          Kholamar desert march where the
          couple bonds in endurance trials.
          If they survive the challenge they
          move on to the Fire Caves of
          Fek'lhr to face the demons of
          Gre'thor.

                     RIKER
          Well, that sounds relaxing too.

                     WORF
          It is... invigorating.

They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.

                     RIKER
          So they've got him up and running.

                     WORF
          He's a very unusual android

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          Runs in the family.

They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs
him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data
shows him how use a napkin.

A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches
Data and the B-9.

There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other
somewhat like a slow, simple child.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Picard is at his replicator unit.

                     PICARD
          Earl Grey, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds.

                     PICARD
          Come.
               (Deanna enters)
          Counselor.

                     DEANNA
          Do you have a moment, sir?

                     PICARD
          Of course, sit down.

He sits at his desk  She sits across from him.

                     DEANNA
          It's about Data  I've watched him
          with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
          Data's desire for a "family" is
          very strong.  I'm afraid he may be
          investing too much in the B-9.

                     PICARD
          You're speaking of emotional
          investment?

                     DEANNA
          The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
          And Data, in his own way, has
          assumed the position of a parent or
          guardian.  I'm afraid he has
          expectations based on his own
          experiences.  He'll be disappointed
          when the B-9 cannot meet those
          expectations.

                     PICARD
          As much as we care for him,
          Deanna... we have to remember that
          Data isn't capable of
          disappointment.

                     DEANNA
          I don't believe that, sir.  We've
          shared many disappointing journeys.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          I'm going to miss you.

                     DEANNA
          And I you.

They are interrupted by a comm signal:

                     RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, you have an Alpha Priority
          communication from Starfleet
          Command.

                     PICARD
          Acknowledged...
               (Deanna stands)
          ... I'll talk to Data

                     DEANNA
          Thank you, sir.

She goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.

ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway
is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her
well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth
charm which made her a household name and beloved cult
figure.

                     PICARD
          Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip
          to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          With or without the rest of the
          fleet?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          A diplomatic mission.  We've been
          invited, believe it or not.  Seems
          there's been some kind of internal
          political shakeup.  The new
          Praetor, someone called Shinzon,
          has requested a Federation envoy.

                     PICARD
          New Praetor?

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          There's more... as always.  He's
          Reman.
               (Picard is surprised)
          Believe me, we don't understand it
          either.  You're the closest ship so
          I want you to high tail it over
          there and hear what he has to say.
          Get the lay of the land, If the
          Empire becomes unstable, it could
          mean trouble for the entire
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
          Understood.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
          We're sending you all the
          intelligence we have, but it's not
          much.  I don't need to tell you to
          watch your back, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Not with the Romulans.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (smiles wryly)
          The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,
          the evil Soran and that pesky
          Nexus.  You seem to get all the
          easy assignments!

                     PICARD
          Just lucky, Admiral.

                     JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Let's hope that luck holds.
          Janeway out.

The transmission ends.

Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the
bridge

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard goes to his command chair:

                     PICARD
               (to Helm)
          Lay in a new course... Take us to
          Romulus.  Warp eight.

The crew is shocked.

                     HELM OFFICER
          Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and
          laid in...

                     RIKER
          Romulus?

                     PICARD
          I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have
          to wait, Number One... Engage.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a
flash of dazzling light.  Yes!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY

Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors
currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around
their sun.

                     DATA
          As you can see the habitable half
          of Remus is always in darkness
          because, like Mercury, one side
          always faces the sun.  Due to the
          extreme temperatures on that half
          of their world, the Remans live on
          the dark side of the planet.

Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate
Data's words:

                     DATA
          Almost nothing is known about the
          Reman homeworld, although
          intelligence scans have proven the
          existence of dilithium mining and
          heavy weapons construction.

Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely
make out the monstrous figures:

                     DATA
          The Remans themselves are
          considered an undesirable caste in
          the hierarchy of the Empire.

                     RIKER
          But they also have the reputation
          of being formidable warriors.  In
          the Dominion War, Reman forces were
          used as assault troops in the most
          violent encounters.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          Cannon fodder.

                     GEORDI
          Then how did a Reman get to be
          Praetor?  I don't get it.

                     RIKER
          We have to assume he had Romulan
          collaborators.

                     PICARD
          A coup d'etat?

                     RIKER
          The Praetor's power has always been
          the Romulan fleet.  They must be
          behind him.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          What have you learned about
          Shinzon?

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

                     DATA
          Starfleet intelligence was only
          able to provide a partial account
          of his military record.  We can
          infer he is relatively young and a
          capable commander.  He fought
          seventeen major engagements in the
          war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
          we know nothing.

                     PICARD
          Well... it seems we're truly
          sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
          it.  Anything you can give me would
          be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

                     DATA
          At present he serves no useful
          function.  Dr. Soong created us to
          become active and useful members of
          society.  I do not believe he would
          have wanted the B-9 to live out his
          life in his present state.

                     GEORDI
          I can't believe the Captain went
          along with a memory download.

                     DATA
          Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
          was probably designed with the same
          self-actualization parameters as
          myself.  If my memory engrams are
          successfully integrated into his
          positronic matrix, he should have
          all my abilities.

                     GEORDI
          He'd have all your memories too.
          You feel comfortable with that?

                     DATA
          I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
          belief that with my memory engrams
          he will be able to function as a
          more complete individual.

                     GEORDI
          An individual more like you, you
          mean.

                     DATA
          Yes.

                     GEORDI
          Maybe he's not supposed to be like
          you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
          just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

                     GEORDI
          Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

                     DATA
               (to B-9)
          Do you know where you are?

                     B-9
          I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

                     DATA
          Can you remember our father?

                     B-9
          No.

Data glances to Geordi.

                     DATA
          Do you know the name of the Captain
          of this vessel?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Is that your final answer?

                     GEORDI
               (to B-9)
          Do you know my name?

                     B-9
          You have a soft voice.

                     GEORDI
               (gently)
          Data, he's assimilating a lot of
          programming.  Remember, he's a
          prototype, a lot less sophisticated
          than you are.  We just don't know
          if his matrix will be able to
          adapt.  Or if he'll be able to
          retain anything.  We should give
          him some time.

Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.

                     DATA
          What purpose does this serve?

                     GEORDI
               (also examining circuitry)
          It seems to be a redundant memory
          port.  Maybe it's for provisional
          memory storage in case his neural
          pathways overload?

                     DATA
          Dr. Soong must have found it
          unnecessary in later versions.

                     GEORDI
          It's possible the extra memory port
          is interfering with the engram
          processing.  Mind if I keep him
          here and run some diagnostics?

                     DATA
          No, I do not mind.

Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.

                     DATA
          But I believe he will prove
          incapable of performing higher
          functions.

                     GEORDI
          Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,
          I know, you're not capable of hope.

                     DATA
               (looking at B-9)
          I am not.

Data stands.  The B-9 stands to follow.

                     DATA
          No, remain with Commander La Forge.
          He is going to try to make you
          well.

The B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen
in the distance.

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.
          The Enterprise has arrived at
          Romulus and is waiting at the
          designated coordinates.  All our
          hails have gone unanswered.  We've
          been waiting for seventeen hours.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew is tense.  Silence.

Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to
release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit.

                     RIKER
          Why don't they answer our hails?

                     PICARD
          It's an old psychological strategy,
          Number One.  To put him in a
          position of dominance and make us
          uneasy.

                     RIKER
          It's working.

                     PICARD
               (to Deanna)
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          They're out there, sir.

Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at
Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
They're out there, Waiting.

                     WORF
          Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

                     PICARD
          Not yet, Mister Worf.

                     RIKER
          Captain, with all due respect to
          diplomatic protocols -- the
          Federation Council's not sitting
          out here, we are.

                     PICARD
          Patience.  Diplomacy is a very
          exacting occupation.  We can wait.

                     DATA
          Captain...

And on the viewscreen.

Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks
directly before the Enterprise.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely
breathtaking.

Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional
Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is
huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is
aggressive.  Awesome in its power.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
               (slowly rising from his
                chair)
          My God...

                     WORF
               (tense)
          Should I raise shields?

                     PICARD
          No!

                     WORF
          Captain -- !

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

                     WORF
               (quickly analyzing
                tactical display)
          Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-
          seven photon torpedo bays, primary
          and secondary phased shields.

                     RIKER
          She's not out for a pleasure
          cruise.

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          She's a predator.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:

Shinzon's Viceroy.

He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.  The bridge is as unique
as the rest of Shinzon's ship.  Instead of the usual
mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost
Asian simplicity.  Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare
and elegant.

Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most
of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core
relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the
bridge.

The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of
the viceroy.

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Enterprise.  We are the Reman
          Warbird Scimitar.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

                     VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I am not Shinzon.  I am his
          Viceroy.  We are sending transport
          coordinates.

The transmission ends abruptly.  The Scimitar reappears on
the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Not very chatty.

                     PICARD
          Away team.  Transporter room four.

Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the
turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The away team materializes in the most striking location on
Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.

It is a huge, empty chamber.  No furniture.  A simple Reman
mat on the floor is the only decoration.  At the very top of
the room there is a large, etched glass dome.

It is very dark.

They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you'll forgive the
          darkness... we're not comfortable
          in the light.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon?

Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more
illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.

The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is
evident he is human.  Assuming that he was Reman, they're
surprised by this realization.

Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a
moment.

                     SHINZON
          Captain Picard... Jean Luc
          Picard... I don't mean to stare,
          it's just -- well, you can't
          imagine how long I've been waiting
          for this moment.  I always imagined
          you taller, isn't that odd?
               (to Data)
          You may scan me without subterfuge,
          Commander Data.

Data scans him with a tricorder as:

                     PICARD
          And you're not as we imagined you.

                     SHINZON
          No?

                     WORF
          You are human.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Worf.
               (he speaks in Klingon)
          I greet you as a valiant warrior...
          and as my brother.

                     WORF
               (terse, in Klingon)
          I'll save my greetings for a better
          brother.

Shinzon laughs, maniacally.

                     PICARD
          Why have you asked for our presence
          here?

Shinzon does not answer.  He is staring deeply at Deanna,
moans softly.

                     PICARD
          Praetor?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I've never met a human woman.

He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.

                     DEANNA
          I'm only half human.

                     SHINZON
          Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic
          and telepathic abilities, ship's
          counselor.  All of this I knew...
          But I didn't know you were so
          beautiful.

                     RIKER
          You seem very familiar with our
          personnel.

Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from
her.

                     SHINZON
          I am, Commander Riker...
               (to Deanna)
          ... May I touch your hair?

                     PICARD
               (firm)
          Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a
          matter we were -- assured was of
          great importance.  If you have
          anything to say to us as
          representatives of the Federation,
          I suggest you do so now.

Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.  It is strangely
seductive.  Almost disquieting in its intensity.  Deanna
handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.

                     SHINZON
               (softly)
          On the world I come from there's no
          light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't
          important.  I see now there's a
          world elsewhere.

                     PICARD
          Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to
          discuss your lack of a social life.

                     SHINZON
               (turning back to Picard)
          Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
               (he smiles)
          There's so much we have to talk
          about.

                     PICARD
          I would be interested to know what
          we are talking about.

                     SHINZON
          Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the
          walls between us to recognize we
          are one people.  Federation and
          Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and
          Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of
          the thing that makes us the same.
          We want peace.

Picard and the others are stunned.

                     SHINZON
          I want to end the centuries of
          mistrust.  I want to be your ally,
          not your enemy.  As a first step I
          propose we eliminate the Neutral
          Zone and begin a free and open
          exchange of goods and ideas.

                     PICARD
          And the Senate supports you?

                     SHINZON
               (dry)
          I have dissolved the Senate.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          Right now, you're thinking this all
          sounds too good to be true?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you're wondering why the
          Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this
          the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a
          predator?
               (Picard is startled at
                Shinzon's choice of
                words)
          ... But you're also thinking the
          chance for peace is too promising
          to ignore.  Above all, you're
          trying to decide if you can trust
          me.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          Then perhaps the time has come to
          add some illumination to our
          discussion.  Computer, raise
          lighting four levels.

Lights shoot up around the room.

For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard
actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the
crew doesn't understand his reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Allow me to tell you a story that I
          hope will clarify my position.
          When I was very young I was
          stricken with an odd disease.  I
          developed a hyper-sensitivity to
          sound.  The slightest whisper
          caused me agony...

Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense.

                     SHINZON
          No one knew what to do.  Finally I
          was taken to a doctor who had some
          experience with Terran illnesses
          and I was finally diagnosed with
          Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of
          it, Captain?

                     PICARD
          You know I do.

The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.

                     SHINZON
          Then you know it's a very rare
          syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male
          members of my family had it.
          Eventually I was treated.  Now I
          can hear as well as you can,
          Captain.

He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.

                     SHINZON
          I can see as well as you can.  I
          can feel everything you feel.
               (He stops right before
                Picard)
          In fact, I feel exactly what you
          feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and
curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange,
remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his
at that age.

                     SHINZON
          Do you trust me now?

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We need to talk, just you and I.

                     SHINZON
          Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
          Just the two of us.  Or just the
          one of us.

                     PICARD
          You know I need to verify this.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to
outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife
and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife
to Data.

                     SHINZON
          Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so
          much to discuss.

Picard touches his communicator pin:

                     PICARD
          Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam
          out.

They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating
Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as
the transporter effect ripples around him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman
knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts
and analysis are visible.

                     BEVERLY
          There's no doubt, Captain.  Right
          down to your regressive strain of
          Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

A beat as the confirmation sinks in.

                     PICARD
          When was he... created?

                     BEVERLY
          About twenty-five years ago.  They
          probably used a hair follicle or
          skin cell.

                     PICARD
               (touching head)
          I think a skin cell's the more
          likely of the two.

                     RIKER
          Why?

                     PICARD
          Believe me, Number One; I'm going
          to find out.  Contact Starfleet
          Command and inform them of the
          situation.  I need to know where
          the hell he came from.  Deanna.

He goes, Deanna following.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

                     DEANNA
          I would say he's been trained to
          resist telepathy.  What I could
          sense of his emotions were erratic,
          very hard to follow.

                     PICARD
          Is he sincere about wanting peace?

                     DEANNA
          I don't know.
               (she stops him)
          Sir, the strongest sense I had was
          that he's more than curious about
          you.  He very much wants to know
          you.
               (she looks at him deeply)
          The same way you want to know him.

                     PICARD
          How could I not?

                     DEANNA
          Captain, don't assume he's anything
          like you are.  You should resist
          the urge to think you know him.

                     PICARD
          I not only know him, Deanna, I am
          him... and he is me!

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been
working for hours.

                     DEANNA
          Will, you need to rest.
               (he continues to work)
          As ship's counselor, I'm
          recommending you get me sleep.

Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up
her.

                     RIKER
          Some honeymoon.

She smiles and goes to him.

                     DEANNA
          We have time.
               (she kisses him)
          Come to bed.

She pulls him up.

                     RIKER
          Imzadi, what am I going to do with
          you?

They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they
fall into the bed.

It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him
sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but
something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond.

She starts back, her eyes growing wide.

Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon!

                     SHINZON
          Imzadi.  This is so good.

                     DEANNA
          No!

He caresses her face...

                     SHINZON
          He can never know you as I know
          you... He can never touch you as I
          touch you.

                     DEANNA
          This isn't real.

                     SHINZON
          Can you feel my hands... are they
          real?  Can you feel my lips, my
          loins?

He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It
is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She
is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all?

Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I'm with you, Imzadi...

And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:

                     SHINZON
          I'll always be with you now.  Now
          and forever...

                     DEANNA
          You sick bastard!

She pushes him away...

                     RIKER
          Deanna?!  What's with the name
          calling?

It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him
desperately.

EXT.  ROMULAN SENATE - DAY

The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon
is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator
Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely.

Commander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His
Viceroy lurks in a corner.

                     SURAN
          ... then I don't understand the
          reason for the delay!

                     SHINZON
          You don't have to understand.

                     SURAN
          And bringing the Enterprise here?!
          What possible purpose could that
          serve?!

                     SHINZON
          I have a purpose.

                     SURAN
          Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          Silence, Romulan!

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

                     SHINZON
          You must learn patience, Commander.
          Do you know where I learned it?  In
          the dilithium mines of Remus.
          Spend eighteen hours every day
          under the lash of a Romulan guard's
          whip and you'll soon understand
          patience.

                     SURAN
               (carefully bows his head)
          Praetor.

                     SHINZON
          Now go.  I have some personal
          business.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

                     DONATRA
          How long before he has us in the
          dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

                     SHINZON
          And when I was ready they were
          going to replace you with me, an
          exact biological duplicate.  Put a
          Romulan agent at the heart of
          Starfleet to influence your command
          structure.  It was a bold plan.

                     PICARD
          What happened?

                     SHINZON
          As happens so frequently here on
          Romulus, a new government came to
          power.  They decided to abandon the
          plan -- frankly, I think they were
          afraid I'd be discovered and it
          would lead to war.  They weren't
          ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

                     SHINZON
          Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I
          can't stand it.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          You'll acquire a taste for it.

A beat.  They look at each other.

                     SHINZON
          It's not quite the face you
          remember.

                     PICARD
          Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

                     SHINZON
          A lifetime of violence will do
          that.  My nose was broken four
          times.  And my jaw... But so much
          is the same.  The eyes, you
          recognize the eyes.

                     PICARD
          Yes.  The eyes have it.

                     SHINZON
          Our eyes reflect our lives, don't
          they?  Yours are so confident.

                     PICARD
          How did you end up on Remus?

                     SHINZON
          They sent me there to die.  How
          could a mere human survive the
          dilithium mines?  It was...
               (he can't find the words)
          ... I was a slave.  And a monster.
          The only thing the Romulan guards
          hated more than the Remans was me.
          But one man took pity on me: the
          man who became my Viceroy.  He
          taught me how to survive.  And in
          that dark place, where there was
          nothing of myself, I found my Reman
          brothers.  They showed me the only
          kindness I ever knew.

A beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.

                     SHINZON
          For thousands of years the Romulan
          Senate has met in this chamber and
          dictated the fate of its sister-
          planet... But the time has come for
          us to live as equals.

                     PICARD
          You're doing this to liberate the
          Remans?

                     SHINZON
          No race should be a slave to
          another.

Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.

                     SHINZON
          You don't trust me.

                     PICARD
          I have no reason to.

                     SHINZON
          Of course you do.  If you had lived
          my life and experienced the
          suffering of my people... you'd be
          sitting where I am now.  At least I
          hope you would.

                     PICARD
          And if you had lived my life you
          would understand that there is a
          great responsibility in
          representing the Federation.  I
          can't let my personal feelings
          unduly influence my decisions.

                     SHINZON
          All I have is my personal feelings.
          I wasn't raised with the ideals of
          the Federation.  But I'm trying to
          understand them now.  To live up to
          them   To live up to you.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          I want to know where I come from.
          The Remans gave me a future.  You
          can tell me about my past.

                     PICARD
          There's so much, and so much of it
          is dull...

                     SHINZON
          Were we always explorers?

                     PlCARD
          No.  I was the first Picard to
          leave Earth.  It caused quite a
          stir, In fact.  But I had spent my
          whole life...

                     SHINZON
               (finishing the sentence)
          Looking up at the stars.

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     SHINZON
          And you dreamed about what was up
          there.  About...

                     PICARD
               (finishing the sentence)
          New worlds.

A beat.

They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same
instant.  Stop.

                     PICARD
          After you, Praetor.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          Age before rank, Jean Luc.

Picard smiles, pours a glass.

                     PICARD
          So I'm not as tall as you expected?

                     SHINZON
          I always hoped I would hit two
          meters.

                     PICARD
          With a full head of hair.

                     SHINZON
               (smiles)
          There is that.

A quiet beat.

                     PICARD
          Shinzon... I'm trying to believe
          you.

                     SHINZON
          I know.

                     PICARD
          If there's one ideal the Federation
          holds most dear it's that all men,
          all races, can be united.  From the
          first time the Vulcans came to
          Earth we've sought a future of
          peace.  Nothing would make me more
          proud than to take your hand in
          friendship.  In time.  When trust
          has been earned.

                     SHINZON
          I'm honored to think I might
          someday speak with such eloquence.

A beat.

                     SHINZON
          In time, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          In time.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER

Picard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters.

                     VICEROY
          This is a mistake.

                     SHINZON
          He's gentler than I thought.  And
          he has a sense of humor.

                     VICEROY
               (stern)
          Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
          We should act.  Now.  Time is
          running out.

                     SHINZON
               (snaps)
          My time.  I'll spend it how I
          choose.

A tense beat.

                     SHINZON
          We'll return to the Scimitar.
          Prepare yourself for the bonding.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

                     WORF
          Sir, we've had an unauthorized
          access into the main computer.

                     PICARD
          Who was it?

                     GEORDI
          It's going to take some time to
          find out -- the data stream was
          rerouted through substations all
          over the ship.

                     PICARD
          What programs were accessed?

                     GEORDI
          That's what I don't get -- it's
          mostly basic stellar cartography:
          star charts; communications
          protocols; some uplinks from colony
          tracking stations.  It's not even
          restricted material.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          Set up a security program to detect
          any unusual data stream rerouting.
          If it happens again, we want to be
          ready.

                     GEORDI
               (grim)
          There's something else.  I was
          reviewing the sensor logs...
               (he refers to some
                readouts on his console)
          When the Scimitar decloaked there
          was a momentary spike in the
          tertiary EM band -- there -- You're
          not going to believe this but it's
          Thalaron.

Picard is shocked.

INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.

                     PICARD
          ... I thought Thalaron radiation
          was theoretical.

                     GEORDI
          Which is why our initial scans
          didn't pick it up.  But he's got
          it, Captain.

                     PICARD
          As I remember, Thalaron research
          was banned in the Federation
          because of its bioqenic properties.

                     BEVERLY
          It has the ability to consume
          organic material at the subatomic
          level.  I can't overestimate the
          danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean
          Luc.  A microscopic amount could
          kill every living thing on this
          ship in a matter of seconds.

                     PICARD
          Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to
          know what he has and how to
          neutralize any threat.  Give me
          options.

Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment.

                     DATA
          Doctor, will you excuse us for a
          moment?  Geordi, please come with
          me.

He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical
displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply
concerned.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo
album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply
troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face
before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon.

The door comm chirps.

                     PICARD
          Come...
               (Beverly enters)
          ... Beverly, come in.

                     BEVERLY
          You're working late.

She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Remember him?

                     BEVERLY
          He was a bit proud as I recall.

                     PICARD
          He was a damn fool.  Selfish and
          ambitious.  Very much in need of
          seasoning.

                     BEVERLY
          He turned out all right.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

                     PICARD
          I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
          But the Thalaron radiation can't be
          explained away.  Whatever he's
          after, it's not peace.

                     BEVERLY
          Is he very much like you were?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

Data interrupts on comm:

                     DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and
          I have identified the source of the
          unauthorized computer access.  And,
          I believe, we have also discovered
          an opportunity to gain a tactical
          advantage.

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          On my way...

                     BEVERLY
               (stands)
          Jean Luc -- whatever you were --
          right now you're the man you've
          made yourself.  He's someone else.

                     PICARD
          I wish I could believe that,
          Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Imzadi...

Shinzon stands across from her.

                     DEANNA
          You're not here.

                     SHINZON
               (moving to her)
          Very logical, Deanna... But your
          heart doesn't constrain itself to
          mere logic.
               (he caresses her)
          ... Your heart longs to discover
          me.  To know me...
               (he kisses her)
          ... To leave all of this behind and
          be with me.

He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost
violence.

                     DEANNA
          No...

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your desire, Deanna...

She forces herself to concentrate... to resist
telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is
hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing...
bending...

And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although
entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has
actually traveled.

She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes
she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.

On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna:

                     SHINZON
          I can feel your hunger to know the
          Reman ways... the old ways.

Then the world changes again...

Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her,
whispering:

                     SHINZON
          Don't fear what you desire...

She forces him away from her and --

She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with
emotion.

INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame.
Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head.

                     VICEROY
          The bond is broken.

                     SHINZON
          Find her again.

                     VICEROY
          No -- this is wasting time.

                     SHINZON
          Do as I tell you!

A Reman officer interrupts on comm:

                     REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
          Praetor, we've received the
          transponder signal.

                     SHINZON
               (to comm)
          On my way.

He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness
overtaking him.

The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange
moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's
chest.  His mind... probing.

Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.

                     VICEROY
          It's accelerating.  You have no
          more time for games.

                     SHINZON
          Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
          on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

                     SHINZON
          Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

                     SHINZON
          Welcome home.
               (to Engineers)
          Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

                     SHINZON
          Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

                     BEVERLY
          Aside from slightly elevated
          adrenalin and serotonin levels,
          you're completely normal.

                     PICARD
               (gently)
          Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

                     DEANNA
          It was... a violation.

Riker takes her hand.

                     DEANNA
               (with difficulty)
          Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the
          ability to reach into my thoughts.
          I've become a liability... I
          request to be relieved of my
          duties.

                     PICARD
          Permission denied.  If you can
          possibly endure any more of these
          assaults.  I need you at my side.
          Now more than ever I...

But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to
dematerialize!

                     RIKER
               (to comm)
          Worf!  Raise Shields !

But Picard is gone.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scimitar cloaks.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has
been removed.

Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus
is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV
tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work
over the mysterious chair.

Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the
other side of the force field.

Picard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now
visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate
spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.

                     SHINZON
          Hello, Jean Luc.

                     PICARD
          Why am I here?

                     SHINZON
          I was lonely...
               (he realizes Picard is
                staring at the veins on
                his face)
          Perhaps I'm not aging as well as
          you did.

He nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field.
A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.

                     PICARD
               (resists)
          What are you doing?

                     SHINZON
          I need a sample of your blood.
          What do your Borg friends say?
          Resistance is futile.
               (maniacal laugh)

The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard
glances to the B-9.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.
          I learned there might be an
          existing prototype from a
          Cardassian historian, then went to
          a great deal of trouble to find it
          and scatter it about on Kolarus
          III.  I knew it would pique your
          curiosity and conveniently make the
          Enterprise the closest ship to
          Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

The Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is
reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical
apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As:

                     PICARD
          All of this so you could capture
          me?

                     SHINZON
          Don't be so vain.  After we found
          it, we made a few modifications.
          An extra memory port, a hidden
          transponder.  Perhaps your eyes
          will be a bit less confident when
          you learn I've gained access to
          Starfleet's communications
          protocols.  I now know the location
          of your entire fleet...
               (to B-9)
          ... You may go.

                     B-9
          Where?

                     SHINZON
          Out of my sight.

The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:

                     SHINZON
          Maybe I'll train it to do little
          tricks for me like your robot does.
          Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head
          off.

                     PICARD
          What's this all about?

                     SHINZON
          It's about destiny, Picard.  About
          a Reman outcast who --

                     PICARD
          You're not Reman.

                     SHINZON
          And I'm not quite human.  So what
          am I?  What do you see?
               (he peers at Picard
                deeply)
          Do you see a life you might have
          led?  Lost youth never to be
          recaptured?

                     PICARD
          I see a young man trying
          desperately to deny who he is.

                     SHINZON
          I see an old man, set in his ways,
          afraid to live without a uniform to
          prop him up and a Starfleet
          regulation to tell him what to do.
          I see the man I will never be.

                     PICARD
          I won't defend my life to you.

                     SHINZON
          My life is meaningless as long as
          you're alive.  What am I while you
          exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

                     PICARD
               (stern)
          If your issues are with me... This
          has nothing to do with my ship and
          nothing to do with the Federation.

                     SHINZON
          Oh, but it does.  We will no longer
          bow like slaves before anyone.  Not
          the Romulans and not your mighty
          Federation.  We're a race bred for
          war.  For conquest.

                     PICARD
          Think about what you're doing,
          Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge
          the entire quadrant into war to
          satisfy your own personal demons?

                     SHINZON
          It amazes me how little you know
          yourself.

                     PICARD
          I'm incapable of such an act, and
          so are you.

                     SHINZON
          I think the facts speak for
          themselves.  The same noble Picard
          blood runs in our veins.  Had you
          lived my life, you'd be doing
          exactly as I am.  Look in the
          mirror, and see yourself.

Shinzon looks at him deeply.

                     SHINZON
          Consider that, Captain.  I can
          think of no greater torment for
          you.

He turns to go.

                     PICARD
          It's a mirror for you as well...

Shinzon turns back to him.

A beat.  Picard gazes at him evenly.

Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.  He glances
to the ghoulish medical preparations.

                     SHINZON
          Not for long, Captain.
               (back to Picard)
          I'm afraid you won't survive to
          witness the victory of the echo
          over the voice.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The ship is on Red Alert.  Worf stands at tactical, muscles
coiled, hungry for action.

                     WORF
          No response to our hails.

Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.  Riker stands
over him:

                     GEORDI
               (frustrated)
          His cloak is perfect... no tachyon
          emissions, no residual antiprotons.

                     RIKER
          Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.  She carries a medical
padd.

                     BEVERLY
          Will, I need to talk to you.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the
security force field, trying to spot any weakness.

Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor
weapon.

                     B-9
               (to Reman guard)
          I am to take the prisoner to the
          Praetor.

The Reman Guard deactivates the force field.

                     B-9
          If you resist, I will incapacitate
          you.

He leads Picard out.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The B-9 leads Picard through the dark corridors, holding the
disruptor on him steadily.  All the Remans they pass glare at
Picard with undisguised loathing.

The Viceroy approaches.  Stops before them.

                     VICEROY
               (to B-9)
          Where are you taking him?

                     B-9
          Praetor Shinzon wants him on the
          bridge.

The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.

                     VICEROY
          So, human... you've met your better
          self!

                     PICARD
          What are you doing to Counsellor
          Troi?

                     VICEROY
          I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To
          sooth him as she soothes you.  To
          stand at his side as she does at
          yours.

                     PICARD
          That will never happen.

                     VICEROY
          Listen to him, android.  Such a
          small and weak creature.  Yet he
          roars so valiantly...
               (he raises one taloned
                claw and puts a sharp
                fingernail on Picard's
                chest)
          It would take me but an instant to
          tear that valiant heart from your
          chest.

                     PICARD
          There'll be another after me.  And
          another after that.  You'll find
          we're a resilient species.

                     VICEROY
          I look forward to the sport.
               (to the B-9, harshly)
          Take him.

The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
Picard grimaces in pain

                     B-9
          Move.

The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads
Picard along.

                     PICARD
               (whispers)
          Be careful of over-playing your
          part, Commander!

And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the
B-9 and rejoices.

                     DATA
          Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a
          touch of reality to the
          performance.

They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then:

                     DATA
          My mission was a success, sir.  I
          have discovered the source of the
          Thalaron radiation.

                     PICARD
          Good work.  The download?

                     DATA
          He believes he has our
          communications protocols.  But they
          will give him inaccurate locations
          for all Starfleet vessels.

Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some
Reman Warriors.

                     DATA
          Move, puny human animal.

They pass the Warriors.

                     PICARD
          A bit less florid, Data.

                     DATA
          Aye, sir... This way.

He leads Picard down the corridor.

INT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a
cathedral.  It is the size of a small town.

The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.

                     DATA
          This entire ship is, essentially, a
          flying Thalaron generator.
               (he points up)
          All its power relays lead to that
          device.

High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a
gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the
Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking.

                     PICARD
          A weapon.

                     DATA
          It would appear so.

Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward,
exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a
small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation
technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.)

                     DATA
          Geordi equipped me with the
          prototype for the Emergency
          Transport Unit.  I recommend you
          use it to return to the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          It'll only work for one of us.

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.

                     PICARD
          We'll find a way off together.
          Recommendations?

                     DATA
          There is a shuttlebay 948 meters
          from our current location.

Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the
chamber.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops.

                     VICEROY
          Where's Picard?

Shinzon looks at him, confused.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman
commands are broadcast through the corridors.

                     DATA
          This way, sir!

They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman
warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the
disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --

A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-
to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.

More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a
disruptor.

And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle
breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions
illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.

They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the
shuttlebay door -- it does not open.

                     DATA
               (looking at door security
                panel)
          It seems to have an encrypted
          security system.

Reman warriors are closing in on them.

Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and
instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire
down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff --
keeping the Remans at bay --

As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay
door security panel at an amazing rate --

                     PICARD
          Alacrity would be appreciated,
          Commander.

                     DATA
          They are trying to override the
          access codes.  Reman is really a
          most complex language with
          pictographs representing certain
          verb roots and --

                     PICARD
          While I find that fascinating,
          Data, we really need that Goddamned
          door open!

The shuttlebay door slides open.

Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and
Data duck into the shuttlebay.

INT.  SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a
disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.

They turn to face...

A fleet of very small shuttles.  They are uniquely designed.
Extremely compact and stream-lined.  A disruptor turret on
each.

They move toward one as:

                     DATA
          According to the ship's manifest
          they are Scorpion-class attack
          fliers.

They quickly climb a Scorpion.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.  Picard climbs into
the pilot's position.  Data assumes the gunner's position.

They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to
the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:

                     PICARD
               (trying to figure out the
                controls)
          What do you imagine this is?

                     DATA
          Port thrusters, sir.  Would you
          like me to drive?

Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.  The
Scorpion lifts off.  Hovers a few feet over the deck.  Picard
elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay
external doors as:

                     PICARD
          Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.
          They have instigated security
          overrides and erected a force field
          around the external portals.

                     PICARD
          Well then... only one way to go.

He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors
they came through, the doors back into the ship.

Data is dubious.

                     DATA
          Do you think this is a wise course
          of action?

                     PICARD
          We're about to find out... Power up
          disruptors and fire on my mark.

                     DATA
          Ready, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!  The doors into
the ship explode!  Picard powers forward!

INT.  SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned
Remans.  Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of
the corridor but keeps control.

The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING

Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to
control the world's fastest roller coaster.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through
the ship at breakneck speed --

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.

The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --

A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top
of the room --

And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through
the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.

                     RIKER
          Worf!  Lock on transporters!

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.

                     SHINZON
          Tractor beam!  Now!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
Picard and Data climb out --

                     PICARD
               (to comm)
          Number One, emergency warp!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING

The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling
over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to...

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through
space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan
collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now.

                     SHINZON
          The Enterprise is immaterial!  They
          won't make it back to Federation
          space.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (angry)
          This has gone far enough!

                     SHINZON
          I thought we discussed patience,
          Commander.

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          And mine is wearing thin, young
          man!  We supported you because you
          promised action.  And yet you delay
          and you waste your time playing
          games with Picard while --

Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic 
exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.

                     SHINZON
          Commander Suran, the games are
          over.  In two days the Federation
          will be crippled beyond repair.
          Does that satisfy you?

                     SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
               (grim)
          For the moment.

                     SHINZON
               (brutal)
          And when I return... you and I
          shall have a little talk about
          showing proper respect!

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING

The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit
for a silent beat.

                     DONATRA
          Does anyone in this room harbor any
          illusions about what he means by
          "showing proper respect"?

                     TAL'AURA
          What's happening to his face?

                     SURAN
          I want opinions.  He is clearly out
          of his mind.

                     SURAN
          But can he complete his mission?

                     DONATRA
          Should he?

They look at her.

                     DONATRA
          Are you prepared to have your hands
          drenched in blood?  He'll show them
          no mercy.  And his sins will mark
          us all for generations.  Is that
          what you truly want, Romulans?

A beat.

                     DONATRA
          I think you should consider that
          question now -- or else you may
          have a lifetime to think about it
          in the dilithium mines.

She turns and stalks out.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.

                     BEVERLY
          The more I studied his DNA the more
          confusing it got.  Finally I could
          only come to one conclusion...
          Shinzon was created with temporal
          RNA sequencing.  He was designed so
          that at a certain point his aging
          process could be accelerated to
          reach your age more quickly, so he
          could replace you.

                     PICARD
          But the Romulans abandoned the
          plan...

                     BEVERLY
          As a result the temporal sequencing
          was never activated.  Remember, he
          was supposed to replace you at
          nearly your current age.  He was
          engineered to skip thirty years of
          life.  But since the RNA sequencing
          was never activated, his cellular
          structure has started to break
          down.  He's dying.

                     PICARD
          Dying?

                     RIKER
          He wasn't designed to live a
          complete, human life span.

                     PlCARD
          Can anything be done for him?

                     BEVERLY
          Not without a complete
          myelodysplastic infusion from the
          only donor with compatible DNA.
          But that would mean draining all
          your blood.

                     RIKER
          That's why he went to all that
          trouble to capture you.

                     PlCARD
          How long does he have?

                     BEVERLY
          I can't be sure but the rate of
          decay seems to be accelerating.

Picard considers this.

                     PICARD
          Then he'll come for me as a donor.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Data stands before the B-9.

The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and
immobile.  Data gazes deeply into his double's identical
features.  Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a
small instrument to activate the android's head.

The B-9's eyes spring to life.  He looks at Data.

                     B-9
          Brother.  I cannot move.

                     DATA
          No, I have only activated your
          cognitive and communication
          subroutines.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          Because you are dangerous.

                     B-9
          Why?

                     DATA
          You have been programmed to gather
          information that can be used
          against this ship.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     DATA
          I know.

A beat.

                     DATA
          Do you know anything about
          Shinzon's plans against the
          Federation?

                     B-9
          No.

                     DATA
          Do you have any knowledge of the
          tactical abilities of his ship?

                     B-9
          No.  Can I move now?

                     DATA
          No.  I must deactivate you.

                     B-9
          For how long?

                     DATA
          Indefinitely.

                     B-9
          How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

                     DATA
          A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

                     GEORDI
          It's called a Cascading Biogenic
          Pulse.  The unique properties of
          Thalaron radiation allow the energy
          beam to expand almost without
          limits.  Depending on the radiant
          intensity it could encompass a
          ship... or a planet.

                     PICARD
               (thinking)
          And that's exactly what he's going
          to do.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          His hatred of the Federation is
          apparent.  He would have built a
          weapon of that scope for one
          reason.  He is going after Earth.

                     RIKER
          Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the
          Federation is crippled...

                     PICARD
          And the Romulans invade.

                     DEANNA
          How can you be certain?

                     PICARD
          I know how he thinks.

A beat.

                     RIKER
               (to Geordi)
          And there's no way to penetrate his
          cloak?

                     GEORDI
          No, sir.

                     RIKER
               (frustrated)
          He could pass within 10 meters of
          every ship in Starfleet and they'd
          never know.

                     BEVERLY
          But we do have one advantage.
               (to Picard)
          He needs your blood to live.  He
          might come after you first.

                     PICARD
          I'm counting on it... We've been
          ordered to head to sector 3274.
          Starfleet is diverting the fleet to
          meet us there.

                     RIKER
          Strength in numbers?

                     PICARD
          We can only hope so.

A beat as he looks at them gravely.

                     PICARD
          He can't be allowed to use that
          weapon.  All other concerns are
          secondary.  Do you understand me?

Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is
expendable.

                     RIKER
          Yes, sir.

Picard stands.  Presses a comm button.

                     PICARD
          All hands.  Battle stations.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES

We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle.

Crew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring
open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser
rifles.

Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field
around the warp core.

Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans...

Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on
Shinzon's ship.

Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with
apprehensive young ensign.

As we hear:

                     PICARD (V.O.)
          Captain's Personal Log.
          Supplemental.  We're heading toward
          Federation space at maximum warp.
          The crew has responded with the
          dedication I've come to expect of
          them.  And like a thousand other
          commanders on a thousand other
          battlefields throughout history, I
          wait for the dawn.

The montage ends as...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard enters sickbay.

Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They
position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies.
Security officers are handing out phasers.

Picard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him,
bolstering her phaser.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          To seek out new life and new
          civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's
          own words.  When Charles Darwin set
          out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his
          journey into the unknown... he
          sailed without a single musket.

                     BEVERLY
               (gently)
          That was another time.

                     PICARD
          How far we've come.  Let me know if
          you need anything.

He starts to go --

                     BEVERLY
          Jean Luc...
               (he stops)
          ... He is not you.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          What makes us who we are, Doctor?
          Can you tell me that?

She watches him go.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

                     SHINZON
          How long?

                     VICEROY
          A matter of hours now --

Shinzon shoves him away.  Stands.

                     VICEROY
          If you don't begin the procedure
          soon you'll never make it back to
          Romulus.  You shouldn't have
          delayed.  You should have killed
          Picard the moment --

Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.  The Viceroy watches
him carefully.

A beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.  He sits again in his
command chair.

                     SHINZON
          How long until we reach the Rift?

                     VICEROY
               (checks a console)
          Seven minutes.

Shinzon leans back, satisfied.  And looks at the viewscreen.

The image on the viewscreen is shocking.

The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise zooms through space.

Completely unaware of the predator directly above it.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ASTROMETRICS - NIGHT

Data is at work in Astrometry.  Cartographic projections of
star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard enters.

                     PICARD
          Show me our current position.

The images before them quickly change to show another sector
and a blip representing the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          How long until we reach the fleet?

                     DATA
          At our current velocity we will
          arrive at sector 3274 in
          approximately 40 minutes.

The images before them change to show sector 3274.  We see
blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a
moment.

                     PICARD
               (quietly)
          "For now we see but through a glass
          darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

                     DATA
          Of you?

                     PICARD
          Yes.

                     DATA
          I do not agree.  Although you share
          the same genetic structure, the
          events of your life have created
          unique individual.

                     PICARD
          But so much is the same.  On a
          biological level he is... and I
          will not accept the idea that there
          is nothing I can do.  I have a
          responsibility to try to make a
          human connection with him.

                     DATA
          He would deny a "human" connection
          is possible.  He considers himself
          entirely Reman.

                     PICARD
          He may have already rejected my
          humanity, but you also have a twin.

                     DATA
          No, sir, it is not possible.  The
          B-9 is physically identical to me,
          although his neural pathways are
          not as advanced.  But even if they
          were, he would not be me.

                     PICARD
          How can you be sure?

                     DATA
          I aspire, sir.  To be better than I
          am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does
          Shinzon.

A beat.

                     PICARD
          We'll never know what Shinzon might
          have been.  Had he stood where I
          did as a child?  And looked up at
          the stars.

Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.

Then the projections before them sputter with static for a
moment.  Flickering.

                     DATA
               (working controls)
          We are passing through the Bassen
          Rift.  The projections will return
          when we have cleared it.

                     PICARD
          It's interfering with our uplink
          from Starfleet cartography?

                     DATA
          Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all
          long-range communications --

                     PICARD
                (urgent, to comm)
          Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Too late.

The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise
is under attack!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through
space -- slamming into the Enterprise's warp drive.  The
Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a
furious lurch.

The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic
distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the
Enterprise before him.

                     SHINZON
          Target weapons systems and shields.
          I don't want the Enterprise
          destroyed.

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the
Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise.

                     SHINZON
          Can you learn to see in the dark,
          Captain?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship
ROCKS --

                     PICARD
          Report.

                     RIKER
          He's firing through his cloak.  We
          can't get a lock.

                     GEORDI
               (at engineering station)
          He disabled our warp drive with his
          first shot.  We've only got
          impulse.

                     WORF
          Long range communication is
          impossible as long as we're in the
          rift --

The ship SHUDDERS again --

                     PICARD
          Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,
          zero elevation.  All banks on my
          mark.  Scan for shield impacts and
          stand by photon torpedoes.

                     WORF
          Aye, sir

The ship ROCKS again.

                     PICARD
          Fire!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy
beams shoot into space --

And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of
its shields is hit.

Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but

were momentarily illuminated.

                chair console)
          Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the
Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a
brutal, close range assault --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--

                     DATA
          We are losing dorsal shields --

          Full axis rotation to port!  Fire
          all ventral phasers!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over
to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship
streaks above it --

A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise --
now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the
bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

          Unless we can disable his cloak
          we're just going to be firing in

          Agreed.

                     WORF
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

Shinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of
the Scimitar.

                     SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, will you join me in
          your Ready Room?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

Picard stands in his Ready Room.  A flickering light shimmers
across the room.  And a perfect holographic representation of
Shinzon appears before him.

                     SHINZON
          You can't trace my holographic
          emitters, Captain.  So don't
          bother.  And you can't contact
          Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

                     PICARD
          We are.

                     SHINZON
          It's just the two of us now, Jean
          Luc, as it should be... Your ship
          and mine... You and me.

                     PICARD
          Why are you here?

                     SHINZON
          To accept your surrender.  I can
          clearly destroy you at any time.
          Lower your shields and allow me to
          transport you to my ship.

                     PICARD
          And what of the Enterprise?

                     SHINZON
          I have little interest in your
          quaint vessel, Captain.  If the
          Enterprise will withdraw to a
          distance of one hundred light
          years, it will not be harmed.

                     PICARD
          You know that's not possible.

                     SHINZON
          I know... you'll all gladly die to
          save your home world.

                     PICARD
               (intense)
          Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel
          the blood pumping inside you?  Your
          hands, your eyes, your nature, are
          the same as mine.  Buried deep
          inside you beneath the years of
          pain and anger is a capacity you've
          forgotten.  It's the one way our
          mirror can reflect the two of us
          exactly because it's the very thing
          that truly defines us.  To be human
          is to try to make yourself better
          than you are.

Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.

                     PICARD
          I know you as well as I know
          myself, Shinzon.  There was a time
          you looked at the stars and dreamed
          of what might be.

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          Long ago.

                     PICARD
          Not so long.

                     SHINZON
          Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in
          the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm
          what you see now.

                     PICARD
          I see more than what you are.

Picard steps toward him.

                     PICARD
          I see what you could be.

Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward
him relentlessly.

                     PICARD
          The man who is Jean Luc Picard and
          Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate
          the population of an entire planet!
          He is better than that!

                     SHINZON
               (desperate)
          He is what his life has made him!

Shinzon is in turmoil.  Picard senses this.  He proceeds
quietly:

                     PICARD
          And what will he do with that life?

Shinzon looks at him, questioning.

                     PICARD
          If I were to beam to your ship...
          let you complete your medical
          procedure, give you a full life...
          what would you do with the time?

Shinzon doesn't respond.

                     PICARD
          You once asked me about your past.
          Your history.  When I was your age,
          I burned with ambition.  I was very
          proud and my pride often hurt
          people.  I made every wrong choice
          a young man can... But one thing
          saved me... I had a father who
          believed in me.  Who took the time
          to teach me a better way.  You have
          the same father.

                     SHINZON
          Yes.

                     PICARD
          So if I gave you my life, what
          would you do with it?  Would you
          spend the years in a blaze of
          hatred as you are now?  Or could
          you change?  Could you try to
          remember a mother's touch you never
          felt?  A father's words you never
          heard?  Could you do that?

                     SHINZON
               (quietly)
          I don't know.

                     PICARD
          But you want to.

Shinzon doesn't respond.  But Picard knows he has made a
connection.  For this brief moment reconciliation is
possible.  He proceeds quietly:

                     PICARD
          Let me tell you about our father.

Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.  What might have
been.

                     SHINZON
          That's your life... not mine.

                     PICARD
          Please.

                     SHINZON
          It's too late.

                     PICARD
          You can still make a choice!  Make
          the right one now!

                     SHINZON
          I have no choices!  I can't fight
          what I am!

Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:

                     SHINZON
          I'll show you my true nature.  Your
          nature.  And as Earth dies --
          remember that I'm forever Shinzon
          of Remus!  And my voice will echo
          through time long after yours has
          faded to a dim memory.

Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image
flickers and fades away.

Picard stands alone, drained.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his
Viceroy:

                     SHINZON
          Disable their weapons!

But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS
-- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned.

                     SHINZON
          Report!

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Two ships decloaking, sir!
          Romulan!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds
appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge.

                     RIKER
          Believe it or not, I think the
          cavalry has arrived.

                     WORF
          We're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen.

On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
          of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we
          be of assistance?

                     PICARD
          Your timing is impeccable,
          Commander.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          The Empire considers this a matter
          of internal security.  We regret
          you've become involved.

                     PICARD
          When this is over, I owe you a
          drink.

On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to
          work.  Valdore out.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (to Worf)
          You heard the lady.  Get to work.
          Move your ass!

(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons
and are visible throughout the battle.)

Although Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage
of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise
and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with
impacts.

                     PICARD

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair.

                     SHINZON
          Target the flanking Warbird.  All
          forward disruptor banks on my mark.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two
Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's
shields.

The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position,
firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded
as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor
beams criss-cross space.

Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her
forward disruptor banks fire at once --

They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge
EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY
off the Enterprise's forward shields -- !

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The ship ROCKS dangerously!

                     DATA
          Forward shields are down to ten

          Bring us about!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers,
as the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon's ship, firing --

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the
          aft port quadrant and prepare for
          full emergency stop.

                     VICEROY
               (startled)
          What?!

                     SHINZON
          You heard me.

INT.  VALDORE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at
viewscreen.  She sees part of the Scimitar's rear cloakning
fall away --

                     DONATRA
          She's losing her cloak!  Stand by
          all forward disruptor banks!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     VICEROY
          She's almost on us.

                     SHINZON
          Not yet.

On the viewscreen  we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining.
The Reman crew is getting nervous.

                     VICEROY
          Praetor...

                     SHINZON
          FULL STOP AND FIRE !

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop!  Too fast for the Valdore to
respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar --

And the Scimitar fires!

A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the
underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past --

The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
It floats dead in space.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     SHINZON
          Restore the aft cloak.and bring us
          about.

He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final
battle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on
viewscreen.  Her bridge is in ruins.

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          I'm afraid that drink will have to
          wait, Captain.

                     PICARD
          Do you have life support?

                     DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          For the moment.  But we're dead in
          the water.

                     PICARD
          Understood --

Then the ship ROCKS --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal
assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's
hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the Enterprise --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

                     DATA
          We have lost structural integrity
          on decks twelve through seventeen,

                     RIKER
          Evacuate those decks and reroute
          field power to forward shields.

Deanna goes to Picard:

                     DEANNA
          Captain -- I might have a way to
          find them.

                     PICARD
          Counselor?

                     DEANNA
          The one thing he may have forgotten
          in the course of battle: me.

                     PICARD
          Make it so.

She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console.

                     SHINZON
          Prepare a lateral run -- all
          starboard disruptors.

Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes --

                     VICEROY
          No!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with
Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo
targeting display.

It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts.

                     DEANNA
          He's resisting me.

She is in pain.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing
thoughts.

                     SHINZON
          What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

                     VICEROY
          She is here.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting
display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating
fiercely.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle.
Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him.

                     DEANNA
          Remember me?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Her eyes snap open --

                     DEANNA
          NOW!

Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space.

And connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the
Scimitar's cloak fails!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands quickly.

                     PICARD
          Savage them!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

And the Enterprise attacks!

It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon
torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds
quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the
darkness and debris litters the deck.

Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation.

                     SHINZON
               (spinning to his Viceroy)
          Prepare a boarding party -- BRING
          ME PICARD!

The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer.

                     SHINZON
          Get the cloak back!  And target
          shield coordinates beta three.  All
          disruptors.  Fire!

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny
part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge.

                     WORF
          Intruder alert!

                     RIKER
          Let's go.

Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as:

                     WORF
               (to comm)
          Security detail to deck twenty
          nine.

Data immediately assumes Worf's position at tactical.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - LOWER DECKS - NIGHT

Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the
cramped lower decks.

A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold!  The Viceroy and
his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the
corridor!

The Enterprise crew returns fire.  It is a blazing phaser
battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage.  They
steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor
fire --

They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy
escape into a Jefferies tube --

                     RIKER
          Worf.

Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and
sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady
burst from his phaser rifle.

Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him
into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man
who has been tormenting his wife --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling
the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon
torpedoes.

A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward
bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO
SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position --

Deanna races to assume the helm --

Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole
in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for
another attack run as part of the ship disappears --

                     GEORDI
          He's getting his cloak back.  We
          have exhausted our compliment of
          photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are
          down to four percent.

                     PICARD
          What if we target all phasers in a
          concentrated attack?

                     DATA
          The Scimitar's shields are still at
          seventy percent.  It would make no
          difference, sir.

Picard thinks.

                     DEANNA
          They're stopping...

Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly
turning.  Slowly advancing.  They see another part of the
Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning.

                     GEORDI
          What's he doing?

                     PICARD
               (grim)
          He wants to look me in the eye.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBE - FOLLOWING

Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine
series of access tunnels.  It is like a scene from ALIEN.

The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the
crippled ship make this an ominous sequence.  The Viceroy is
in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman
Homeworld, he can see in the dark.

Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
He stops, phaser ready.  He peers into the dark tunnel ahead
of him.  Sees nothing.  We tilt up and see...

The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker!
Hidden in the darkness.  The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down
on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the
darkness --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into
position.  Large parts of it are now cloaked.

It stops.  Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its
great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the
bridge.

Picard thinks, his mind racing.  Then it comes to him in a
flash:

                     PICARD
          He thinks he knows exactly what I'm
          going to do...

                     GEORDI
          Sir?

                     PICARD
          We've got him!

He sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering
command instructions in his chair console.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command
chair.

                     SHINZON
          Open a channel.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard is still entering commands in his chair console.

                     DATA
          We are being hailed.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, stand by.
               (to Data)
          Open a channel.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          I hope you're still alive, Jean
          Luc.

                     PICARD
          I am.

                     SHINZON (V.O.)
          Don't you think it's time to
          surrender?  I'll have my cloak back
          in a matter of minutes and your
          poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why
          should the rest of your crew have
          to die?

Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to
Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of
this as Picard buys some time:

                     PICARD
          I never told you about my first
          Academy evaluation, did I?  I
          received very high marks for my
          studies.  But I was found lacking
          in certain other areas.
          Personality traits, you might say.
          In particular I was thought to be
          extremely...
               (he glares up at the prow
                of the Scimitar)
          ... over-confident.

Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then:

                     PICARD
               (quickly)
          Geordi, put 211 power to the
          engines.  Take it from life support
          if you have to -- everything you
          can give me.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

                     PICARD
          Deanna, on my mark.

                     GEORDI
          Ready, sir!

Picard leans forward in his chair:

                     PICARD
               (on comm)
          All hands, brace for impact!
               (to Deanna)
          ENGAGE.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- !

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up --

                     SHINZON
          HARD TO PORT !

Too late.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar
-- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship --

The Scimitar REELS --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Everyone goes FLYING!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating
in space.

The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in
Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his
bridge crew are now dead.

                     SHINZON
          Divert all power to engines.  Full
          reverse!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the
Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a
deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar
is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING

The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear
itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the
collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the
relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs --

Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is
momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both
tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall!

Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy,
grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a
long drop below them!

Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a
brutal struggle --

Riker glares at him.

                     RIKER
          Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

                     PICARD
          Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

                     PICARD
          Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
          Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize
          voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.
          Authorization Alpha Alpha Three
          Zero Five --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

                     SHINZON
          Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

                     SHINZON
          Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
          on that ship.  Then set a course
          for Earth.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          What about Picard?

                     SHINZON
          Our greater goal is more important,
          brother.

                     REMAN OFFICER
          But, Praetor, you won't survive
          without him...

Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen.

                     SHINZON
          Some ideals are worth dying for,
          aren't they, Jean Luc?

EXT.  RIFT - SPACE

The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic
version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan
Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
The Cascading Pulse.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse
weapon slowly deploying.

                     PICARD
          How long until he can fire?

                     GEORDI
          The targeting sequence should take
          about four minutes.

                     DEANNA
          But how can he?  He'll kill you.

                     PICARD
          This isn't about me anymore.

Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do.
Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as...

                     PICARD
          Prepare for a site-to-site
          transport.

                     GEORDI
               (concerned)
          Sir, we won't be able to bring you
          back.  It's a one way trip.
          Captain, I don't know if the
          transporter --

                     PICARD
          That's an order, Commander.

                     DATA
          Sir, allow me to go.  You are
          needed here.

                     PICARD
          Negative.

                     DATA
          Sir...

Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is
something Picard must do himself.

                     DEANNA
          Let him go.

Picard powers up the phaser rifle as:

                     PICARD
               (to Data)
          You have the bridge, Commander.
          Use all available power to move
          away from the Scimitar.
               (to Geordi)
          Now, Mister La Forge.

                     GEORDI
          Aye, sir.

Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and
Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes
in a shower of sparks.

                     GEORDI
          That's it.  Transporters are down.

Data thinks for a moment.  Then:

                     DATA
          Counsellor Troi, please assume
          command.  Geordi, if you will come
          with me.

He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker
returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his
phaser rifle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the
corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in
place at the end of the corridor.

Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers
on around him.

Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.

                     DATA
          What is our approximate distance?

                     GEORDI
               (scans with tricorder)
          400 meters.

                     DATA
          Thank you.

Data backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again.
Deeply.

                     DATA
          Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the
          field.

Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end
of the corridor snaps off --

The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running
start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

-- into space.

He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him.
Carrying him too far!

He is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He
thrusts out a hand --

And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is
floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS
into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship!

He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls
himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with
his superior strength and climbs inside.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the
viewscreen.

We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is
locked on the Enterprise.

Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the
three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through
the floor.

                     COMPUTER (V.O)
          Forty-seven.  Forty six...

Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge
explode in.  Shinzon spins to see --

Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.

Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but
Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in
the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned.

The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing
disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with
his phaser rifle --

He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor
blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins
away --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor
from a fallen comrade --

As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long
metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear --

Impaling Shinzon.

A stunned moment of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard,
almost with a look of disbelief.  Blood spews from his mouth
as he lets out a tormented cry.

And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward --
pushing Picard back against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks
toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear
-- the spear point explodes through Shinzon's back -- the
weight of Shinzon's body is pinning Picard against the wall
-- time is running out --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Eighteen... Seventeen...

Shinzon forces himself down the spear:

                     SHINZON
          I'm glad we're together now -- our
          destiny is complete.

He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps
his dying hands firmly around Picard's throat --

                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Ten...Nine...

Data sprints to the bridge --

He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small,
silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --
he slaps it on Picard's shoulder.  A final look between
them --
                     COMPUTER (V.O.)
          Seven..  Six...

Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes.

Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply:

                     DATA
          Goodbye.

Then he spins and pulls out his phaser --

And fires point-blank into the Scimitar's warp core relays --
the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard re-materializes.

He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the
gaping hole in the front of the bridge.

Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.  Geordi stands
on the upper rear deck, head down.

A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the
thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes.

Riker emerges from the turbolift.  Goes to Picard.

                     RIKER
          Sir?

Picard doesn't answer, he just stares forward.  Deanna goes
to Riker.

                     DEANNA
          Data.

Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance.
He puts an arm around Deanna.

Silence.

                     GEORDI
          Sir, we're being hailed.

                     PICARD
          On screen...
               (he remembers there is no
                longer a viewscreen)
          ... Open a channel.

                     DONATRA (V.O.)
          This is Commander Donatra of the
          Valdore.  We're dispatching
          shuttles with medical personnel and
          supplies.

                     PICARD
          Thank you, Commander.

The transmission ends.

                     PICARD
               (flat)
          Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
          for arrivals.  They don't know our
          procedures so just... open the
          doors.

                     GEORDI
          I'll take care of it, sir.

                     PICARD
          Number One.
               (a beat)
          You have the bridge.

He turns and heads toward his Ready Room.

The others watch him go with great sadness.

When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally
allows herself to cry.  Riker holds her closely.  Slow fade
to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Hours later.  The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the
shattered remains of the crew lounge.  Picard, Riker, Deanna,
Beverly, Worf, Geordi.

They wear their dress uniforms.

Picard goes to each of them.  He carries a small, metal box.
They each take something from the box.

At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we
realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their
uniforms.

Mourning bands.

Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard.
Each takes a glass.

Picard raises his glass.

                     PICARD
          To absent friends... o family.

They toast Data.  Slow fade to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do
not see.

                     PICARD
          I don't know if all this has made
          sense to you, but I wanted you to
          know what kind of man he was.  In
          his quest to be more like us, he
          helped show us what it means to be
          human.

We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from
him.

                     B-9
          My brother was not a human.

                     PICARD
          No, he wasn't... But his wonder and
          his curiosity about every facet of
          human life helped all of us see the
          best parts of ourselves.  He
          embraced change... because he
          always wanted to be more than he
          was.

                     B-9
          I do not understand.

                     PICARD
          Well, I hope someday you will.

Worf interrupts on comm:

                     WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
          Captain, the Hemingway has arrived
          to tow us to spacedock.

                     PICARD
          On my way.  Please notify Commander
          Riker...
               (he stands, prepares to
                go)
          ... We'll talk later?

The B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at
the padd on Picard's desk.

Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He
turns back to the B-9.

The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's
humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very
softly...

                     B-9
          "Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
          but blue skies do I see."

Then the B-9 is silent.

Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over
his features, and then goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way
past the debris littering the corridor.

                     PICARD
          I'm sorry you won't be here for the
          re-fit, but I know the Titan needs
          you immediately.

Riker does not respond.

Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply.

                     PICARD
          The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And
          she's getting a captain worthy of
          her.

                     RIKER
          She's the most beautiful ship I've
          ever seen.
               (he touches a wall of the
                corridor)
          ... But she's not the Enterprise.

                     PICARD
          I promise you in time, she'll
          become your home... If I could
          offer you one piece of advice?

                     RIKER
          Anything.

                     PICARD
          When your first officer insists
          that you can't go on away
          missions... Ignore him --

                     RIKER
               (smiles)
          I intend to.

A moment.

                     RIKER
               (with difficulty)
          Serving with you has been an honor.

                     PICARD
          The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH

A few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great
womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces
nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself
before entering.

Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around
the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young
officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering
station.  We also see new command chairs being installed.

(Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at
the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.)

A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at
Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in
amusement.  He sees her.

                     MADDEN
          So... what's the old man like?

                     OPS OFFICER
          Why don't you go in and find out?

Commander Madden prepares himself.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING

Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her
new office at Starfleet Medical.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.
          They're kids!  All with advance
          degrees in xenobiology and out to
          conquer every disease in the
          quadrant.

                     PICARD
               (smiles)
          Reminds me of a young doctor I used
          to know...

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          They're running me ragged.  Nothing
          but questions day and night... I
          love it!  Come to dinner and I'll
          tell you all about it.  There's a
          Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

                     PICARD
          Not tonight, I have work here.

                     BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
          Soon then.  I'll save the last
          dance for you.

Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door
chime so Picard is surprised.

                     MADDEN
          Commander Martin Madden reporting
          for duty, sir.

Picard stands, they shake hands as:

                     PICARD
          Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,
          your transfer didn't come as too
          much of a surprise.

                     MADDEN
          I was... honored, sir.

                     PICARD
          I needed you immediately to help
          oversee the re-fit...
               (gathering up some padds
                from his desk)
          ... Your service record on the
          Talos is exemplary, but there are a
          few things I would like to discuss
          with you regarding my requirements
          for a First Officer.  Shall we say
          dinner in my quarters at 1900
          hours?

                     MADDEN
          Very good, sir.

Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.

                     PICARD
          Commander, I don't know how they
          did it on the Talos, but we have
          door chimes on the Enterprise.  We
          use them.

                     MADDEN
          Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky
young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command
chair.

                     WORF
          You don't understand the Captain --
          there should be no changes until we
          have discussed the modifications
          with him.

Picard goes to them:

                     PICARD
          What's this?

                     WORF
               (grumbles)
          Your new chair, sir.

                     ENSIGN
          It's the Mark Seven, Captain.
          State-of-the-art ergonomics...
          command interfaces with --

                     WORF
          I told him you're comfortable with
          your old chair.

                     PICARD
          Let's give it a try.

He settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a
beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new
generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles.

                     PICARD
          Feels good.

Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.

                     ENSIGN
               (points)
          Try that button, sir.

Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal
restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders.
Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised.

A beat.

Then Picard smiles.

                     PICARD
          It's about time.

He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into
the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden:

                     PICARD
          Commander, please sit down...

Madden sits in the First Officer's chair, Picard shares a
padd with him.

                     PICARD
          ... We've received our first
          assignment.  We're going to be
          exploring the Denab system.  It
          should be exciting.  It's a
          place... where no one has gone
          before.

And we cut to --

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH - FOLLOWING

Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden.
Picard at work, at peace.  Where he is meant to be.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.  As we
hear the B-9's soft tones.  Gentle.  Hopeful.

                     B-9 (V.O.)
          "Never saw the sun shining so
          bright, Never saw things going so
          right.  Noticing the days hurrying
          by, When you're in love, my how
          they fly.  Blue days, all of them
          gone, Nothing but blue skies from
          now on."

We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the
stars.  Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing
"Next Generation" theme explodes over END CREDITS.

                                                FADE OUT.

               A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
               War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
               into infinity.

                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
               surface of an Art Deco design.

               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Did you hear that? They've shut down 
                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed 
                         for sure. This is madness!

               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in 
               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed!

               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that 
               only another robot could understand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         There'll be no escape for the Princess 
                         this time.

               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as 
               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment 
               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What's that?

               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE

               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade 
               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the 
               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a 
               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and 
               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make 
               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with 
               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns 
               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck 
               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers 
               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered 
               arms and faces.

               An explosion hits near the robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I should have known better than to 
                         trust the logic of a half-sized 
                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages 
               around the two hapless robots.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY

               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. 
               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone 
               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations 
               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy 
               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable 
               lad with a prize-winning smile.

               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a 
               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the 
               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided 
               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot 
               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  
               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and 
               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his 
               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying 
               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired 
               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet 
               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the 
               tiny robot to follow him.

                                     LUKE
                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you 
                         waiting for?! Get in gear!

               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and 
               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his 
               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps 
               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum 
               madly.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY

               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his 
               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is 
               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured 
               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which 
               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the 
               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away 
               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through 
               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run 
               in a frenzied panic.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  
               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is 
               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel 
               soldiers can be heard in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and 
               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years 
               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, 
               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting 
               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little 
               robot joins his companion.

                                     THREEPIO
                         At last! Where have you been?

               Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're heading in this direction. 
                         What are we going to do? We'll be 
                         sent to the spice mine of Kessel or 
                         smashed into who knows what!

               Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the 
               subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait a minute, where are you going?

               Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

               The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies 
               of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as 
               an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

                                     IMPERIAL OFFICER
                         The Death Star plans are not in the 
                         main computer.

               Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles 
               in vain.

                                     VADER
                         Where are those transmissions you 
                         intercepted?

               Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

                                     VADER
                         What have you done with those plans?

                                     REBEL OFFICER
                         We intercepted no transmissions. 
                         Aaah... This is a consular ship. 
                         Were on a diplomatic mission.

                                     VADER
                         If this is a consular ship... were 
                         is the Ambassador?

               The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the 
               Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a 
               gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. 
               Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to 
               his troops.

                                     VADER
                         Commander, tear this ship apart until 
                         you've found those plans and bring 
                         me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

               The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the 
               stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia 
               Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her 
               eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds 
               of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the 
               troopers spots her.

                                     TROOPER
                         There she is! Set for stun!

               Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with 
               her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a 
               paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

                                     TROOPER
                         She'll be all right. Inform Lord 
                         Vader we have a prisoner.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

               Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. 
               He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light 
               begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into 
               the cramped four-man pod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hey, you're not permitted in there. 
                         It's restricted. You'll be deactivated 
                         for sure..

               Artoo beeps something to him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't call me a mindless philosopher, 
                         you overweight glob of grease! Now 
                         come out before somebody sees you.

               Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding 
               the mission he is about to perform.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Secret mission? What plans? What are 
                         you talking about? I'm not getting 
                         in there!

               Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps 
               and twangs angrily.

               A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris 
               through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, 
               after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky 
               robot jumps into the lifepod.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm going to regret this.

               INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER

               On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified 
               robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

                                     CHIEF PILOT
                         There goes another one.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Hold your fire. There are no life 
                         forms. It must have been short-
                         circuited.

               INT. LIFEPOD

               Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  
               Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's funny, the damage doesn't 
                         look as bad from out here.

               Artoo beeps an assuring response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Are you sure this things safe?

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white 
               buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty 
               empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to 
               get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist 
               at Luke as he flies past.

                                     WOMAN
                         I've told you kids to slow down!

               INT. POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged 
               mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been 
               asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the 
               office, yelling wildly.

                                     FIXER
                         Did I hear a young noise blast through 
                         here?

                                     CAMIE
                         It was just wormie on another rampage.

               Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak 
               and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are 
               playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, 
               handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy 
               city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics 
               of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the 
               background.

                                     LUKE
                         Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?

               Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great 
               joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't know you were back! When 
                         did you get in?

                                     BIGGS
                         Just now. I wanted to surprise you, 
                         hot shot. I thought you'd be here... 
                         certainly didn't expect you to be 
                         out working.
                              (he laughs)

                                     LUKE
                         The Academy didn't change you 
                         much...but you're back so soon? Hey, 
                         what happened, didn't you get your 
                         commission?

               Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

                                     BIGGS
                         Of course I got it. Signed aboard 
                         The Rand Ecliptic last week. First 
                         mate Biggs Darklighter at your 
                         service...
                              (he salutes)
                         ...I just came to say good-bye to 
                         all you unfortunate landlocked 
                         simpletons.

               Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend 
               is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of 
               it.

                                     LUKE
                         I almost forgot. There's a battle 
                         going on! Right here in our system. 
                         Come and look!

                                     DEAK
                         Not again! Forget it.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - 
               DAY

               The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie 
               and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. 
               Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

                                     LUKE
                         There they are!

               Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to 
               see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars 
               Biggs sees two small silver specks.

                                     BIGGS
                         That's no battle, hot shot... they're 
                         just sitting there! Probably a 
                         freighter-tanker refueling.

                                     LUKE
                         But there was a lot of firing 
                         earlier...

               Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the 
               building in the process. Luke grabs them.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, easy with those...

                                     CAMIE
                         Don't worry about it, Wormie.

               The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs 
               his shoulders in resignation.

                                     FIXER
                         I keep telling you, the Rebellion is 
                         a long way from here. I doubt if the 
                         Empire would even fight to keep this 
                         system. Believe me Luke, this planet 
                         is a big hunk of nothing...

               Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The 
               group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about 
               Luke's ineptitude.

               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY

               Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad 
               of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is 
               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly 
               marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader 
               emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard 
               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

                                     LEIA
                         Lord Vader, I should have known. 
                         Only you could be so bold. The 
                         Imperial Senate will not sit for 
                         this, when they hear you've attacked 
                         a diplomatic...

                                     VADER
                         Don't play games with me, Your 
                         Highness. You weren't on any mercy 
                         mission this time. You passed directly 
                         through a restricted system. Several 
                         transmissions were beamed to this 
                         ship by Rebel spies. I want to know 
                         what happened to the plans they sent 
                         you.

                                     LEIA
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. I'm a member of the Imperial 
                         Senate on a diplomatic mission to 
                         Alderaan...

                                     VADER
                         You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... 
                         and a traitor. Take her away!

               Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering 
               hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander 
               turns to Vader.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Holding her is dangerous. If word of 
                         this gets out, it could generate 
                         sympathy for the Rebellion in the 
                         senate.

                                     VADER
                         I have traced the Rebel spies to 
                         her. Now she is my only link to find 
                         their secret base!

                                     COMMANDER
                         She'll die before she tells you 
                         anything.

                                     VADER
                         Leave that to me. Send a distress 
                         signal and then inform the senate 
                         that all aboard were killed!

               Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. 
               They stop and snap to attention.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Lord Vader, the battle station plans 
                         are not aboard this ship! And no 
                         transmissions were made. An escape 
                         pod was jettisoned during the 
                         fighting, but no life forms were 
                         aboard.

               Vader turns to the Commander.

                                     VADER
                         She must have hidden the plans in 
                         the escape pod. Send a detachment 
                         down to retrieve them. See to it 
                         personally, Commander. There'll be 
                         no one to stop us this time.

                                     COMMANDER
                         Yes, sir.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the 
               planet Tatooine.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT

               Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas 
               meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids 
               kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily 
               work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in 
               the distance rests half buried in the sand.

                                     THREEPIO
                         How did I get into this mess? I really 
                         don't know how. We seem to be made 
                         to suffer. It's our lot in life.

               Artoo answers with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I've got to rest before I fall apart. 
                         My joints are almost frozen.

               Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What a desolate place this is.

               Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts 
               off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio 
               stops and yells at him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where are you going?

               A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small 
               robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Well, I'm not going that way. It's 
                         much too rocky. This way is much 
                         easier.

               Artoo counters with a long whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What makes you think there are 
                         settlements over there?

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't get technical with me.

               Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What mission? What are you talking 
                         about? I've had just about enough of 
                         you! Go that way! You'll be 
                         malfunctioning within a day, you 
                         nearsighted scrap pile!

               Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the 
               direction of the vast dune sea.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And don't let me catch you following 
                         me begging for help, because you 
                         won't get it.

               Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges 
               off in the direction of the towering mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No more adventures. I'm not going 
                         that way.

               Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant 
               mountains.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA

               Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a 
               dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless 
               miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant 
               rock mesas.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That malfunctioning little twerp. 
                         This is all his fault! He tricked me 
                         into going this way, but he'll do no 
                         better.

               In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand 
               from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of 
               reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving 
               towards him.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm 
                         saved!

               The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the 
               approaching transport.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Over here! Help! Please, help!

               EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

               Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer 
               and the others can be heard working inside.

                                     LUKE
                              (Very animated)
                         ...so I cut off my power, shut down 
                         the afterburners and came in low on 
                         Deak's trail. I was so close I thought 
                         I was going to fry my instruments. 
                         As it was I busted up the Skyhopper 
                         pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty 
                         upset. He grounded me for the rest 
                         of the season. You should have been 
                         there... it was fantastic.

                                     BIGGS
                         You ought to take it easy Luke. You 
                         may be the hottest bushpilot this 
                         side of Mos Eisley, but those little 
                         Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it 
                         up, and one day, whammo, you're going 
                         to be nothing more than a dark spot 
                         on the down side of a canyon wall.

                                     LUKE
                         Look who's talking. Now that you've 
                         been around those giant starships 
                         you're beginning to sound like my 
                         uncle. You've gotten soft in the 
                         city...

                                     BIGGS
                         I've missed you kid.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, things haven't been the same 
                         since you left, Biggs. It's been 
                         so... quiet.

               Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke, I didn't come back just to say 
                         good-bye... I shouldn't tell you 
                         this, but you're the only one I can 
                         trust... and if I don't come back, I 
                         want somebody to know.

               Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BIGGS
                         I made some friends at the Academy.
                              (he whispers)
                         ...when our frigate goes to one of 
                         the central systems, we're going to 
                         jump ship and join the Alliance...

               Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

                                     LUKE
                         Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! 
                         How?

                                     BIGGS
                         Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth 
                         bigger than a meteor crater!

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
                              (he whispers)
                         Listen how quiet I am. You can barely 
                         hear me...

               Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

                                     BIGGS
                         My friend has a friend on Bestine 
                         who might help us make contact.

                                     LUKE
                         You're crazy! You could wander around 
                         forever trying to find them.

                                     BIGGS
                         I know it's a long shot, but if I 
                         don't find them I'll do what I can 
                         on my own... It's what we always 
                         talked about. Luke, I'm not going to 
                         wait for the Empire to draft me into 
                         service. The Rebellion is spreading 
                         and I want to be on the right side -- 
                         the side I believe in.

                                     LUKE
                         And I'm stuck here...

                                     BIGGS
                         I thought you were going to the 
                         Academy next term. You'll get your 
                         chance to get off this rock.

                                     LUKE
                         Not likely! I had to cancel my 
                         application. There has been a lot of 
                         unrest among the Sandpeople since 
                         you left... they've even raided the 
                         outskirts of Anchorhead.

                                     BIGGS
                         Your uncle could hold off a whole 
                         colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.

                                     LUKE
                         I know, but he's got enough vaporators 
                         going to make the place pay off. He 
                         needs me for just one more season. I 
                         can't leave him now.

                                     BIGGS
                         I feel for you, Luke, you're going 
                         to have to learn what seems to be 
                         important or what really is important. 
                         What good is all your uncle's work 
                         if it's taken over by the Empire?... 
                         You know they're starting to 
                         nationalize commerce in the central 
                         systems... it won't be long before 
                         your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving 
                         for the greater glory of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         It couldn't happen here. You said it 
                         yourself. The Empire won't bother 
                         with this rock.

                                     BIGGS
                         Things always change.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I was going... Are you going 
                         to be around long?

                                     BIGGS
                         No, I'm leaving in the morning...

                                     LUKE
                         Then I guess I won't see you.

                                     BIGGS
                         Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I'll be at the Academy next 
                         season... after that who knows. I 
                         won't be drafted into the Imperial 
                         Starfleet that's for sure... Take 
                         care of yourself, you'll always be 
                         the best friend I've got.

                                     BIGGS
                         So long, Luke.

               Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the 
               power station.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET

               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange 
               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures 
               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock 
               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he 
               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for 
               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.

               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall 
               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little 
               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a 
               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the 
               narrow path.

               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until 
               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out 
               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages 
               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his 
               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then 
               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller 
               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they 
               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and 
               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be 
               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave 
               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down 
               the trail.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a 
               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a 
               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot 
               is sucked into the giant machine.

               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders 
               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA

               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo 
               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles 
               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty 
               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and 
               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper 
               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end 
               of the chamber.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA

               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the 
               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various 
               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, 
               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls 
               out from the gloom.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent 
               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain 
               ridge.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY

               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. 
               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks 
                         go off in this direction.

               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand 
               and gives it to the first trooper.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Look, sir -- droids.

               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES

               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

               INT. SANDCRAWLER

               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped 
               prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Wake up! Wake up!

               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, 
               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  
               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights 
               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long 
               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding 
               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the 
               odd assortment of robots.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We're doomed.

               A Jawa starts moving toward them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Do you think they'll melt us down?

               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this 
                         never end?

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON

               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their 
               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of 
               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small 
               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground 
               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small 
               adobe block house.

               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening 
               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. 
               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting 
               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils 
               should be.

               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, 
               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are 
               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully 
               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- 
               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little 
               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales 
               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the 
               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru 
               standing in the main courtyard.

                                     BERU
                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a 
                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like we don't have much of 
                         a choice but I'll remind him.

               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment 
               for sale with the Jawa leader.

                                     OWEN
                         I have no need for a protocol droid.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (quickly)
                         Sir -- not in an environment such as 
                         this -- that's why I've also been 
                         programmed for over thirty secondary 
                         functions that...

                                     OWEN
                         What I really need is a droid that 
                         understands the binary language of 
                         moisture vaporators.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was 
                         programming binary load lifter... 
                         very similar to your vaporators. You 
                         could say...

                                     OWEN
                         Do you speak Bocce?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Of course I can, sir. It's like a 
                         second language for me... I'm as 
                         fluent in Bocce...

                                     OWEN
                         All right shut up!
                              (turning to Jawa)
                         I'll take this one.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Shutting up, sir.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, take these two over to the 
                         garage, will you? I want you to have 
                         both of them cleaned up before dinner.

                                     LUKE
                         But I was going into Toshi Station 
                         to pick up some power converters...

                                     OWEN
                         You can waste time with your friends 
                         when your chores are done. Now come 
                         on, get to it!

                                     LUKE
                         All right, come on! And the red one, 
                         come on. Well, come on, Red, let's 
                         go.

               As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back 
               into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep 
               and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained 
               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two 
               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the 
               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. 
                         Look!

                                     OWEN
                              (to the head Jawa)
                         Hey, what're you trying to push on 
                         us?

               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked 
               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract 
               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps 
               Luke on the shoulder.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (pointing to Artoo)
                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is 
                         in prime condition. A real bargain.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen...

                                     OWEN
                         Yeah?

                                     LUKE
                         What about that one?

                                     OWEN
                              (to Jawa)
                         What about that blue one? We'll take 
                         that one.

               With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged 
               astro-droid for Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, take it away.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very 
                         pleased with that one, sir. He really 
                         is in first-class condition. I've 
                         worked with him before. Here he comes.

               Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots 
               trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay, let's go.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Now, don't you forget this! Why I 
                         should stick my neck out for you is 
                         quite beyond my capacity!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful 
               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers 
               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the 
               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery 
               with a cord to his face.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Thank the maker! This oil bath is 
                         going to feel so good. I've got such 
                         a bad case of dust contamination, I 
                         can barely move!

               Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought 
               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man 
               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. 
               Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he 
               slams a wrench across the workbench.

                                     LUKE
                         It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is 
                         right. I'm never gonna get out of 
                         here!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Is there anything I might do to help?

               Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains 
               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, not unless you can alter time, 
                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me 
                         off this rock!

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think so, sir. I'm only a 
                         droid and not very knowledgeable 
                         about such things. Not on this planet, 
                         anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm 
                         not even sure which planet I'm on.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, if there's a bright center to 
                         the universe, you're on the planet 
                         that it's farthest from.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Uh, you can call me Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see, sir Luke.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Just Luke.

                                     THREEPIO
                         And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg 
                         relations, and this is my counterpart, 
                         Artoo-Detoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hello.

               Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to 
               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome 
               pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping 
               oil from his bronze body.

                                     LUKE
                         You got a lot of carbon scoring here. 
                         It looks like you boys have seen a 
                         lot of action.

                                     THREEPIO
                         With all we've been through, sometimes 
                         I'm amazed we're in as good condition 
                         as we are, what with the Rebellion 
                         and all.

                                     LUKE
                         You know of the Rebellion against 
                         the Empire?

                                     THREEPIO
                         That's how we came to be in your 
                         service, if you take my meaning, 
                         sir.

                                     LUKE
                         Have you been in many battles?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Several, I think. Actually, there's 
                         not much to tell. I'm not much more 
                         than an interpreter, and not very 
                         good at telling stories. Well, not 
                         at making them interesting, anyways.

               Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's 
               neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, my little friend, you've got 
                         something jammed in here real good. 
                         Were you on a cruiser or...

               The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling 
               head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being 
               projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a 
               rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly 
               lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                         only hope.

                                     LUKE
                         What's this?

               Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio 
               to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment 
               over and over.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What is what?!? He asked you a 
                         question...
                              (pointing to Leia)
                         What is that?

               Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice 
               the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer 
               for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the 
               sentence fragment over and over.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
                         only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
                         You're my only hope.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely 
                         a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no 
                         mind.

               Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

                                     LUKE
                         Who is she? She's beautiful.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

                                     LEIA
                         Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

                                     THREEPIO
                         I think she was a passenger on our 
                         last voyage. A person of some 
                         importance, sir -- I believe. Our 
                         captain was attached to...

                                     LUKE
                         Is there more to this recording?

               Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic 
               squeaks and a whistle.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going 
                         to get us in trouble. It's all right, 
                         you can trust him. He's our new 
                         master.

               Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's the property of Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi, a resident of these parts. 
                         And it's a private message for him. 
                         Quite frankly, sir I don't know what 
                         he's talking about. Our last master 
                         was Captain Antilles, but with what 
                         we've been through, this little R2 
                         unit has become a bit eccentric.

                                     LUKE
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means 
                         old Ben Kenobi?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I beg your pardon, sir, but do you 
                         know what he's talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
                         Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond 
                         the dune sea. He's kind of a strange 
                         old hermit.

               Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few 
               moments.

                                     LUKE
                         I wonder who she is. It sounds like 
                         she's in trouble. I'd better play 
                         back the whole thing.

               Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says the restraining bolt has 
                         short circuited his recording system. 
                         He suggests that if you remove the 
                         bolt, he might be able to play back 
                         the entire recording.

               Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't 
               really heard what Threepio has been saying.

                                     LUKE
                         H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're 
                         too small to run away on me if I 
                         take this off! Okay.

               Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off 
               Artoo's side.

                                     LUKE
                         There you go.

               The princess immediately disappears...

                                     LUKE
                         Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? 
                         Bring her back! Play back the entire 
                         message.

               Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in 
               embarrassment.

                                     THREEPIO
                         What message? The one you're carrying 
                         inside your rusty innards!

               A women's voice calls out from another room.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

               Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning 
               robot.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be right there, Aunt 
                         Beru.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to 
                         have picked up a slight flutter.

               Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and 
               hurries out of the room.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, see what you can do with him. 
                         I'll be right back.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Just you reconsider playing that 
                         message for him.

               Artoo beeps in response.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't think he likes you at 
                         all.

               Artoo beeps.

                                     THREEPIO
                         No, I don't like you either.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA

               Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher 
               with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
               used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls 
               of food and starts for the dining area.

               Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with 
               steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red 
               grain.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, I think that R2 unit we 
                         bought might have been stolen.

                                     OWEN
                         What makes you think that?

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I stumbled across a recording 
                         while I was cleaning him. He says he 
                         belongs to someone called Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi.

               Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but 
               manages to control himself.

                                     LUKE
                         I thought he might have meant old 
                         Ben. Do you know what he's talking 
                         about? Well, I wonder if he's related 
                         to Ben.

               Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

                                     OWEN
                         That old man's just a crazy old 
                         wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take 
                         that R2 unit into Anchorhead and 
                         have its memory flushed. That'll be 
                         the end of it. It belongs to us now.

                                     LUKE
                         But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking 
                         for him?

                                     OWEN
                         He won't, I don't think he exists 
                         any more. He died about the same 
                         time as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         He knew my father?

                                     OWEN
                         I told you to forget it. Your only 
                         concern is to prepare the new droids 
                         for tomorrow. In the morning I want 
                         them on the south ridge working out 
                         those condensers.

                                     LUKE
                         Yes, sir. I think those new droids 
                         are going to work out fine. In fact, 
                         I, uh, was also thinking about our 
                         agreement about my staying on another 
                         season. And if these new droids do 
                         work out, I want to transmit my 
                         application to the Academy this year.

               Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress 
               it.

                                     OWEN
                         You mean the next semester before 
                         harvest?

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, there're more than enough 
                         droids.

                                     OWEN
                         Harvest is when I need you the most. 
                         Only one more season. This year we'll 
                         make enough on the harvest so I'll 
                         be able to hire some more hands. And 
                         then you can go to the Academy next 
                         year.

               Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.

                                     OWEN
                         You must understand I need you here, 
                         Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         But it's a whole 'nother year.

                                     OWEN
                         Look, it's only one more season.

               Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

                                     LUKE
                         Yeah, that's what you said last year 
                         when Biggs and Tank left.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Where are you going?

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like I'm going nowhere. I 
                         have to finish cleaning those droids.

               Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen 
               mechanically finishes his dinner.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Owen, he can't stay here forever. 
                         Most of his friends have gone. It 
                         means so much to him.

                                     OWEN
                         I'll make it up to him next year. I 
                         promise.

                                     AUNT BERU
                         Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He 
                         has too much of his father in him.

                                     OWEN
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a 
               distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few 
               moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the 
               homestead.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE

               Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in 
               sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt 
               similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the 
               box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a 
               short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.

                                     LUKE
                         What are you doing hiding there?

               Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in 
               sight.

                                     THREEPIO
                         It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't 
                         deactivate me. I told him not to go, 
                         but he's faulty, malfunctioning; 
                         kept babbling on about his mission.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no!

               Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead 
               and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
               robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the 
               salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his 
               electrobinoculars.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That R2 unit has always been a 
                         problem. These astro-droids are 
                         getting quite out of hand. Even I 
                         can't understand their logic at times.

                                     LUKE
                         How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere 
                         in sight. Blast it!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go 
                         after him?

                                     LUKE
                         It's too dangerous with all the 
                         Sandpeople around. We'll have to 
                         wait until morning.

               Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke, I'm shutting the power down 
                         for the night.

                                     LUKE
                         All right, I'll be there in a few 
                         minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

               He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

                                     LUKE
                         You know that little droid is going 
                         to cause me a lot of trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, he excels at that, sir.

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA

               Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of 
               the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of 
               Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

                                     OWEN
                         Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be 
                         loafing now!

               INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN

               The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru 
               prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

                                     OWEN
                         Have you seen Luke this morning?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         He said he had some things to do 
                         before he started today, so he left 
                         early.

                                     OWEN
                         Uh? Did he take those two new droids 
                         with him?

                                     AUNT BERU
                         I think so.

                                     OWEN
                         Well, he'd better have those units 
                         in the south range repaired be midday 
                         or there'll be hell to pay!

               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY

               The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio 
               pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast 
               wasteland.

               INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - 
               DAY

               Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something 
               in the motor compartment.

                                     LUKE
                              (yelling)
                         How's that.

               Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the 
               wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

                                     LUKE
                         Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this 
                         direction somewhere, but I don't see 
                         how that R2 unit could have come 
                         this far. We must have missed him. 
                         Uncle Owen isn't going to take this 
                         very well.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, would it help if you told him 
                         it was my fault.

                                     LUKE
                              (brightening)
                         Sure. He needs you. He'd probably 
                         only deactivate you for a day or 
                         so...

                                     THREEPIO
                         Deactivate! Well, on the other hand 
                         if you hadn't removed his restraining 
                         bolt...

                                     LUKE
                         Wait, there's something dead ahead 
                         on the scanner. It looks like our 
                         droid... hit the accelerator.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY

               From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen 
               gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground 
               two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert 
               cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the 
               marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle 
               and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs 
               the gun before it can be fired.

               The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, 
               speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an 
               animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in 
               the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON

               The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied 
               to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large 
               as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, 
               and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders 
               mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs 
               and ride off down the rugged bluff.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR

               The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, 
               with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands 
               before little Artoo.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey, whoa, just where do you think 
                         you're going?

               The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses 
               menacingly behind the little runaway.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke here is your rightful 
                         owner. We'll have no more of this 
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't 
                         talk to me about your mission, either. 
                         You're fortunate he doesn't blast 
                         you into a million pieces right here.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, come on. It's getting late. I 
                         only hope we can get back before 
                         Uncle Owen really blows up.

                                     THREEPIO
                         If you don't mind my saying so, sir, 
                         I think you should deactivate the 
                         little fugitive until you've gotten 
                         him back to your workshop.

                                     LUKE
                         No, he's not going to try anything.

               Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic 
               whistles and screams.

                                     LUKE
                         What's wrong with him now?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh my... sir, he says there are 
                         several creatures approaching from 
                         the southeast.

               Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

                                     LUKE
                         Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's 
                         have a look. Come on.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY

               Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and 
               scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the 
               two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young 
               adventurer.

                                     LUKE
                         There are two Banthas down there but 
                         I don't see any... wait a second, 
                         they're Sandpeople all right. I can 
                         see one of them now.

               Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his 
               electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of 
               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, 
               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled 
               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be 
               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles 
               down the side of the mountain.

               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed 
               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in 
               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block 
               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. 
               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced 
               to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands 
               over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible 
               shrieking laugh.

               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY

               Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in 
               the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the 
               inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the 
               speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts 
               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then 
               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan 
               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the 
               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.

               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight 
               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even 
               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and 
               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and 
               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating 
               eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes 
               as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a 
               slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

                                     BEN
                         Hello there! Come here my little 
                         friend. Don't be afraid.

               Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and 
               begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on 
               Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

                                     BEN
                         Don't worry, he'll be all right.

                                     LUKE
                         What happened?

                                     BEN
                         Rest easy, son, you've had a busy 
                         day. You're fortunate you're still 
                         in one piece.

                                     LUKE
                         Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to 
                         see you!

                                     BEN
                         The Jundland wastes are not to be 
                         traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, 
                         what brings you out this far?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, this little droid! I think he's 
                         searching for his former master... 
                         I've never seen such devotion in a 
                         droid before... there seems to be no 
                         stopping him. He claims to be the 
                         property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he 
                         a relative of yours? Do you know who 
                         he's talking about?

               Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

                                     BEN
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats 
                         a name I haven't heard in a long 
                         time... a long time.

                                     LUKE
                         I think my uncle knew him. He said 
                         he was dead.

                                     BEN
                         Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know him!

                                     BEN
                         Well of course, of course I know 
                         him. He's me! I haven't gone by the 
                         name Obi-Wan since oh, before you 
                         were born.

                                     LUKE
                         Then the droid does belong to you.

                                     BEN
                         Don't seem to remember ever owning a 
                         droid. Very interesting...

               He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

                                     BEN
                         I think we better get indoors. The 
                         Sandpeople are easily startled but 
                         they will soon be back and in greater 
                         numbers.

               Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic 
               beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio!

               EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY

               Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins 
               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and 
               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half 
               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.

               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then 
               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally 
               the mechanical man's systems turn on.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where am I? I must have taken a bad 
                         step...

                                     LUKE
                         Can you stand? We've got to get out 
                         of here before the Sandpeople return.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't think I can make it. You go 
                         on, Master Luke. There's no sense in 
                         you risking yourself on my account. 
                         I'm done for.

               Artoo makes a beeping sound.

                                     LUKE
                         No, you're not. What kind of talk is 
                         that?

               Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little 
               Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around 
               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the 
               air.

                                     BEN
                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.

               INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING

               The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but 
               still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and 
               security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as 
               old Ben sits thinking.

                                     LUKE
                         No, my father didn't fight in the 
                         wars. He was a navigator on a spice 
                         freighter.

                                     BEN
                         That's what your uncle told you. He 
                         didn't hold with your father's ideals. 
                         Thought he should have stayed here 
                         and not gotten involved.

                                     LUKE
                         You fought in the Clone Wars?

                                     BEN
                         Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the 
                         same as your father.

                                     LUKE
                         I wish I'd known him.

                                     BEN
                         He was the best star-pilot in the 
                         galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I 
                         understand you've become quite a 
                         good pilot yourself. And he was a 
                         good friend. Which reminds me...

               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  
               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the 
               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  
               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the 
               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle 
               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

                                     BEN
                         I have something here for you. Your 
                         father wanted you to have this when 
                         you were old enough, but your uncle 
                         wouldn't allow it. He feared you 
                         might follow old Obi-Wan on some 
                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like 
                         your father did.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Sir, if you'll not be needing me, 
                         I'll close down for awhile.

                                     LUKE
                         Sure, go ahead.

               Ben hands Luke the saber.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     BEN
                         Your fathers lightsaber. This is the 
                         weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy 
                         or as random as a blaster.

               Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out 
               about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across 
               the ceiling.

                                     BEN
                         An elegant weapon for a more civilized 
                         time. For over a thousand generations 
                         the Jedi Knights were the guardians 
                         of peace and justice in the Old 
                         Republic. Before the dark times, 
                         before the Empire.

               Luke hasn't really been listening.

                                     LUKE
                         How did my father die?

                                     BEN
                         A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who 
                         was a pupil of mine until he turned 
                         to evil, helped the Empire hunt down 
                         and destroy the Jedi Knights. He 
                         betrayed and murdered your father. 
                         Now the Jedi are all but extinct. 
                         Vader was seduced by the dark side 
                         of the Force.

                                     LUKE
                         The Force?

                                     BEN
                         Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi 
                         his power. It's an energy field 
                         created by all living things. It 
                         surrounds us and penetrates us. It 
                         binds the galaxy together.

               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     BEN
                         Now, let's see if we can't figure 
                         out what you are, my little friend. 
                         And where you come from.

                                     LUKE
                         I saw part of the message he was...

               Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful 
               young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

                                     BEN
                         I seem to have found it.

               Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before 
               his eyes.

                                     LEIA
                         General Kenobi, years ago you served 
                         my father in the Clone Wars. Now he 
                         begs you to help him in his struggle 
                         against the Empire. I regret that I 
                         am unable to present my father's 
                         request to you in person, but my 
                         ship has fallen under attack and I'm 
                         afraid my mission to bring you to 
                         Alderaan has failed. I have placed 
                         information vital to the survival of 
                         the Rebellion into the memory systems 
                         of this R2 unit. My father will know 
                         how to retrieve it. You must see 
                         this droid safely delivered to him 
                         on Alderaan. This is our most 
                         desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan 
                         Kenobi, you're my only hope.

               There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  
               Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs 
               on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

                                     BEN
                         You must learn the ways of the Force 
                         if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. 
                         I've got to go home. It's late, I'm 
                         in for it as it is.

                                     BEN
                         I need your help, Luke. She needs 
                         your help. I'm getting too old for 
                         this sort of thing.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't get involved! I've got work 
                         to do! It's not that I like the 
                         Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing 
                         I can do about it right now. It's 
                         such a long way from here.

                                     BEN
                         That's your uncle talking.

                                     LUKE
                              (sighing)
                         Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever 
                         going to explain this?

                                     BEN
                         Learn about the Force, Luke.

                                     LUKE
                         Look, I can take you as far as 
                         Anchorhead. You can get a transport 
                         there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're 
                         going.

                                     BEN
                         You must do what you feel is right, 
                         of course.

               Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black

               the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,

                         Until this battle station is fully 
                         operational we are vulnerable. The 
                         Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. 
                         They're more dangerous than you 
                         realize.

               The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

                                     MOTTI
                         Dangerous to your starfleet, 
                         Commander, not to this battle station!

                                     TAGGE
                         The Rebellion will continue to gain 
                         a support in the Imperial Senate as 
                         long as....

               Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut 
               short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial 
               outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, 
               The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and 
               bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his 
               place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind 
               him.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Imperial Senate will no longer 
                         be of any concern to us. I've just 
                         received word that the Emperor has 
                         dissolved the council permanently. 
                         The last remnants of the Old Republic 
                         have been swept away.

                                     TAGGE
                         That's impossible! How will the 
                         Emperor maintain control without the 
                         bureaucracy?

                                     TARKIN
                         The regional governors now have direct 
                         control over territories. Fear will 
                         keep the local systems in line. Fear 
                         of this battle station.

                                     TAGGE
                         And what of the Rebellion? If the 
                         Rebels have obtained a complete 
                         technical readout of this station, 
                         it is possible, however unlikely, 
                         that they might find a weakness and 
                         exploit it.

                                     VADER
                         The plans you refer to will soon be 
                         back in our hands.

                                     MOTTI
                         Any attack made by the Rebels against 
                         this station would be a useless 
                         gesture, no matter what technical 
                         data they've obtained. This station 
                         is now the ultimate power in the 
                         universe. I suggest we use it!

                                     VADER
                         Don't be too proud of this 
                         technological terror you've 
                         constructed. The ability to destroy 
                         a planet is insignificant next to 
                         the power of the Force.

                                     MOTTI
                         Don't try to frighten us with your 
                         sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your 
                         sad devotion to that ancient religion 
                         has not helped you conjure up the 
                         stolen data tapes, or given you 
                         clairvoyance enough to find the 
                         Rebel's hidden fort...

               Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's 
               spell.

                                     VADER
                         I find your lack of faith disturbing.

                                     TARKIN
                         Enough of this! Vader, release him!

                                     VADER
                         As you wish.

                                     TARKIN
                         This bickering is pointless. Lord 
                         Vader will provide us with the 
                         location of the Rebel fortress by 
                         the time this station is operational. 
                         We will then crush the Rebellion 
                         with one swift stroke.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas 
               Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble 
               and scattered bodies.

                                     LUKE
                         It looks like Sandpeople did this, 
                         all right. Look, here are Gaffi 
                         sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... 
                         I never heard of them hitting anything 
                         this big before.

               Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

                                     BEN
                         They didn't. But we are meant to 
                         think they did. These tracks are 
                         side by side. Sandpeople always ride 
                         single file to hide there numbers.

                                     LUKE
                         These are the same Jawas that sold 
                         us Artoo and Threepio.

                                     BEN
                         And these blast points, too accurate 
                         for Sandpeople. Only Imperial 
                         stormtroopers are so precise.

                                     LUKE
                         Why would Imperial troops want to 
                         slaughter Jawas?

               Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are 
               inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

                                     LUKE
                         If they traced the robots here, they 
                         may have learned who they sold them 
                         to. And that would lead them home!

               Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for 
               the speeder and jumps it.

                                     BEN
                         Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

               Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the 
               burning Sandcrawler.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.

               EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

               The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps 
               out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. 
               Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great 
               battle has taken place.

                                     LUKE
                         Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

               Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle. 
               Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is 
               stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new 
               resolve comes over him.

               EXT. SPACE

               Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow 
               several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is 
               filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a 
               giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

                                     VADER
                         And, now Your Highness, we will 
                         discuss the location of your hidden 
                         Rebel base.

               The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it 
               approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical 
               arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut 
               and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled 
               screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of 
               the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the 
               dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to 
               him.

                                     BEN
                         There's nothing you could have done, 
                         Luke, had you been there. You'd have 
                         been killed, too, and the droids 
                         would be in the hands of the Empire.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to come with you to Alderaan. 
                         There's nothing here for me now. I 
                         want to learn the ways of the Force 
                         and become a Jedi like my father.

               EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

               The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it 
               zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff 
               overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard 
               array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A 
               harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts 
               his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where 
               Ben is standing.

                                     BEN
                         Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never 
                         find a more wretched hive of scum 
                         and villainy. We must be cautious.

               Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined 
               smile.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
               hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper 
               questions Luke.

                                     TROOPER
                         How long have you had these droids?

                                     LUKE
                         About three or four seasons.

                                     BEN
                         They're for sale if you want them.

                                     TROOPER
                         Let me see your identification.

               Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while 
               Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

                                     BEN
                         You don't need to see his 
                         identification.

                                     TROOPER
                         We don't need to see his 
                         identification.

                                     BEN
                         These are not the droids your looking 
                         for.

                         for.

                                     BEN
                         He can go about his business.

                                     TROOPER
                         You can go about your business.

                                     BEN
                              (to Luke)
                         Move along.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina 
               on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of 
               transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are 
               parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle 
               the speeder.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting 
                         creatures.

               As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa 
               away.

                                     LUKE
                         Go on, go on. I can't understand how 
                         we got by those troopers. I thought 
                         we were dead.

                                     BEN
                         The Force can have a strong influence 
                         on the weak-minded. You will find it 
                         a powerful ally.

                                     LUKE
                         Do you really think we're going to 
                         find a pilot here that'll take us to 
                         Alderaan?

                                     BEN
                         Well, most of the best freighter 
                         pilots can be found here. Only watch 
                         your step. This place can be a little 
                         rough.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow 
               Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy 
               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic 
               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At 
               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, 
               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over 
               drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group 
               of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender 
               stops Luke and the robots.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We don't serve their kind here!

               Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many 
               outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's 
               drift.

                                     LUKE
                         What?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Your droids. They'll have to wait 
                         outside. We don't want them here.

               Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the 
               Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures 
               along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.

               Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

                                     LUKE
                         Listen, why don't you wait out by 
                         the speeder. We don't want any 
                         trouble.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I heartily agree with you sir.

               Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the 
               creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

               Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
               looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with 
               fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  
               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, 
               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a 
               sight to behold.

               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times 
               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets 
               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit 
               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between 
               Ben and the giant Wookiee.

               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips 
               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear 
               or whatever.

               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

                                     CREATURE
                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore 
               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby 
               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the 
               belligerent monstrosity.

                                     HUMAN
                         He doesn't like you.

                                     LUKE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HUMAN
                         I don't like you either.

               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some 
               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young 
               adventurer.

                                     HUMAN
                         Don't insult us. You just watch 
                         yourself. We're wanted men. I have 
                         the death sentence in twelve systems.

                                     LUKE
                         I'll be careful than.

                                     HUMAN
                         You'll be dead.

               The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar 
               moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His 
               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind 
               Luke.

                                     BEN
                         This little one isn't worth the 
                         effort. Come let me buy you 
                         something...

               A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young 
               would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables 
               and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. 
               With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked 
               chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. 
               The bartender panics.

                                     BARTENDER
                         No blasters! No blaster!

               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life 
               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut 
               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, 
               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns 
               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. 
               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, 
               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter 
               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is 
               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing 
               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben 
               points the the Wookiee.

                                     BEN
                         This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate 
                         on a ship that might suit our needs.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on 
               an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
               droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches 
               two stormtroopers in the street.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I don't like the look of this.

               INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking 
               instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and 
               follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is 
               sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years 
               old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, 
               and cocksure.

                                     HAN
                         Han Solo. I'm captain of the 
                         Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells 
                         me you're looking for passage to the 
                         Alderaan system.

                                     BEN
                         Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

                                     HAN
                         Fast ship? You've never heard of the 
                         Millennium Falcon?

                                     BEN
                         Should I have?

                                     HAN
                         It's the ship that made the Kessel 
                         run in less than twelve parsecs!

               Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with 
               obvious misinformation.

                                     HAN
                         I've outrun Imperial starships, not 
                         the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. 
                         I'm talking about the big Corellian 
                         ships now. She's fast enough for 
                         you, old man. What's the cargo?

                                     BEN
                         Only passengers. Myself, the boy, 
                         two droids, and no questions asked.

                                     HAN
                         What is it? Some kind of local 
                         trouble?

                                     BEN
                         Let's just say we'd like to avoid 
                         any Imperial entanglements.

                                     HAN
                         Well, that's the trick, isn't it? 
                         And it's going to cost you something 
                         extra. Ten thousand in advance.

                                     LUKE
                         Ten thousand? We could almost buy 
                         our own ship for that!

                                     HAN
                         But who's going to fly it, kid! You?

                                     LUKE
                         You bet I could. I'm not such a bad 
                         pilot myself! We don't have to sit 
                         here and listen...

                                     BEN
                         We haven't that much with us. But we 
                         could pay you two thousand now, plus 
                         fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

                                     HAN
                         Seventeen, huh!

               Han ponders this for a few moments.

                                     HAN
                         Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. 
                         We'll leave as soon as you're ready. 
                         Docking bay Ninety-four.

                                     BEN
                         Ninety-four.

                                     HAN
                         Looks like somebody's beginning to 
                         take an interest in your handiwork.

               Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers 
               looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some 
               questions. The bartender points to the booth.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, we'll check it out.

               The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben 
               are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

                                     HAN
                         Seventeen thousand! Those guys must 
                         really be desperate. This could really 
                         save my neck. Get back to the ship 
                         and get her ready.

                                     LUKE
                         That's okay. I'm never coming back 
                         to this planet again.

               INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

               As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
               with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature 
               speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.

                                     GREEDO
                         Going somewhere, Solo?

                                     HAN
                         Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I 
                         was just going to see your boss. 
                         Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

               Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the 
               gun on him.

                                     GREEDO
                         It's too late. You should have paid 
                         him when you had the chance. Jabba's 
                         put a price on your head, so large 
                         that every bounty hunter in the galaxy 
                         will be looking for you. I'm lucky I 
                         found you first.

                                     HAN
                         Yeah, but this time I got the money.

                                     GREEDO
                         If you give it to me, I might forget 
                         I found you.

                                     HAN
                         I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

                                     GREEDO
                         Jabba's through with you. He has no 
                         time for smugglers who drop their 
                         shipments at the first sign of an 
                         Imperial cruiser.

                                     HAN
                         Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you 
                         think I had a choice?

               Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

                                     GREEDO
                         You can tell that to Jabba. He may 
                         only take your ship.

                                     HAN
                         Over my dead body.

                                     GREEDO
                         That's the idea. I've been looking 
                         forward to killing you for a long 
                         time.

                                     HAN
                         Yes, I'll bet you have.

               Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of 
               light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as 
               the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up 
               and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some 
               coins as he leaves.

                                     HAN
                         Sorry about the mess.

                         Her resistance to the mind probe is 
                         considerable. It will be some time 
                         before we can extract any information 
                         from her.

               An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.

                         The final check-out is complete. All

                         shall we set?

                         Perhaps she would respond to an 
                         alternative form of persuasion.

                         I think it is time we demonstrate

                         With pleasure.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a 
               narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking 
               exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and 
               robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and 
               hiding from the hot winds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Lock the door, Artoo.

               One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves 
               on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and 
               Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, check that side of the 
                         street. It's secure. Move on to the 
                         next door.

               The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I would much rather have gone with 
                         Master Luke than stay here with you. 
                         I don't know what all the trouble is 
                         about, but I'm sure it must be your 
                         fault.

               Artoo makes beeping sounds.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You watch your language!

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED 
               SPEEDER LOT

               Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, 
               talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder 
               dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass 
               by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.

                                     LUKE
                         He says it's the best he can do. 
                         Since the XP-38 came out, they're 
                         just not in demand.

                                     BEN
                         It will be enough.

               Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty 
               alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like 
               creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his 
               faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature 
               moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as 
               they disappear down another alley.

                                     BEN
                         If the ship's as fast as he's 
                         boasting, we ought to do well.

               INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY

               Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple 
               creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is 
               the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is 
               a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is 
               a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and 
               a huge ugly mouth.

                                     JABBA
                         Come on out, Solo!

               A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and 
               they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee, 
               Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.

                                     HAN
                         I've been waiting for you, Jabba.

                                     JABBA
                         I expected you would be.

                                     HAN
                         I'm not the type to run.

                                     JABBA
                              (fatherly-smooth)
                         Han, my boy, there are times when 
                         you disappoint me... why haven't you 
                         paid me? And why did you have to fry 
                         poor Greedo like that... after all 
                         we've been through together.

                                     HAN
                         You sent Greedo to blast me.

                                     JABBA
                              (mock surprise)
                         Han, why you're the best smuggler in 
                         the business. You're too valuable to 
                         fry. He was only relaying my concern 
                         at your delays. He wasn't going to 
                         blast you.

                                     HAN
                         I think he thought he was. Next time 
                         don't send one of those twerps. If 
                         you've got something to say to me, 
                         come see me yourself.

                                     JABBA
                         Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to 
                         dump that shipment of spice... you 
                         understand I just can't make an 
                         exception. Where would I be if every 
                         pilot who smuggled for me dumped 
                         their shipment at the first sign of 
                         an Imperial starship? It's not good 
                         business.

                                     HAN
                         You know, even I get boarded 
                         sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, 
                         but I've got a charter now and I can 
                         pay you back, plus a little extra. I 
                         just need some more time.

                                     JABBA
                              (to his men)
                         Put your blasters away. Han, my boy, 
                         I'm only doing this because you're 
                         the best and I need you. So, for an 
                         extra, say twenty percent I'll give 
                         you a little more time... but this 
                         is it. If you disappoint me again, 
                         I'll put a price on your head so 
                         large you won't be able to go near a 
                         civilized system for the rest of 
                         your short life.

                                     HAN
                         Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my 
                         pleasure.

               EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY

               Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 
               94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.  
               Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. 
               The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder 
               lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small 
               transmitter.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is 
               Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a 
               large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that 
               could only loosely be called a starship.

                                     LUKE
                         What a piece of junk.

               The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

                                     HAN
                         She'll make point five beyond the 
                         speed of light. She may not look 
                         like much, but she's got it where it 
                         counts, kid. I've added some special 
                         modifications myself.

               Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about 
               all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others 
               to follow.

                                     HAN
                         We're a little rushed, so if you'll 
                         hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

               The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han 
               Solo.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty 
               engines of the starship.

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

               Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium 
               Falcon passing Solo.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hello, sir.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

               Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad 
               creature.

                                     TROOPER
                         Which way?

               The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking 
               bay.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right, men. Load your weapons!

               INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94]

               The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the 
               docking bay entrance.

                                     TROOPER
                         Stop that ship!

               Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing 
               into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as 
               he ducks into the spaceship.

                                     TROOPER
                         Blast 'em!

               Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots 
               which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The 
               pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that 
               slams the overhead entry shut.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

                                     HAN
                         Chewie, get us out of here!

               The group straps in for take off.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I 
                         hate space travel.

               EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS

               The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general 
               alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above 
               the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the 
               morning sky.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who 
               chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.  
               Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, 
               makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

                                     HAN
                         It looks like an Imperial cruiser. 
                         Our passengers must be hotter than I 
                         thought. Try and hold them off. Angle 
                         the deflector shield while I make 
                         the calculations for the jump to 
                         light speed.

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow 
               planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial 
               stardestroyers.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy 
               spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the 
               cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

                                     HAN
                         Stay sharp! There are two more coming 
                         in; they're going to try to cut us 
                         off.

                                     LUKE
                         Why don't you outrun them? I thought 
                         you said this thing was fast.

                                     HAN
                         Watch your mouth, kid, or you're 
                         going to find yourself floating home. 
                         We'll be safe enough once we make 
                         the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I 
                         know a few maneuvers. We'll lose 
                         them!

               EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

               Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.

                                     HAN
                         Here's where the fun begins!

                                     BEN
                         How long before you can make the 
                         jump to light speed?

                                     HAN
                         It'll take a few moments to get the 
                         coordinates from the navi-computer.

               The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you kidding? At the rate they're 
                         gaining...

                                     HAN
                         Traveling through hyperspace isn't 
                         like dusting crops, boy! Without 
                         precise calculations we could fly 
                         right through a star or bounce too 
                         close to a supernova and that'd end 
                         your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

               The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red 
               warning light begins to flash.

                                     LUKE
                         What's that flashing?

                                     HAN
                         We're losing our deflector shield. 
                         Go strap yourself in, I'm going to 
                         make the jump to light speed.

               The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if 
               crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship 
               makes the jump to hyperspace.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a 
               second.

               EXT. DEATH STAR

               Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before 
               Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen 
               displaying a small green planet.

                                     MOTTI
                         We've entered the Alderaan system.

               Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her 
               hands are bound.

                                     LEIA
                         Governor Tarkin, I should have 
                         expected to find you holding Vader's 
                         leash. I recognized your foul stench 
                         when I was brought on board.

                                     TARKIN
                         Charming to the last. You don't know 
                         how hard I found it signing the order 
                         to terminate your life!

                                     LEIA
                         I surprised you had the courage to 
                         take the responsibility yourself!

                                     TARKIN
                         Princess Leia, before your execution 
                         I would like you to be my guest at a 
                         ceremony that will make this battle 
                         station operational. No star system 
                         will dare oppose the Emperor now.

                                     LEIA
                         The more you tighten your grip, 
                         Tarkin, the more star systems will 
                         slip through your fingers.

                                     TARKIN
                         Not after we demonstrate the power 
                         of this station. In a way, you have 
                         determined the choice of the planet 
                         that'll be destroyed first. Since 
                         you are reluctant to provide us with 
                         the location of the Rebel base, I 
                         have chosen to test this station's 
                         destructive power... on your home 
                         planet of Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                         No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no 
                         weapons. You can't possibly...

                                     TARKIN
                         You would prefer another target? A 
                         military target? Then name the system!

               Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

                                     TARKIN
                         I grow tired of asking this. So it'll 
                         be the last time. Where is the Rebel 
                         base?

               Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to 
               Alderaan.

                                     LEIA
                              (softly)
                         Dantooine.

               Leia lowers her head.

                                     LEIA
                         They're on Dantooine.

                                     TARKIN
                         There. You see Lord Vader, she can 
                         be reasonable.
                              (addressing Motti)
                         Continue with the operation. You may 
                         fire when ready.

                                     LEIA
                         What?

                                     TARKIN
                         You're far too trusting. Dantooine 
                         is too remote to make an effective 
                         demonstration. But don't worry. We 
                         will deal with your Rebel friends 
                         soon enough.

                                     LEIA
                         No!

               INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

                                     VADER
                         Commence primary ignition.

               A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A 
               hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.  
               Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another 
               lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A 
               huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area 
               and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. 
               The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" 
               robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters, 
               seems almost faint.

                                     LUKE
                         Are you all right? What's wrong?

                                     BEN
                         I felt a great disturbance in the 
                         Force... as if millions of voices 
                         suddenly cried out in terror and 
                         were suddenly silenced. I fear 
                         something terrible has happened.

               Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then 
               he fixes his gaze on Luke.

                                     BEN
                         You'd better get on with your 
                         exercises.

               Han Solo enters the room.

                                     HAN
                         Well, you can forget your troubles 
                         with those Imperial slugs. I told 
                         you I'd outrun 'em.

               Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

                                     HAN
                         Don't everyone thank me at once.

               Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a 
               game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move 
               along a chess-type board.

                                     HAN
                         Anyway, we should be at Alderaan 
                         about oh-two-hundred hours.

               Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table 
               covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the 
               table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca 
               seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur- 
               covered arms over his head.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Now be careful, Artoo.

               Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his 
               stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures 
               to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's 
               face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. 
               Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and 
               begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He made a fair move. Screaming about 
                         it won't help you.

                                     HAN
                              (interrupting)
                         Let him have it. It's not wise to 
                         upset a Wookiee.

                                     THREEPIO
                         But sir, nobody worries about 
                         upsetting a droid.

                                     HAN
                         That's 'cause droids don't pull 
                         people's arms out of their socket 
                         when they lose. Wookiees are known 
                         to do that.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I see your point, sir. I suggest a 
                         new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee 
                         win.

               Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems 
               frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his 
               head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.  
               Han watches with a bit of smugness.

                                     BEN
                         Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force 
                         flowing through him.

                                     LUKE
                         You mean it controls your actions?

                                     BEN
                         Partially. But it also obeys your 
                         commands.

               Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a 
               "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae, 
               hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of 
               the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift 
               lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't 
               move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, 
               then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood 
               red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing 
               him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

                                     HAN
                         Hokey religions and ancient weapons 
                         are no match for a good blaster at 
                         your side, kid.

                                     LUKE
                         You don't believe in the Force, do 
                         you?

                                     HAN
                         Kid, I've flown from one side of 
                         this galaxy to the other. I've seen 
                         a lot of strange stuff, but I've 
                         never seen anything to make me believe 
                         there's one all-powerful force 
                         controlling everything. There's no 
                         mystical energy field that controls 
                         my destiny.

               Ben smiles quietly.

                                     HAN
                         It's all a lot of simple tricks and 
                         nonsense.

                                     BEN
                         I suggest you try it again, Luke.

               Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his 
               eyes.

                                     BEN
                         This time, let go your conscious 
                         self and act on instinct.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         With the blast shield down, I can't 
                         even see. How am I supposed to fight?

                                     BEN
                         Your eyes can deceive you. Don't 
                         trust them.

               Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker 
               into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then 
               drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly 
               missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits 
               Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful

               Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes 
               a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the 
               bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original 
               position.

                         thing as luck.

                         Look, going good against remotes is 
                         one thing. Going good against the

                         Our scout ships have reached 
                         Dantooine. They found the remains of 
                         a Rebel base, but they estimate that 
                         it has been deserted for some time. 
                         They are now conducting an extensive 
                         search of the surrounding systems.

                         I told you she would never consciously 
                         betray the Rebellion.

               EXT. HYPERSPACE

               The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange 
               surreal light show surrounds the ship.

                         Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in 
                         the sublight engines.

               Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window 
               stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then 
               stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently 
               shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering 
               the sides of the ship.

                                     HAN
                         What the...? Aw, we've come out of 
                         hyperspace into a meteor shower. 
                         Some kind of asteroid collision. 
                         It's not on any of the charts.

               The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool 
               in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing 
               cockpit.

                         blown away.

                         What? How?

               Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to 
               settle down.

                         The entire starfleet couldn't destroy 
                         the whole planet. It'd take a thousand 
                         ships with more fire power than 
                         I've...

               A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled 
               alarm starts humming.

                                     HAN
                         There's another ship coming in.

                         Maybe they know what happened.

                         It's an Imperial fighter.

               Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside 
               the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned 
               Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         It followed us!

                         It'd be as well to let it go. It's 
                         too far out of range.

               The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the

               The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny 
               fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter

               The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as 
               they race toward camera and disappear over head.

               The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or

               The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away 
               toward the gargantuan battle station.

                         Yes, sir.

                                     VADER
                         I sense something... a presence I 
                         haven't felt since...

               Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.

                                     OFFICER
                         Get me a scanning crew in here on 
                         the double. I want every part of 
                         this ship checked!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY

               A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In 
               a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant 
               officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly 
               pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his 
               head out of a third locker.

                                     LUKE
                         Boy, it's lucky you had these 
                         compartments.

                                     HAN
                         I use them for smuggling. I never 
                         thought I'd be smuggling myself in 
                         them. This is ridiculous. Even if I 
                         could take off, I'd never get past 
                         the tractor beam.

                                     BEN
                         Leave that to me!

                                     HAN
                         Damn fool. I knew that you were going 
                         to say that!

                                     BEN
                         Who's the more foolish... the fool 
                         or the fool who follows him?

               Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the 
               two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.

                                     TROOPER
                         The ship's all yours. If the scanners 
                         pick up anything, report it 
                         immediately. All right, let's go.

               The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound 
               is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.

                                     HAN'S VOICE
                         Hey down there, could you give us a 
                         hand with this?

               The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire 
               is heard.

               INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE

               In a very small command office near the entrance to the 
               pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices 
               the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at 
                         your post? TX-four-one-two, do you 
                         copy?

               A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and 
               waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating 
               his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his 
               head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an 
               annoyed look.

                                     GANTRY OFFICER
                         Take over. We've got a bad 
                         transmitter. I'll see what I can do.

               As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing 
               the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary 
               state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling 
               howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. 
               The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted 
               by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the 
               robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed 
               as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

                                     LUKE
                         You know, between his howling and 
                         your blasting everything in sight, 
                         it's a wonder the whole station 
                         doesn't know we're here.

                                     HAN
                         Bring them on! I prefer a straight 
                         fight to all this sneaking around.

                                     THREEPIO
                         We found the computer outlet, sir.

               Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of 
               the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it 
               carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  
               Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

                                     BEN
                         Plug in. He should be able to 
                         interpret the entire Imperial computer 
                         network.

               Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the 
               vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information 
               to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

                                     THREEPIO
                         He says he's found the main computer 
                         to power the tractor beam that's 
                         holding the ship here. He'll try to 
                         make the precise location appear on 
                         the monitor.

               The computer monitor flashes readouts.

                                     THREEPIO
                         The tractor beam is coupled to the 
                         main reactor in seven locations. A 
                         power loss at one of the terminals 
                         will allow the ship to leave.

               Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

                                     BEN
                         I don't think you boys can help. I 
                         must go alone.

                                     HAN
                         Whatever you say. I've done more 
                         that I bargained for on this trip 
                         already.

                                     LUKE
                         I want to go with you.

                                     BEN
                         Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch 
                         over the droids.

                                     LUKE
                         But he can...

                                     BEN
                         They must be delivered safely or 
                         other star systems will suffer the 
                         same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny 
                         lies along a different path than 
                         mine. The Force will be with you... 
                         always!

               Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps 
               out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey 
               hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head 
               in agreement.

                                     HAN
                         Boy you said it, Chewie.

               Han looks at Luke.

                                     HAN
                         Where did you dig up that old fossil?

                                     LUKE
                         Ben is a great man.

                                     HAN
                         Yeah, great at getting us into 
                         trouble.

                                     LUKE
                         I didn't hear you give any ideas...

                                     HAN
                         Well, anything would be better than 
                         just hanging around waiting for him 
                         to pick us up...

                                     LUKE
                         Who do you think...

               Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  
               Luke goes over to him.

                                     LUKE
                         What is it?

                                     THREEPIO
                         I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. 
                         He says "I found her", and keeps 
                         repeating, "She's here."

                                     LUKE
                         Well, who... who has he found?

               Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Princess Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         The princess? She's here?

                                     HAN
                         Princess? What's going on?

                                     THREEPIO
                         Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
                         three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to 
                         be terminated.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no! We've got to do something.

                                     HAN
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LUKE
                         The droid belongs to her. She's the 
                         one in the message... We've got to 
                         help her.

                                     HAN
                         Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. 
                         The old man wants us to wait right 
                         here.

                                     LUKE
                         But he didn't know she was here. 
                         Look, will you just find a way back 
                         into the detention block?

                                     HAN
                         I'm not going anywhere.

                                     LUKE
                         They're going to execute her. Look, 
                         a few minutes ago you said you didn't 
                         want to just wait here to be captured. 
                         Now all you want to do is stay.

                                     HAN
                         Marching into the detention area is 
                         not what I had in mind.

                                     LUKE
                         But they're going to kill her!

                                     HAN
                         Better her than me...

                                     LUKE
                         She's rich.

               Chewbacca growls.

                                     HAN
                         Rich?

                                     LUKE
                         Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you 
                         were to rescue her, the reward would 
                         be...

                                     HAN
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Well more wealth that you can imagine.

                                     HAN
                         I don't know, I can imagine quite a 
                         bit!

                                     LUKE
                         You'll get it!

                                     HAN
                         I better!

                                     LUKE
                         You will...

                                     HAN
                         All right, kid. But you'd better be 
                         right about this.

               Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

                                     LUKE
                         All right.

                                     HAN
                         What's your plan?

                                     LUKE
                         Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders 
                         there will you?

               Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on 
                         you.

               Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

                                     LUKE
                         Okay. Han, you put these on.

               Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.

                                     HAN
                         Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know 
                         what he has in mind.

               The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as 
               Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for 
                         asking... but, ah... what should 
                         Artoo and I do if we're discovered 
                         here?

                                     LUKE
                         Lock the door!

                                     HAN
                         And hope they don't have blasters.

                                     THREEPIO
                         That isn't very reassuring.

               Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and 
               start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE

               Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits 
               as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, 
               bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio 
               completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious 
               glance.

               Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't see a thing in this helmet.

               A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away 
               by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and 
               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY

               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main 
               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot 
               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end 
               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then 
               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting 
               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. 
               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY 
               AREA

               Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door 
               slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards 
               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates 
               are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

                                     HAN
                         This is not going to work.

                                     LUKE
                         Why didn't you say so before?

                                     HAN
                         I did say so before!

               INT. DETENTION AREA

               Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches 
               the trio.

                                     OFFICER
                         Where are you taking this... thing?

               Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut 
               up.

                                     LUKE
                         Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
                         three-eight.

                                     OFFICER
                         I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear 
                         it.

               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in 
               the information. There are only three other troopers in the 
               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the 
               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of 
               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.

               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one 
               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

                                     HAN
                         Look out! He's loose!

                                     LUKE
                         He's going to pull us all apart.

                                     HAN
                         Go get him!

               The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and 
               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are 
               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of 
               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser 
               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the 
               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is 
               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink 
               system, which is screeching questions about what is going 
               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.

                                     HAN
                         We've got to find out which cell 
                         this princess of yours is in. Here 
                         it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. 
                         You go get her. I'll hold them here.

               Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into 
               the buzzing comlink.

                                     HAN
                              (sounding official)
                         Everything is under control. Situation 
                         normal.

                         Uh... had a slight weapons

                         We're all fine here, now, thank you.

                         Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor 
                         leak here now. Give us a few minutes 
                         to lock it down. Large leak... very 
                         dangerous.

               Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.

                                     HAN
                         Boring conversation anyway.
                              (yelling down the 
                              hall)
                         Luke! We're going to have company!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW

               Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door 
               away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees 
               the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping 
               and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on 
               her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands 
               staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

                                     LEIA
                              (finally)
                         Aren't you a little short to be a 
                         stormtrooper?

               Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

                                     LUKE
                         What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke 
                         Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

                                     LEIA
                         You're who?

                         I'm here to rescue you. I've got 
                         your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben 
                         Kenobi.

                                     LEIA
                         Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?

                         Come on!

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

               Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the 
               far end of the conference table.

                                     VADER
                         He is here...

                                     TARKIN
                         Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think 
                         so?

                         A tremor in the Force. The last time 
                         I felt it was in the presence of my 
                         old master.

                                     TARKIN
                         Surely he must be dead by now.

                                     VADER
                         Don't underestimate the power of the 
                         Force.

                                     TARKIN
                         The Jedi are extinct, their fire has 
                         gone out of the universe. You, my 
                         friend, are all that's left of their 
                         religion.

               There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

                                     TARKIN
                         If you're right, he must not be 
                         allowed to escape.

                                     VADER
                         Escape is not his plan. I must face 
                         him alone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY

               An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the 
               elevator door.

                                     HAN
                         Chewie!

               Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

                                     HAN
                         Get behind me! Get behind me!

               A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door 
               through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

               Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke 
               and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting 
               up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

                                     HAN
                         Can't get out that way.

                                     LEIA
                         Looks like you managed to cut off 
                         our only escape route.

                                     HAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Maybe you'd like it back in your 
                         cell, Your Highness.

               Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they 
               continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their 
               way down the corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

                         We've been cut off! Are there any 
                         other ways out of the cell bay?... 
                         What was that? I didn't copy!

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER

               Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and 
               whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink 
               transmitter.

                                     THREEPIO
                         I said, all systems have been alerted 
                         to your presence, sir. The main 
                         entrance seems to be the only way in 
                         or out; all other information on 
                         your level is restricted.

               Someone begins banging on the door.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

               Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as 
               they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca 
               are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far 
               and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke 
               fills the narrow cell corridor.

                                     LUKE
                         There isn't any other way out.

                         I can't hold them off forever! Now 
                         what?

                                     LEIA
                         This is some rescue. When you came 
                         in here, didn't you have a plan for 
                         getting out?

                                     HAN
                              (pointing to Luke)
                         He's the brains, sweetheart.

               Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, I didn't...

               The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in 
               the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

                                     HAN
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     LEIA
                         Somebody has to save our skins. Into 
                         the garbage chute, wise guy.

               She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca 
               look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and 
               says something.

                                     HAN
                         Get in there you big furry oaf! I 
                         don't care what you smell! Get in 
                         there and don't worry about it.

               Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the 
               tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their 
               way toward the opening.

                                     HAN
                         Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to 
                         kill her or I'm beginning to like 
                         her. Get in there!

               Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires 
               off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then 
               slides into the chute himself and is gone.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  
               Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He 
               finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't 
               budge.

                                     HAN
                              (sarcastically)
                         Oh! The garbage chute was a really 
                         wonderful idea. What an incredible 
                         smell you've discovered! Let's get 
                         out of here! Get away from there...

                                     LUKE
                         No! wait!

               Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The 
               laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  
               Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes 
               almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a 
               rather grim look on her face.

                                     LUKE
                         Will you forget it? I already tried 
                         it. It's magnetically sealed!

                                     LEIA
                         Put that thing away! You're going to 
                         get us all killed.

                                     HAN
                         Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I 
                         had everything under control until 
                         you led us down here. You know, it's 
                         not going to take them long to figure 
                         out what happened to us.

                                     LEIA
                         It could be worse...

               A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the 
               murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins 
               to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols 
               drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

                                     HAN
                         It's worse.

                                     LUKE
                         There's something alive in here!

                                     HAN
                         That's your imagination.

                                     LUKE
                         Something just moves past my leg! 
                         Look! Did you see that?

                                     HAN
                         What?

                                     LUKE
                         Help!

               Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

                                     HAN
                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air 
               and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around 
               his throat.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke!

               Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

                                     LUKE
                         Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.

                                     HAN
                         Where?

                                     LUKE
                         Anywhere! Oh!!

               Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the 
               muck by the slimy tentacle.

                                     HAN
                         Luke! Luke!

               Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and 
               move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  
               Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca 
               howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke 
               suddenly bobs to the surface.

                                     LEIA
                         Grab him!

               Luke seems to be released by the thing.

                                     LEIA
                         What happened?

                                     LUKE
                         I don't know, it just let go of me 
                         and disappeared...

                                     HAN
                         I've got a very bad feeling about 
                         this.

               Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and 
               edge toward the Rebels.

                                     LUKE
                         The walls are moving!

                                     LEIA
                         Don't just stand there. Try to brace 
                         it with something.

               They place poles and long metal beams between the closing 
               walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant 
               trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

                                     LUKE
                         Wait a minute!

               Luke pulls out his comlink.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! 
                         Where could he be?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE

               A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for 
               See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which 
               is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and 
               Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great 
               explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the 
               floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Take over!
                              (pointing to the dead 
                              officer)
                         See to him! Look there!

               A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides 
               open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows 
               his bronze companion out into the office.

                                     THREEPIO
                         They're madmen! They're heading for 
                         the prison level. If you hurry, you 
                         might catch them.

                                     FIRST OFFICER
                              (to his troops)
                         Follow me! You stand guard.

               The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to 
               watch over the command office.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         Come on!

               The guard aims a blaster at them.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh! All this excitement has overrun 
                         the circuits of my counterpart here. 
                         If you don't mind, I'd like to take 
                         him down to maintenance.

                                     TROOPER
                         All right.

               The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries 
               out the door.

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.  
               Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his 
               giant paws.

               Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is 
               snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

                                     LUKE
                         Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

               Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole. 
               Leia begins to sink into the trash.

                                     HAN
                         Get to the top!

                         Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, 
                         will you come in?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     THREEPIO
                         They aren't here! Something must 
                         have happened to them. See if they've 
                         been captured.

               Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall 
               socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from 
               the tiny robot.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hurry!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against 
               the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each 
               other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds 
               it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels 
               the first crushing pressure against her body.

                                     HAN
                         One thing's for sure. We're all going 
                         to be a lot thinner!

                              (to Artoo)
                         Thank goodness, they haven't found 
                         them! Where could they be?

               Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I 
                         turned it off!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his 
               head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz 
               and he rips it off his belt.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

               Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard, 
               but not distinctly.

                                     THREEPIO

                                     LUKE
                              (over comlink)
                         Shut down all the garbage mashers on 
                         the detention level.

                                     THREEPIO
                              (to Artoo)
                         No. Shut them all down! Hurry!

               Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible 
               screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! 
                         Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast 
                         enough. It's all my fault! My poor 
                         master!

                                     LUKE
                              (over comlink)
                         Threepio, we're all right!

               INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

               The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. 
               The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace 
               in the background.

                                     LUKE
                         We're all right. You did great.

               Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a 
               number.

                                     LUKE
                         Hey... hey, open the pressure 
                         maintenance hatch on unit number... 
                         where are we?

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

                                     HAN
                              (over comlink)
                         Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.

               INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH

               Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge 
               tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. 
               The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. 
               The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading 
               to a control panel that connects two large cables. He 
               carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, 
               and several lights on the board go from red to blue.

               INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY

               The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.  
               Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster 
               belts.

                                     HAN
                         If we can just avoid any more female 
                         advice, we ought to be able to get 
                         out of here.

               Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster 
               from Solo.

                                     LUKE
                         Well, let's get moving!

               Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage 
               room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

                                     HAN
                              (to Chewie)
                         Where are you going?

               The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy 
               tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a 
               victim. Han aims his pistol.

                                     LEIA
                         No, wait. They'll hear!

               Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes 
               relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply 
               shakes his head in disgust.

                                     HAN
                              (to Chewie)
                         Come here, you big coward!

               Chewie shakes his head "no."

                                     HAN
                         Chewie! Come here!

                                     LEIA
                         Listen. I don't know who you are, or 
                         where you came from, but from now 
                         on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

               Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

                                     HAN
                         Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get 
                         one thing straight! I take orders 
                         from one person! Me!

                                     LEIA
                         It's a wonder you're still alive.
                              (looking at Chewie)
                         Will somebody get this big walking 
                         carpet out of my way?

               Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

                                     HAN
                         No reward is worth this.

               They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

               INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH

               Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of 
               stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly 
               slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few 
               feet of him.

                                     OFFICER
                         Secure this area until the alert is 
                         canceled.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Give me regular reports.

               All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Do you know what's going on?

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         Maybe it's another drill.

               Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers 
               as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand 
               toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the 
               other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips 
               past the troopers and into the main hallway.

                                     SECOND TROOPER
                         What was that?

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about 
                         it.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and 
               stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers 
               are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

                                     HAN
                              (looking at his ship)
                         There she is.

                                     LUKE
                         See-Threepio, do you copy?

                                     THREEPIO
                              (voice)
                         For the moment. Uh, we're in the 
                         main hangar across from the ship.

                                     LUKE
                         We're right above you. Stand by.

               Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of 
               the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and 
               points out the window to the ship.

                                     LEIA
                         You came in that thing? You're braver 
                         that I thought.

                                     HAN
                         Nice! Come on!

               Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the 
               hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty 
               Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are 
               taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

                                     FIRST TROOPER
                         It's them! Blast them!

               Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges 
               the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the 
               stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down 
               the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke and Leia)
                         Get back to the ship!

                                     LUKE
                         Where are you going? Come back!

               Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

                                     LEIA
                         He certainly has courage.

                                     LUKE
                         What good will it do us if he gets 
                         himself killed? Come on!

               Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for 
               muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke 
               and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is 
               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a 
               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few 
               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops 
               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are 
               moving into an attack position in front of the lone 
               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops 
               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt 
               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of 
               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate 
               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of 
               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running 
               the other way also.

               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down 
               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They 
               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an 
               open hatchway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT

               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge 
               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. 
               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, 
               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance 
               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of 
               his arm and pulls him back.

                                     LUKE
                              (gasping)
                         I think we took a wrong turn.

               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby 
               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at 
               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch 
               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving 
               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  
               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

                                     LEIA
                         There's no lock!

               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

                                     LUKE
                         That oughta hold it for a while.

                                     LEIA
                         Quick, we've got to get across. Find 
                         the control that extends the bridge.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, I think I just blasted it.

               Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the 
               stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making 
               ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

                                     LEIA
                         They're coming through!

               Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when 
               laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol 
               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across 
               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops 
               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, 
               and grabs at his chest.

               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by 
               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move 
               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

                                     LUKE
                         Here, hold this.

               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. 
               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge 
               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the 
               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears 
               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  
               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet 
               of more troops.

                                     LEIA
                         Here they come!

               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and 
               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the 
               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He 
               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the 
               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him 
               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

                                     LEIA
                         For luck!

               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss 
               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as 
               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the 
               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at 
               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into 
               the tiny subhallway.

               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY

               Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several 
               stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks 
               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the 
               opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of 
               the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the 
               pirateship entry ramp.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Where could they be?

               Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left 
               and right, beeping a response.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

               Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several 
               troopers hot on their trail.

                                     TROOPER
                         Close the blast doors!

               At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in 
               front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion 
               race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage 
               to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops 
               before the doors slam shut.

                                     TROOPER
                         Open the blast doors! Open the blast 
                         doors!

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar 
               where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, 
               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not 
               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his 
               and steps slowly forward.

                                     VADER
                         I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. 
                         We meet again, at last. The circle 
                         is now complete.

               Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive 
               position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

                                     VADER
                         When I left you, I was but the 
                         learner; now I am the master.

                                     BEN
                         Only a master of evil, Darth.

               The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few 
               moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right 
               moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, 
               as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He 
               shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.

               Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked 
               by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke 
               by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's 
               blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark 
               Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. 
               The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments 
               with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing 
               sound.

                                     VADER
                         Your powers are weak, old man.

                                     BEN
                         You can't win, Darth. If you strike 
                         me down, I shall become more powerful 
                         than you can possibly imagine.

               Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

               Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back 
               against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the 
               Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

                                     HAN
                         Didn't we just leave this party?

               Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.

                                     HAN
                         What kept you?

                                     LEIA
                         We ran into some old friends.

                                     LUKE
                         Is the ship all right?

                                     HAN
                         Seems okay, if we can get to it. 
                         Just hope the old man got the tractor 
                         beam out of commission.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they 
               hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact. 
               Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord 
               of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his 
               group's vantage point.

                                     LUKE
                         Look!

               Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader 
               emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking 
               bay.

               INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

               Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's 
               Imperial docking bay.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Come on, Artoo, we're going!

               Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who 
               were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards 
               Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

               INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

               Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The 
               troops rush toward the battling knights.

                                     HAN
                         Now's our chance! Go!

               They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops 
               charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader 
               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings 
               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to 
               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts 
               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene 
               look on his face.

               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's 
               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  
               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the 
               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers 
               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two 
               and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.  
               The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium 
               Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns 
               their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and 
               advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke)
                         Come on!

                                     LEIA
                         Come on! Luke, its too late!

                                     HAN
                         Blast the door! Kid!

               Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it 
               explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge 
               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close 
               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the 
               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his 
               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, 
               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He 
               fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Run, Luke! Run!

               Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns 
               toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the 
               troopers and races into the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. 
               The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the 
               ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.

                                     HAN
                         I hope the old man got that tractor 
                         beam out if commission, or this is 
                         going to be a real short trip. Okay, 
                         hit it!

               Chewbacca growls in agreement.

               EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

               The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking 
               bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness 
               of space.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off 
               blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around 
               him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She 
               sits down beside him.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

                                     HAN
                              (to Chewie)
                         We're coming up on the sentry ships. 
                         Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector 
                         shields while I charge up the main 
                         guns!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

               Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, 
               as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

                                     LUKE
                         I can't believe he's gone.

               Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

                                     LEIA
                         There wasn't anything you could have 
                         done.

               Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the 
               princess.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke)
                         Come on, buddy, we're not out of 
                         this yet!

               Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads 
               for the cockpit.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

               Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling 
               into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large 
               rotating turrets on either side of the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT

               Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of 
               his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.

                                     HAN
                              (to Luke)

               Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking 
               TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls 
               as the ship bounces slightly.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT - COCKPIT

               Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as

               The Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon, 
               one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship.

               INT. TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts 
               his maneuvering joy stick.

               EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - IN SPACE

               The TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as 
               it passes.

               Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo. 
               The pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in 
               the room and then comes back on.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS

               A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and 
               fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as 
               the fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor 
               hit, and bounces slightly.

               EXT. SPACE

               The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the

               A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The 
               ship lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet 
               fill of small computer chips.

                                     THREEPIO

                         Don't worry, she'll hold together.

               An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel, 
               causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

                                     HAN

               Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control 
               panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant 
               beeping all the while.

               Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter 
               with his laser cannon.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT

               Solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter.

               EXT. SPACE

               A TIE fighter streaks in front of the starship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Leia watches the TIE fighter ship fly over.

               EXT. SPACE

               A TIE fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms 
               overhead.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing 
               laserbeams from his cannon.

               EXT. TIE FIGHTER

               A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a 
               fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He 
               connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs 
               victoriously.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon, 
               unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke, 
               smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular 
               direct hit.

                                     LUKE
                         Got him! I got him!

               Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke gleefully 
               returns.

                                     HAN
                         Great kid! Don't get cocky.

               Han turns back to his laser cannon.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking 
               over her shoulder out the ports.

                                     LEIA
                         There are still two more of them out 
                         there!

               EXT. SPACE

               A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts 
               at it.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke and Han look into their respective projected target 
               screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han 
               swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser 
               cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts 
               in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his 
               face.

               EXT. SPACE

               The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing 
               destructive blasts at it.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

               Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, 
               and it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected 
               screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces 
               slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.

               EXT. SPACE - TIE FIGHTER

               The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in, 
               firing upon the Falcon.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT

               Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc 
               of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the 
               pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon 
               hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower 
               of burning fragments.

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         That's it! We did it!

               The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.

                                     LEIA
                         We did it!

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY

               Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled 
               in the smoking, sparking wires.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Help! I think I'm melting!
                              (to Artoo)
                         This is all your fault.

               Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.

               EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

               The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically 
               through space.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is 
               watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.

                                     TARKIN
                         Are they away?

                                     VADER
                         They have just made the jump into 
                         hyperspace.

                                     TARKIN
                         You're sure the homing beacon is 
                         secure aboard their ship? I'm taking 
                         an awful risk, Vader. This had better 
                         work.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

               Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of 
               the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the 
               damage. Leia is seated near Han.

                                     HAN
                         Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You 
                         know, sometimes I even amaze myself.

                                     LEIA
                         That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, 
                         they let us go. It's the only 
                         explanation for the ease of our 
                         escape.

                                     HAN
                         Easy... you call that easy?

                                     LEIA
                         Their tracking us!

                                     HAN
                         Not this ship, sister.

               Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

                                     LEIA
                         At least the information in Artoo is 
                         still intact.

                                     HAN
                         What's so important? What's he 
                         carrying?

                                     LEIA
                         The technical readouts of that battle 
                         station. I only hope that when the 
                         data is analyzed, a weakness can be 
                         found. It's not over yet!

                                     HAN
                         It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't 
                         in this for your revolution, and I'm 
                         not in it for you, Princess. I expect 
                         to be well paid. I'm in it for the 
                         money!

                                     LEIA
                         You needn't worry about your reward. 
                         If money is all that you love, then 
                         that's what you'll receive!

               She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit, 
               passes Luke coming in.

                                     LEIA
                         Your friend is quite a mercenary. I 
                         wonder if he really cares about 
                         anything... or anyone.

                                     LUKE
                         I care!

               Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han 
               stare out at the vast blackness of space.

                                     LUKE
                         So... what do you think of her, Han?

                                     HAN
                         I'm trying not to, kid!

                                     LUKE
                              (under his breath)
                         Good...

                                     HAN
                         Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I 
                         don't know, what do you think? Do 
                         you think a princess and a guy like 
                         me...

                                     LUKE
                         No!

               Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at 
               young Luke's jealousy.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet 
               Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

               EXT. FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

               The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST

               An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.  
               He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely 
               visible in the foliage.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE

               Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple 
               lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the 
               fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the 
               others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

               Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored 
               military speeder.

               INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK

               The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set 
               up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the 
               commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and 
               gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

                                     WILLARD
                              (holding Leia)
                         You're safe! We had feared the worst.

               Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

                                     WILLARD
                         When we heard about Alderaan, we 
                         were afraid that you were... lost 
                         along with your father.

                                     LEIA
                         We don't have time for our sorrows, 
                         Commander. The battle station has 
                         surely tracked us here.
                              (looking pointedly to 
                              Han)
                         It's the only explanation for the 
                         ease of our escape. You must use the 
                         information in this R2 unit to plan 
                         the attack. It is our only hope.

               EXT. SPACE

               The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red 
               planet Yavin.

               INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

               Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their 
               discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer 
               the call.

                                     TARKIN
                         Yes.

               DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

               We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a 
               moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

               EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE

               A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape, 
               surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of 
               twisted green.

               INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

               Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia 
               and several other senators are to one side of the giant 
               readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots, 
               navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is 
               listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and 
               Chewbacca are standing near the back.

                                     DODONNA
                         The battle station is heavily shielded 
                         and carries a firepower greater than 
                         half the star fleet. It's defenses 
                         are designed around a direct large-
                         scale assault. A small one-man fighter 
                         should be able to penetrate the outer 
                         defense.

               Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands 
               and addresses Dodonna.

                                     GOLD LEADER
                         Pardon me for asking, sir, but what 
                         good are snub fighters going to be 
                         against that?

                                     DODONNA
                         Well, the Empire doesn't consider a 
                         small one-man fighter to be any 
                         threat, or they'd have a tighter 
                         defense. An analysis of the plans 
                         provided by Princess Leia has 
                         demonstrated a weakness in the battle 
                         station.

               Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping 
               sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

                                     DODONNA
                         The approach will not be easy. You 
                         are required to maneuver straight 
                         down this trench and skim the surface 
                         to this point. The target area is 
                         only two meters wide. It's a small 
                         thermal exhaust port, right below 
                         the main port. The shaft leads 
                         directly to the reactor system. A 
                         precise hit will start a chain 
                         reaction which should destroy the 
                         station.

               A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

                         Only a precise hit will set up a 
                         chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
                         shielded, so you'll have to use proton 
                         torpedoes.

               Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about 
               sixteen years old.

                         That's impossible, even for a 
                         computer.

                                     LUKE
                         It's not impossible. I used to bull's-
                         eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back 
                         home. They're not much bigger than 
                         two meters.

                                     DODONNA
                         Man your ships! And may the Force be 
                         with you!

               The group rises and begins to leave.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the 
               tiny green moon.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with 
               interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another 
               on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and 
               the forth moon.

                         This will be a day long remembered. 
                         It has seen the end of Kenobi and it 
                         will soon see the end of the 
                         Rebellion.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK

               Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship 
               hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.  
               Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and 
               unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this 
               activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes 
               onto an armored speeder.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         All flight trooper, man your stations. 
                         All flight troops, man your stations.

               Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter 
               pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of 
               his friend's departure.

                                     LUKE
                         So... you got your reward and you're 
                         just leaving then?

                                     HAN
                         That's right, yeah! I got some old 
                         debts I've got to pay off with this 
                         stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't 
                         think I'd be fool enough to stick 
                         around here, do you? Why don't you 
                         come with us? You're pretty good in 
                         a fight. I could use you.

                                     LUKE
                              (getting angry)
                         Come on! Why don't you take a look 
                         around? You know what's about to 
                         happen, what they're up against. 
                         They could use a good pilot like 
                         you. You're turning your back on 
                         them.

                                     HAN
                         What good's a reward if you ain't 
                         around to use it? Besides, attacking 
                         that battle station ain't my idea of 
                         courage. It's more like suicide.

                                     LUKE
                         All right. Well, take care of 
                         yourself, Han. I guess that's what 
                         you're best at, isn't it?

               Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

                                     HAN
                         Hey, Luke... may the Force be with 
                         you!

               Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in 
               a small wave and then goes off.

               Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

                                     HAN
                         What're you lookin' at? I know what 
                         I'm doing.

               INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

               Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

                                     LEIA
                         What's wrong?

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really 
                         thought he'd change his mind.

                                     LEIA
                         He's got to follow his own path. No 
                         one can choose it for him.

                                     LUKE
                         I only wish Ben were here.

               Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke 
               heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs 
               his arm.

                                     BIGGS
                         Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you 
                         get here... are you going out with 
                         us?!

                                     LUKE
                         Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there 
                         with you! Listen, have I got some 
                         stories to tell...

               Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up 
               behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born 
               leader.

                                     RED LEADER
                         Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you 
                         been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
                         five?

                                     BIGGS
                         Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in 
                         the outer rim territories.

               Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of 
               his fighter.

                                     RED LEADER
                         I met your father once when I was 
                         just a boy, he was a great pilot. 
                         You'll do all right. If you've got 
                         half of your father's skill, you'll 
                         do better than all right.

                                     LUKE
                         Thank you, sir. I'll try.

               Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

                                     BIGGS
                         I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll 
                         tell me your stories when we come 
                         back. All right?

                                     LUKE
                         I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

                                     BIGGS
                              (going off)
                         You did, all right. It's going to be 
                         like old times, Luke. We're a couple 
                         of shooting stars that'll never be 
                         stopped!

               Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for 
               his ship.

               As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly 
               spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points 
               to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the 
               back of the fighter.

                                     CHIEF
                         This R2 unit of your seems a bit 
                         beat up. Do you want a new one?

                                     LUKE
                         Not on your life! That little droid 
                         and I have been through a lot 
                         together.
                              (to Artoo)
                         You okay, Artoo?

               The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of 
               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps 
               that he is fine.

               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an 
               his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive 
               hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner 
               into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo 
               beeps good-bye.

                                     CHIEF
                         Okay, easy she goes!

                                     THREEPIO
                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to 
                         come back.

               Artoo beeps in agreement.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You wouldn't want my life to get 
                         boring, would you?

               Artoo whistles his reply.

               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  
               The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the 
               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The 
               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted 
               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses 
               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit 
               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, 
               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace 
               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Luke, the Force will be with you.

               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE

               All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing 
               on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The 
               muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this 
               eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion 
               rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage 
               in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud 
               cover.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly 
               before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its 
               four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves 
               ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear 
               around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills 
               the war room.

               The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface 
               of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying 
               in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.

               EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE

               Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow 
               around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in 
               formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly 
               pull away.

               The group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the 
               Death Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "X" 
               position.

               Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the 
               approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted 
               slightly.

               EXT. SPACE

               The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The 
               Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in 
               size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the 
               metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna 
               is built into the surface on one side.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome 
               spectacle.

               EXT. SPACE

               As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome 
               size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half 
               of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area 
               sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines 
               and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a 
               city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

                         now.

               INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

               Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming 
               in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in 
               the background. He moves his computer targeting device into 
               position.

                                     RED LEADER
                         We're in position. I'm going to cut 
                         across the axis and try and draw 
                         their fire.

               EXT. SPACE

               Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive 
               towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across 
               the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo- 
               powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate 
               the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting 
               devices.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
               wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death 
               Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and 
               fires.

               An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.

               Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous 
               fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit 
               window.

               Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak 
               from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on 
               the dim surface.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able 
               to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

               Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges 
               of his wings slightly scorched.

               Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. 
               Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.

                                     LUKE
                         I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

               Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface 
               with laserbolts.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in 
               all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.  
               Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and 
               foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes 
               up to him.

                         We'll have to destroy them ship to 
                         ship. Get the crews to their fighters.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their 
               turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes 
               about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head 
               gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming 
               noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet 
               with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

               Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon 
               and down onto the dim grey surface.

               EXT. LUKE'S X-WING TRAVELING

               A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the 
               onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements 
               erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on 
               the surface.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window 
               as a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of 
               his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers 
               his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from 
               the surface towards the heavens.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout 
               the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke 
               and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of 
               explosions.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and 
               gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A 
               dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small 
               auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.

               Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces 
               nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides 
               technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna 
               watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working

               The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches 
               the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

                         all this jamming, they'll be on top 
                         of you before your scope can pick 
                         them up.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon, 
               four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.  
               Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan 
               with the remaining two TIE ships.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The

               Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed 
               by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several 
               laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.

               INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward 
               the Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE 
               fighter, who sticks close to his tail.

               INT. X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to

               Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now 
               followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of 
               sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

               EXT. SURFACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the 
               Death Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the 
               background.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding

                         Hang on back there.

               Green laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his 
               head turns.

               Luke's ship soars closer to the surface of the Death Star, 
               an Imperial TIE fighter closing in on him in hot pursuit.

               INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

               The Death Star whips below Wedge.

               INT. TIE FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               The fighter pilot watches Wedge's X-wing approach. Another X-
               wing joins him, and both unleash a volley of laserfire on 
               the Imperial fighter.

               EXT. SPACE

               The TIE fighter explodes, filling the screen with white light.  
               Luke's ship can be seen far in the distance.

               Luke looks about in relief.

               Gold Leader approaches the surface and pulls out to skim the 
               surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep 
               trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as 
               laserfire is returned by the Death Star.

               INT. GOLD FIVE'S Y-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

               Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered 
               helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He 
               looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is 
               buffeted by Imperial flak.

               INT. GOLD LEADER'S Y-WING - COCKPIT

               Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the 
               exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing 
               numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to 
               bounce about.

               An exterior surface gun blazes away at the oncoming Rebel 
               fighters.

                         the surface, some on the towers.

               Leia, Threepio, and the technicians view the projected target 
               screen, as red and blue target lights glow. The red target 
               near the center blinks on and off.

               The three Y-wing fighters race toward camera and zoom overhead 
               through a hail of laserfire.

               INT. GOLD LEADER'S Y-WING - COCKPIT

               Gold Leader pulls his computer targeting device down in front 
               of his eye. Laserbolts continue to batter the Rebel craft.

               Gold Two, a younger pilot about Luke's age, pulls down his 
               targeting eye viewer and adjusts it. His ship shudders under 
               intense laser barrage.

                         Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

               As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly 
               all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench 
               as the surface whips past in a blur.

                                     GOLD TWO

                         and there is a danger. Should I have 
                         your ship standing by?

                                     TARKIN
                         Evacuate? In out moment of triumph? 
                         I think you overestimate their 
                         chances!

               Tarkin turns to the computer readout screen. Flames move 
               around the green disk at the center of the screen, as numbers

               Luke breaks into a nervous sweat as the laserfire is returned, 
               knicking one of his wings close to the engine.

               moment and ponders its use. He looks back into the computer 
               targeter.

               Solo, smiling, speaks to Luke over his headset mike.

                                     HAN
                              (into mike)
                         You're all clear, kid.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

               Leia and the others listen to Solo's transmission.

                                     HAN
                              (over speaker)
                         Now let's blow this thing and go 
                         home!

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke looks up and smiles. He concentrates on the exhaust 
               port, then fires his laser torpedoes.

               EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

               Luke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply 
               disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do 
               find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are 
               heading for the main reactor.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke throws his head back in relief.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               An Imperial soldier runs to the control panel board and pulls 
               the attack lever as the board behind him lights up.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Stand by to fire at Rebel base.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               Two X-wings, a Y-wing, and the pirateship race toward Yavin 
               in the distance.

               INT. DEATH STAR

               Several Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff 
               Tarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Standing by.

               The rumble of a distant explosion begins.

               EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

               The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like 
               Death Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small 
               flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a 
               supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.

               INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

                                     HAN
                         Great shot, kid. That was one in a 
                         million.

               INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

               Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.

                                     BEN'S VOICE
                         Remember, the Force will be with 
                         you... always.

               The ship rocks back and forth.

               EXT. DARTH VADER'S TIE FIGHTER

               Vader's ship spins off into space.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR

               Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a 
               throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder 
               as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. 
               Princess Leia rushes toward him.

                                     LEIA
                         Luke! Luke! Luke!

               She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance 
               around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace 
               one another, slapping each other on the back.

                                     HAN
                              (laughing)
                         Hey! Hey!

                                     LUKE
                              (laughing)
                         I knew you'd come back! I just knew 
                         it!

                                     HAN
                         Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all 
                         the credit and take all the reward.

               Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves 
               at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

                                     LEIA
                              (laughing)
                         Hey, I knew there was more to you 
                         than money.

               Luke looks toward the ship.

                                     LUKE
                         Oh, no!

               The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the 
               fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

                                     THREEPIO
                         Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say 
                         something!
                              (to mechanic)
                         You can repair him, can't you?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         We'll get to work on him right away.

                                     THREEPIO
                         You must repair him! Sir, if any of 
                         my circuits or gears will help, I'll 
                         gladly donate them.

                                     LUKE
                         He'll be all right.

               INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM

               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
               beeps with happiness.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               END CREDITS OVER STARS

                                         THE END
EXT. SPACE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

				There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
				Several hundred solar systems under
				the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
				Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
				secede from the Republic.

				This separatist movement has made it
				difficult for the limited number of
				Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
				order in the galaxy.

				Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
				Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
				to vote on the critical issue
				of creating an army to assist the
				overwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ 
			Cordé...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cordé's eyes are open. She looks up at her.

				CORDÉ
			... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... 

CORDÉ dies. PADMÉ hugs her.

				AMIDALA
			No!... No!... No!...

PADMÉ lowers CORDÉ to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

				AMIDALA
			I should not have come back.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			M'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			This vote is very important. You did
			your duty and Cordé did hers. Now
			come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
			please!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY 
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! We shall have order! The motion
			for the Republic to commission an army
			takes precedent, and that is what we
			will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.

				PALPATINE
			...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
			me... I have just received some
			tragic and disturbing news. Senator
			Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
			been assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

				PALPATINE
				(continued)
			This grievous blow is especially
			personal to me. Before I became
			Chancellor, I served Amidala when
			she was Queen. She was a great
			leader who fought for justice, not
			only in this honourable assembly,
			but also on her home planet. She
			was so loved she could have been
			elected queen for life. She
			believed in public service, and
			she fervently believed in
			democracy. Her death is a great
			loss to us all. We will all mourn
			her as a relentless champion of
			freedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			How many more Senators will die
			before this civil strife ends! We
			must confront these rebels now,
			and they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the 
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

				AMBASSADOR DARSANA
			Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
			this assassination? We are no
			longer safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

				ORN FREE TAA
			The Republic needs more security
			now! Before it comes to war.

				PALPATINE
			Must I remind the Senator from
			Malastare that negotiations are
			continuing with the separatists.
			Peace is our objective here... not
			war.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

				AMIDALA
			My noble colleagues, I concur with
			the Supreme Chancellor. At all
			costs, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and 
applause.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great surprise and
			joy the chair recognises the
			Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.

				PADMÉ
			Less than an hour ago, an
			assassination attempt was made
			against my life. One of my
			bodyguards and six  others were
			ruthlessly and senselessly
			murdered. I was the target but,
			more importantly, I believe this
			security measure before you, was
			the target. I have led the
			opposition to build an army... but
			there is someone in this body who
			will stop at nothing to assure it's
			passage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

				PADMÉ
			 	(continuing)
			I warn you, if you vote to create
			this army, war will follow. I
			have experienced the misery of war 
			first-hand; I do not wish to do it
			again.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

				PADMÉ
			Wake up, Senators... you must wake
			up! If you offer the separatists
			violence, they can only show us
			violence in return! Many will
			lose their lives. All will lose
			their freedom. This decision
			could very well destroy the very
			foundation of our great Republic.
			I pray you do not let fear push
			you into a disastrous decision.
			Vote down this security measure,
			which is nothing less than a
			declaration of war! Does anyone
			here want that? I cannot believe
			they do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

				ORN FREE TAA
			My motion to defer the vote must
			be dealt with first. That is the
			rule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.

				PALPATINE
			Due to the lateness of the hour
			and the seriousness of this
			motion, we will take up these
			matters tomorrow. Until then, the
			Senate stands adjourned.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY 
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

				PALPATINE
			I don't know how much longer I can
			hold off the vote, my friends.
			More and more star systems are
			joining the separatists.

				MACE WINDU
			If they do break away -

				PALPATINE
			No! I will not let that happen!

				MACE WINDU
			But if they do, you must realise
			there aren't enough Jedi to
			protect the Republic. We are
			keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

				PALPATINE
			Master Yoda, do you think it will
			really come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

				YODA
			Worse than war, I fear... Much
			worse. 

				PALPATINE
			What?

				MACE WINDU
			What do you sense, Master?

				YODA
			Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
			clouds everything. But this I am
			sure of -
				(opens his eyes)
			Do their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.

				DAR WAC
			The loyalist committee has arrived,
			my Lord. 

				PALPATINE
			Send them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

				YODA
			With you the force is strong...
			young Senator. To see you alive
			brings warm feeling to my heart.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
			have any idea who was behind
			the attack?

				MACE WINDU
			Our intelligence points to
			disgruntled spice miners, on
			the moons of Naboo.

				PADMÉ
			I don't wish to disagree but I
			think that Count Dooku was behind
			it.

There is a stir of surprise.

				MACE WINDU
			You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
			was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
			assassinate anyone, it is not in
			his character.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			He is a political idealist, not
			a murderer.

				YODA
			In dark times nothing is what it
			appears to be, but the fact remains
			Senator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku has always avoided
			any kind of conflict. It appears
			he has no desire to start a war.
			Why would he kill you? To what end?

				PADMÉ 
			I don't know, but everything in my
			being tells me he was behind it... 

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to 
Mace.

				PALPATINE
			Master Jedi, may I suggest that
			the Senator be placed under the
			protection of your graces.

				BAIL ORGANA
			Do you think that is a wise use
			of manpower during these stressful
			times?

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, if I may comment, I
			do not believe the...

				PALPATINE
			..."situation is that serious."
			No, but I do, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			Chancellor, please! I don't want
			any more guards!

				PALPATINE
			I realise all too well that
			additional security might be
			disruptive for you, but perhaps
			someone you are familiar with... an
			old friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

				MACE WINDU
			That's possible. He has just
			returned from a Border dispute on
			Ansion.

				PALPATINE
			You must remember him, M'Lady...
			he watched over you during the
			blockade conflict.

				PADMÉ
			This is not necessary, Chancellor.

				PALPATINE
			Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
			will rest easier. We had a big
			scare today. The thought of
			losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

				MACE WINDU
			I will have Obi-Wan report to you
			immediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

				YODA
			Too little about yourself you
			worry, Senator, and too much about
			politics. Be mindful of your
			danger, Padmé. Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.

				PALPATINE
			I will not like this Republiv, that
			has stood for over a thousand
			years, be split in two

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.

				JAR JAR
			Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
			to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

OBI-WAN smiles.

				OBI-WAN
			It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

				JAR JAR
			Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
			Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
			completely forgot myself for
			a moment there. I have had to learn
			Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
			native now. Don't really see the
			point, actually, but members of
			the Senate seem to prefer it...

JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			...and this, I take it, is your
			apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
			Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
				(Looks at Anakin)
			Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
			Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
			believen.

				ANAKIN
			Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

				JAR JAR
			Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

				JAR JAR
			Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
			dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
			myself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a great pleasure to see you again,
			M'Lady.

				PADMÉ
			It has been far too long Master
			Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
			have crossed again... but I must
			warn you that I think your
			presence here is unnecessary.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sure the Jedi Council have
			their reasons.

She moves in front of ANAKIN

				PADMÉ
			Annie??
				(stares)
			My goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

				ANAKIN
				(trying to be smooth)
			So have you... grown more
			beautiful, I mean... and much
			shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			Oh Annie, you'll always be that
			little boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.

				OBI-WAN
			Our presence will be invisible,
			M'Lady.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I am very grateful you are here,
			Master Kenobi. The situation is
			more dangerous than the Senator
			will admit.

				PADMÉ
			I don't need more security, I need
			answers. I want to know who is
			trying to kill me.

				OBI-WAN
				(frowning)
			We're here to protect you
			Senator, not to start an
			investigation.

				ANAKIN
			We will find out who is trying to
			kill you Padmé, I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going to exceed our
			mandate, my young Padawan learner.

				ANAKIN
			I meant in the interest of
			protecting her, Master, of course.

				OBI-WAN
			We are not going through this
			exercise again, Anakin. You will
			pay attention to my lead.

				ANAKIN
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			What??!!

				ANAKIN
			Why else do you think we were
			assigned to her, if not to find
			the killer? Protection is a job
			for local security... not Jedi.
			It's overkill, Master.
			Investigation is implied in our
			mandate.

				OBI-WAN
			We will do as the Council has
			instructed, and you will learn
			your place, young one.

				PADMÉ
			Perhaps with merely your presence,
			the mysteries surrounding this
			threat will be revealed.  Now if
			you will excuse me I will retire.

Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Well, I know I feel a lot better
			having you here.
			I'll have an officer on every
			floor and I'll be at the command
			centre downstairs.

				JAR JAR 
			Mesa busten wit happiness seein
			Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
			times, bombad times.

Captain Typho leaves.

				ANAKIN
			She didn't even recognise me, Jar
			Jar. I thought about her every
			day since we parted... and she's
			forgotten me completely.

				JAR JAR
			Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
			see-en her in longo time.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you're focusing on the
			Negative again. Be mindful of your
			thoughts. She was glad to see us.
			Now lets check the security here.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, my master.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.

				MACE WINDU
			Why couldn't we see this attack on
			the Senator?

				YODA
			Masking the future, is this
			disturbance in the Force.

				MACE WINDU
			The propecy is coming true, the
			Dark Side is growing.

				YODA
			And only those who have turned to
			the Dark Side can sense the
			possibilities of the future. Only
			going through the Dark Side can we
			see.

				MACE WINDU
			It's been ten years, and the Sith
			still have no shown themselves.
			Do you think they are behind this?

				YODA
			...Out there, they are. A
			certainty that is.

				MACE WINDU
			Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
			will be able to bring balance to
			the Force?

				YODA
			Only if he chooses to follow his
			destiny.

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

				OBI-WAN
			Captain Typho has more than enough
			men downstairs. No assassin will
			try that way. Any activity up
			here?

				ANAKIN
			Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
			just waiting here for something to
			happen to her.

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.

				OBI-WAN
			What's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

				ANAKIN
			She covered that camera. I don't
			think she liked me watching her.

				OBI-WAN
			What is she thinking?

				ANAKIN
			She programmed Artoo to warn us if
			there's an intruder.

				OBI-WAN
			It's not an intruder I'm worried
			about. There are many other ways
			to kill a Senator.

				ANAKIN
			I know, but we also want to catch
			this assassin. Don't we, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			You're using her as bait??

				ANAKIN
			It was her idea... No harm will
			come to her. I can sense
			everything going on in that room.
			Trust me.

				OBI-WAN
			It's too risky... and your senses
			aren't that attuned, young
			apprentice.

				ANAKIN
			And yours are?

				OBI-WAN
			Possibly.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.

				OBI-WAN 
			You look tired.

				ANAKIN
			I don't sleep well, anymore.

				OBI-WAN 
			Because of your mother?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know why I keep dreaming
			About her now. I haven't seen her
			since I was little.

				OBI-WAN
			Dreams pass in time.

				ANAKIN
			I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just
			Being around her again is...
			intoxicating.

				OBI-WAN
			Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
			betray you. You've made a
			commitment to the Jedi order... a
			commitment not easily broken...
			and don't forget she's a
			politician. They're not to be
			trusted.

				ANAKIN 
			She's not like the others in the
			Senate, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			It's been my experience that
			Senators are only focused on
			pleasing those who fund their
			campaigns... and they are more
			than willing to forget the
			niceties of democracy to get those
			funds.

				ANAKIN
			Not another lecture, Master. Not
			on the economics of politics....
			It's too early in the morning... and
			besides, you're generalising. The
			Chancellor doesn't appear to
			be corrupt.

				OBI-WAN
			Palpatine's a politician, I've
			observed that he is very clever at
			following the passions and
			prejudices of the Senators.

				ANAKIN
			I think he is a good man. My
			instincts are very positive
			about...

ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN

				OBI-WAN
			I sense it, too.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.

				ANAKIN
			Stay here!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. 

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

				ANAKIN
			That was wacky! I almost lost you
			in the traffic.

				OBI-WAN
			What took you so long?

				ANAKIN
			Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
			find a speeder I really liked,
			with an open cockpit... and with
			the right speed capabilities...
			and then you know I had to get a
			really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.

				OBI-WAN
			If you'd spend as much time
			working on your saber skills as
			you do on your wit, young Padawan,
			you would rival Master Yoda as a
			swordsman.

				ANAKIN
			I thought I already did.

				OBI-WAN
			Only in your mind, my very young
			apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, I forgot you don't like
			flying, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't mind flying... but
			what you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

				ANAKIN
			Master, you know I've been flying
			since before I could walk. I'm very
			good at this.

				OBI-WAN
			Just slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Wait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			You know I don't like it when you
			do that!

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
			guy's gonna kill himself any
			minute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			What are you doing? He's gonna
			blast me!

				ANAKIN
			Right - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

				OBI-WAN
			That was too close!

				ANAKIN
			Clear that!

				OBI-WAN
			What??

				ANAKIN
			Clear the flag! We're losing
			power! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.

				OBI-WAN
			Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
			don't  like it when you do that!

				ANAKIN
			So sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

				OBI-WAN
			It's dangerous near those power
			couplings! Slow down! Don't go
			through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Yiiii, what are you doing?

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master!

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastically)
			Oh, that was good...

				ANAKIN
			That was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Ahh, damn.

				OBI-WAN
			Stop!!

				ANAKIN
			No, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

				OBI-WAN
			I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
			crazy.

				ANAKIN
			But it worked... we made it.

				OBI-WAN
				(angrily)
			It didn't work... we've stalled!
			And you almost got us killed!

				ANAKIN
			I think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

				OBI-WAN
				(very angrily)
			It was stupid!

				ANAKIN
				(sheepishly)
			I could have made it...

				OBI-WAN
				(furious)
			But you didn't!!! And now we've
			lost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

				ANAKIN
			No we didnt...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

				OBI-WAN
			Where are you going?! He went
			down there, the other way.

				ANAKIN
			This is a shortcut... I think.

				OBI-WAN
			What do you mean, You think?
			What kind of shortcut?! He went
			completely the other way! Youve
			lost him!

				ANAKIN
			Master, if we keep this chase
			going, that creeps gonna end up
			deep fried. Personally, Id very
			much like to find out who in the
			hell he is and who hes working
			for...

				OBI-WAN
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, so thats why were going in
			the wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Well, you lost him.

				ANAKIN
			Im deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to 
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Excuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunters speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM cant reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengers seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAMS hand. She grabs the Jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunters speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

				ANAKIN
			She went into that club, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			Patience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

				OBI-WAN
			 	(continuing)
			Here. Next time try not to lose it.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

				OBI-WAN
			A Jedi's saber is his most
			precious possession.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

				OBI-WAN
			He must keep it with him at all
			times.

				ANAKIN
			I know, Master.

				OBI-WAN
			This weapon is your life!

				ANAKIN
			I've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

				OBI-WAN
			But, you haven't learned anything,
			Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			I try, Master.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them

				OBI-WAN
			Why do I think you are going to be
			the death of me?!

				ANAKIN
			Don't say that Master... You're
			the closest thing I have to a
			father... I love you. I don't want
			to cause you pain.

				OBI-WAN
			Then why don't you listen to me?!

				ANAKIN
			I will. I'll do better, I promise.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you see him him?

				ANAKIN
			I think he's a she...

				OBI-WAN
			Then be extra careful...
				(nods to a room)
			Check it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

				ANAKIN
			Where are you going, Master?

				OBI-WAN
			To get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

				ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
			Wanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

				OBI-WAN
			You don't want to sell me death-
			sticks.

				ELAN
			I don't want to sell you death-
			sticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

				OBI-WAN
			You want to go home and rethink 
			your life.

				ELAN
			I want to go home and rethink my
			life.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

				ANAKIN
			Easy... Official business. Go
			back to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know who it was you were
			trying to kill?

				ZAM WESSEL
			The Senator from Naboo.

				OBI-WAN
			Who hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

				ZAM WESSEL
			It was just a job.

				ANAKIN
			Tell us!

				ZAM WESSEL
			That Senator's gonna die soon
			anyway, and the next one won't
			make the same mistake I did...

				OBI-WAN
			This wound's going to need
			treatment.

				ANAKIN
			Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
			now!

ZAM glares hatefully.

				ZAM
			It was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.

				OBI-WAN
			Toxic Dart...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S 
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.

				PADMÉ
			Representative Binks. I know I can
			count on you.

				JAR JAR
			Yousa betchen mesa bottums.

				PADMÉ
			What?!

				JAR JAR
				(coughs, recovers)
			Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
			I am honoured to accept this heavy
			burden. I take on this
			responsibility with deep humility
			tinged with an overwhelming pride.
				(pompously)
			It is not every day that I am
			called upon to...

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

				PADMÉ
			You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
			don't wish to hold you up. I'm
			sure you have a great deal to do.

				JAR JAR
			Of course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

				PADMÉ
			I do not like this idea of hiding.

				ANAKIN
			Don't worry. Now that the Council
			has ordered an investigation, it
			won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
			find that bounty hunter.

				PADMÉ
				(frustrated)
			I haven't worked for a year to
			defeat the "Military Creation Act"
			not to be here when its fate is
			decided.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes we have to let go of our
			pride and do what is requested of
			us.

				PADMÉ
			Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
			you don't have a very firm grip on
			politics. I suggest you reserve
			your opinions for some other time.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
			to...

				PADMÉ
			Annie! No!

				ANAKIN
			Please don't call me that.

				PADMÉ
			What?

				ANAKIN
			Annie...

				PADMÉ
			I've always called you that... it
			is your name, isn't it?

				ANAKIN
			It's Anakin. When you say Annie
			it's like I'm still a little
			boy... and I'm not.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
			to deny you've...
				(looks him over)
			...that you've grown up.

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

				ANAKIN
			Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
			it...

				PADMÉ
			Mentors have a way of seeing more
			of our faults than we would like.
			It's the only way we grow.

				ANAKIN
			Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
			a great mentor. As wise as Master
			Yoda and as powerful as Master
			Windu. I am truly thankful to be
			his apprentice. Only... although
			I'm a Padawan learner, in some
			ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
			of him. I'm ready for the trials.
			I know I am! He knows it too. He
			believes I'm too unpredictable...
			Other Jedi my age have gone
			through the trials and made it...
			I know I started my training
			late... but he won't let me move
			on.

				PADMÉ
			That must be frustrating.

				ANAKIN
			It's worse... he's overly
			critical. He never listens! He
			just doesn't understand! It's not
			fair!

PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.

				PADMÉ
			I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
			like that little boy I once knew,
			when he didn't get his way.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not whining! I'm not.

PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.

				PADMÉ
			I didn't say it to hurt you.

				ANAKIN
			I know...

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Anakin...

They look into each other's eyes for the first time.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Don't try to grow up too fast.

				ANAKIN
			I am grown up. You said it
			yourself.

ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.

				PADMÉ
			Please don't look at me like that.

				ANAKIN
			Why not?

				PADMÉ
			Because I can see what you're
			thinking.

				ANAKIN
				(laughing)
			Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
			too?

DORME is watching with concern.

				PADMÉ
			It makes me feel uncomfortable.

				ANAKIN
			Sorry, M'lady.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY 
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			Be safe, m'lady.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Captain. Take good
			care of Dorme... the threat's on
			you two now.

				DORME
			He'll be safe with me.

They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.

				PADMÉ
			You'll be fine.

				DORME
			It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
			about you. What if they realise
			I'm not you?

				PADMÉ
				(looks to Anakin)
			Then my Jedi protector will have
			to prove how grown up he is.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
			Do not attract any attention. Do
			absolutely nothing without
			checking in with me or the Council.

				ANAKIN
			Yes, Master.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Padme)
			I will get to the bottom of this
			plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
			back here in no time.

				PADMÉ
			I will be most grateful for your
			speed, Master Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Time to go.

				PADMÉ
			I know. 

PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.

				OBI-WAN
			May the Force be with you.

				ANAKIN
			May the Force be with you, Master.

They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.

				PADMÉ
			Suddenly, I'm afraid...

				ANAKIN
			I'm kinda scared too. This is my
			first assignment on my own.

				PADMÉ
			There's nothing to worry about...
			we have Artoo with us.

The two laugh.

OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the 
vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.

				OBI-WAN
			I hope he doesn't try anything
			foolish.

				CAPTAIN TYPHO
			I'd be more concerned about her
			doing something, than him.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

				PK-4
			Place the subject for analysis on
			the sensot tray, please.

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.

				OBI-WAN
			It's a toxic dart. I need to know
			where it came from and who made it.

				PK-4
			One moment, please.

Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.

				PK-4
				(continuing)
			As you can see on your screen,
			subject weapon does not exist in
			any known culture. Markings
			cannot be identified. Probablt
			self-made by a warrior not
			associated with any known society.

				OBI-WAN
			Excuse me? Could you try again
			please?

				PK-4
			Master Jedi, our records are very
			thorough. they cover eight
			percent of the galaxy. If I can't
			tell you where it came from,
			nobody can.

OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.

				OBI-WAN
			Thanks for your assistance! You
			may not be able to figure this
			out, but I think I know someone
			who might.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

				SERVER
			Keep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

				FOOD SERVER
				(continuing)
			Hey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

				ANAKIN
			No, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			What?

				PADMÉ
			You seemed to be having a
			nightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

				PADMÉ
				(continuing)
			Are you hungry?

				ANAKIN
			Thank you.

				PADMÉ
			We went into lightspeed a while
			ago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

				ANAKIN
			I look forward to seeing Naboo
			again. I've thought about it every
			day since I left. It's by far the
			most beautiful place I've ever
			seen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare. 

				PADMÉ
			You were just a little boy then.
			It may not be as you remember it;
			time changes your perception.

				ANAKIN
			I think time has given me much
			more mature feelings to enhance my
			perception.

				PADMÉ
			It must be difficult having sworn
			your life to the Jedi... not being
			able to visit the places you
			like... or do the things you
			like...

				ANAKIN
			Or be with the people I love.

				PADMÉ
			Are you allowed to love? I
			thought that was forbidden for a
			Jedi.

				ANAKIN
			Attachment is forbidden.
			Possession is forbidden.
			Compassion, which I would define
			as unconditional love, is central
			to a Jedi's life, so you might say
			we're encouraged to love.

				PADMÉ
			You have changed so much

				ANAKIN
			You haven't changed a bit. You're
			exactly the way I remember you in
			my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
			changed much either.

				PADMÉ
			It hasn't...

				ANAKIN
			I can't wait to breathe the sweet
			breeze that comes off the rolling
			hills. Whenever I try to
			visualise the Force, those hills
			are what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

				PADMÉ
				(changing the subject)
			Were you dreaming about you
			mother earlier, weren't you?

				ANAKIN
			Yes... I left Tatooine so long
			ago, my memory of her is fading.
			I don't want to lose it. Recently
			I've been seeing her in my
			dreams... vivid dreams... scary
			dreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

				HERMIONE
			Can I help ya?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Waddya want him for?

				OBI-WAN
			He's not in trouble. It's
			personal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			Someone to see ya, honey
				(lowering her voice)
			A Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Take a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

				HERMIONE BAGWA
			You want a cup of ardees?

				OBI-WAN
			Thank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Hey, ol' buddy!

				OBI-WAN
			Hey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			So, my friend. What can I do for
			ya?

				OBI-WAN
			You can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			Well, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
				(continuing)
			I ain't seen one of these since I
			was prospecting on Subterrel
			beyond the Outer Rim!

				OBI-WAN
			Do you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			This baby belongs to them cloners.
			What you got here is a Kamino
			Kyberdart.

				OBI-WAN
			Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
			it didn't show up in any analysis
			archive.

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It's these funny little cuts on
			the side give it away...
			Those analysis droids you've got
			over there only focus on symbols,
			you know. I should think you Jedi
			would have more respect for the
			difference between knowledge and
			wisdom.

				OBI-WAN
			Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
			wouldn't be here, would we?
				(laughing)
			Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
			Is it part of the Republic?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
			I'd say about twelve parsecs
			outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
			south. It should be easy to find,
			even for those droids in your
			archive to find. Those Kaminoans
			keep to themselves. They're
			cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

				OBI-WAN
			Cloners? Are they friendly?

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			It depends.

				OBI-WAN
			On what, Dex?

Dexter grins. 

				DEXTER JETTSTER
			On how good your manners are...
			and how big your pocketbook is...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

				ANAKIN
			If I grew up here, I don't think
			I'd ever leave.

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			I doubt that.

				ANAKIN
			No, really. When I started my
			training, I was very homesick and
			very lonely. This city and my Mom
			were the only pleasant things I
			had to think about... The problem
			was, the more I thought about my
			Mom, the worse I felt. But I
			would feel better if I thought
			about the palace - the way it
			shimmers in the sunlight - the way
			the air always smells of flowers...

				PADMÉ
			...and the soft sound of the
			distant waterfalls. The first
			time I saw the Capital, I was very
			young... I'd never seen a
			waterfall before. I though they
			were so beautiful... I never
			dreamed one day I'd live in the
			palace.

				ANAKIN
			Well, tell me, did you dream of
			power and politics when you were
			a little girl?

				PADMÉ
				(laughing)
			No! That was the last thing I
			thought of. My dream was to help
			in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
			I never thought of running for
			elected office. But the more
			history I studied, the more I
			realised how much good politicians
			could do. So when I was eight, I
			joined the "Apprentice
			Legislators", then later on became
			a Senatorial advisor, with such a
			passion that, before I knew it, I
			was elected Queen. Partly because
			I scored so high on my education
			certificate, but for the most part
			it was my conviction that reform
			was possible. I wasn't the
			youngest Queen ever elected, but
			now that I think back on it, I'm
			not sure I was old enough. I'm not
			sure I was ready.

				ANAKIN
			The people you served thought you
			did a good job. I heard they
			tried to amend the Constitution so
			you could stay in office.

				PADMÉ
			Popular rule is not democracy,
			Annie. It gives the people what
			they want, not what they need.
			And, truthfully, I was relieved
			when my two terms were up. So
			were my parents. They worried
			About me during the blockade and
			couldn't wait for it all to be
			over. Actually, I was hoping to
			have a family by now... My
			sisters have the most amazing,
			wonderful kids... but when the
			Queen asked me to serve as
			Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

				ANAKIN
			I agree! I think the Republic
			needs you... I'm glad you chose
			to serve. I feel things are going
			to happen in our generation that
			will change the galaxy in profound
			ways.

				PADMÉ
			I think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We've been worried about you.
				(takes her hand)
			I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.

				PADMÉ
			Thank you, Your Highness. I only
			Wish I could have served you
			better by staying on Coruscant for
			the vote.

				SIO BIBBLE
			Given the circumstances, Senator,
			you know it was the only decision
			Her Highness could have made.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			How many systems have joined Count
			Dooku and the separatists?

				PADMÉ
			About two hundred. And more are
			leaving the Republic every day.
			If the Senate votes to create an
			army, I'm sure it's going to push
			us into a civil war.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's unthinkable! There hasn't
			been a full-scale war since the
			formation of the Republic!

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Do you see any way, through
			negotiations, to bring the
			separatists back into the Republic?

				PADMÉ
			Not if they feel threatened. The
			separatists don't have an army,
			but if they are provoked, they
			will move to defend themselves.
			I'm sure of that. And with no time
			or money to build an army, my
			guess is they will turn to the
			Commerce Guilds or the Trade
			Federation for help.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			The armies of commerce! Why has
			Nothing been done in the Senate
			to restrain them?

				PADMÉ
			I'm afraid that, despite the
			Chancellor's best efforts, there
			are still many bureaucrats,
			judges, and even Senators on the
			payrolls of the Guilds.

				SIO BIBBLE
			It's outrageous! After all of
			those hearings, and the four trials in
			the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
			still the Viceroy of the Trade
			Federation. Do those money
			mongers control everything?

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Remember, Counsellor, the courts
			were able to reduce the
			Federation's armies. That's a
			move in the right
			direction.

				PADMÉ
			There are rumours, Your Highness,
			that the Federation Army was not
			reduced as they were ordered.

				ANAKIN
			The Jedi have not been allowed to
			investigate. It would be to be too
			dangerous for the economy, we were
			told.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			We must keep our faith in the
			Republic. The day we stop
			believing democracy can work is
			the day we lose it.

				PADMÉ
			Let's pray that day never comes.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			In the meantime, we must consider
			your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin)
			What is your suggestion, Master
			Jedi?

				PADMÉ
			Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
			He's still a Padawan learner. I
			was thinking...

				ANAKIN
				(nettled)
			Hey, hold on a minute!

				PADMÉ
			Excuse me! I was thinking I would
			stay in the Lake Country. There
			are some places up there that are
			very isolated.

				ANAKIN
			Excuse me?! I am in charge of
			security here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.

				PADMÉ
			Annie, my life is at risk, and
			this is my home. I know it very
			well... that is why we're here.
			I think it would be wise for you
			to take advantage of my knowledge
			in this instance.

				ANAKIN
				(takes a deep breath)
			Sorry, M'Lady.

				SIO BIBBLE
				(to Anakin, amused)
			She is right. The Lake Country is
			the most remote part of Naboo.
			Not many people and a clear view
			of the surrounding terrain.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
			Perfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.

				QUEEN JAMILLIA
				(continued)
			Padmé, I had an audience with your
			father yesterday. I told him what
			was happening. He hopes you will
			visit your mother before you
			leave... your family's very
			worried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

				JOCASTA NU
			Did you call for assistance?

				OBI-WAN
				(distracted in thought)
			Yes... yes, I did...

				JOCASTA NU
			He has a powerful face, doesn't
			he? He was one of the most
			brilliant Jedi I have had the
			privilege of knowing.

				OBI-WAN
			I never understood why he quit.
			Only twenty Jedi have ever left
			the Order.

				JOCASTA NU
				(sighs)
			The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
			was the most recent and the most
			painful. No one likes to talk
			about it. His leaving was a great
			loss to the Order.

				OBI-WAN
			What happened?

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, one might say, he was always
			a bit out of step with the
			decisions of the Council... much
			like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

				OBI-WAN
				(surprised)
			Really?

				JOCASTA NU
			Oh, yes. They were alike in many
			ways. Very individual thinkers...
			idealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing
			He was always striving to become
			a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
			to be the best. With a lightsaber,
			in the old style of fencing, he
			had no match. His knowledge of
			the Force was... unique. In the
			end, I think he left because he
			lost faith in the Republic. He
			believed that politics were
			corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
			betrayed themselves by serving the
			politicians. He always had very
			high expectations of government.
			He disappeared for nine or ten
			years, then he just showed up
			recently as the head of the
			separatist movement.

				OBI-WAN
			Interesting... I'm still not sure
			I understand.

				JOCASTA NU
			Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
			over here for a history lesson.
			Are you having a problem, Master
			Kenobi?

				OBI-WAN
			Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
			system called Kamino. It doesn't
			seem to show upon any of the
			archive charts.

				JOCASTA NU
			Kamino? It's not a system I'M
			familiar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

				JOCASTA NU
				(continuing)
			Are you sure you have the right
			co-ordinates?

				OBI-WAN
				(nodding)
			According to my information, it
			should be in this quadrant
			somewhere... just south of the
			Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

				JOCASTA NU
			No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
			kind of directions you'd get from
			a street tout... some old miner or
			Furbog trader.

				OBI-WAN
			All three actually.

				JOCASTA NU
			Are you sure it exists?

				OBI-WAN
			Absolutely.

				JOCASTA NU
			Let me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

				JOCASTA NU
			There are some inconsistencies
			here. Maybe the planet you're
			looking for was destroyed.

				OBI-WAN
			Wouldn't that be on record?

				JOCASTA NU
			It ought to be. Unless it was very
			recent.
				(shakes her head)
			I hate to say it, but it looks
			like the system you're searching
			for doesn't exist.

				OBI-WAN
			That's impossible... perhaps the
			archives are incomplete.

				JOCASTA NU
			The archives are comprehensive and
			totally secure, my young Jedi.
			One thing you may be absolutely
			sure of - if an item does not
			appear in our records, it does not
			exist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

				PADME
			There's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			What? Don't say you're shy!

				ANAKIN
				(untruthfully)
			No, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

				RYOO & POOJA
			Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

				PADME
			Ryoo!! Pooja!!

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			I'm so happy to see you! This is
			Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
			this is Pooja.

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

				RYOO & POOJA
			Artoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.

				SOLA
				(over her shoulder)
			They're eating over at Jev
			Narran's later, Mom. They just
			had a snack. They'll be fine.

SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.

				PADME
			Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

				SOLA
			Hello, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			Hello.

SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.

				JOBAL
			You're just in time for dinner. I
			hope you're hungry, Anakin.

				ANAKIN
			A little.

				PADME
			He's being polite, Mom. We're
			starving.

				RUWEE
				(grinning)
			You came to the right place at the
			right time. Sit down, son.

EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.

				JOBAL
				(to Padme)
			Honey, it's so good to see you
			safe. We were so worried.

PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.

				RUWEE
			Dear...

				JOBAL
			I know, I know... but I had to say
			it. Now it's done.

				SOLA
			Well, this is exciting! Do you
			know, Anakin, you're the first
			boyfriend my sister's ever brought
			home?

				PADME
				(rolls her eyes)
			Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
			He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
			to protect me.

				JOVAL
			A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
			didn't tell us it was that serious!

				PADME
			It's not, Mom, I promise.
				(glances at Jobal)
			Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
			known him for years. Remember
			that little boy who was with the
			Jedi during the blockade crisis?

They nod.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			He grew up.

				JOBAL
			Honey, when are you going to
			settle down? Haven't you had
			enough of that life? I certainly
			have!

				PADME
			Mom, I'm not in any danger.

				RUWEE
				(to Anakin)
			Is she?

				ANAKIN
			...Yes... I'm afraid she is.

				PADME
				(quickly)
			But not much.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.

				RUWEE
			Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
			more... but I must say, I'm happy
			here.

				ANAKIN
			Padme tells me you teach at the
			university?

				RUWEE
				(nodding)
			Yes, and before that, I was a
			builder. I also worked for the
			Refugee Relief Movement, when I
			was very young.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.

				SOLA
			Why haven't you told us about him?

				PADMÉ
			What's there to talk about?  He's
			just a boy.

				SOLA
			A boy? Have you seen the way he
			looks at you?

				PADMÉ
			Sola - stop it!

				SOLA
			It's obvious he has feelings for
			you. Are you saying, little baby
			sister, that you haven't noticed?

				PADMÉ
			I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
			Anakin and I are friends... our
			relationship is strictly
			professional.
				(to Jobal)
			Mom, would you tell her to stop it?

				SOLA
				(laughing)
			Well, maybe you haven't noticed
			the way he looks at you. I think
			you're afraid to.

				PADMÉ
			Cut it out.

				JOBAL
			Sola's just concerned... we all
			are.

				PADMÉ
			Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
			I'm doing is important.

				JOBAL
			You've done your service, Padmé.
			It's time you had a life of your
			own. You're missing so much!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN directly.

				RUWEE
			Now tell me, son. How serious is
			this thing? How much danger is my
			daughter really in?

				ANAKIN
			There have been two attempts on
			her life. Chances are there'll be
			more. My Master is tracking down
			the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
			out who they are. This situation,
			won't last long.

				RUWEE
			I don't want anything to happen to
			her.

				ANAKIN
			I don't either.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME throws some things into a bag.

				PADME
			Don't worry, this won't take long.

				ANAKIN
			I just want to get there before
			dark.

PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			You still live at home.

				PADME
			I move around so much, I've never
			had a place of my own. Official
			residences have no warmth. I feel
			good here. I feel at home.

				ANAKIN
			I never had a real home. Home was
			always where my Mom was.

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Is this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.

				PADME
			That was when I went with the
			Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
			Their sun was imploding, and the
			planet was dying. I was helping
			to relocate the children. See
			that little one I'm holding? His
			name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
			sweethear. He was so full of 
			life,. All those kids were. I did
			everything I could to save him,
			but he died... they all did. They
			were never able to adapt... to
			live off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			My first day as an Apprentice
			Legislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

				YODA
			Don't think... feel... be as one
			with the Force. Help you, it will.
				(he sees Obi-Wan)
			Younglings - enough! A visitor we
			have. Welcome him.

The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
			mighty Bear Clan.

				CHILDREN
			Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!

				OBI-WAN
			I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

				YODA
			What help to you, can I be?

				OBI-WAN
			Im looking for a planet described
			to me by an old friend. I trust
			him. But the system doesnt show
			up on the archive maps.

				YODA
			An interesting puzzle. Gather
			round the map reader, younglings.
			Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
			Find it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

				OBI-WAN
			This is where it ought to be...
			but it isnt. Gravity is pulling
			all the stars in this area inward
			to this spot. There should be a
			star here... but there isnt.

				YODA
			Most interesting. Gravitys
			silhouette remains, but the star
			and all its planets have
			disappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

				JEDI CHILD JACK
			Because someone erased it from the
			archive memory.

				CHILDREN
			Thats right! Yes! Thats what
			happened! Someone erased it!

				JEDI CHILD MAY
			If the planet blew up, the gravity
			would go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

				YODA
			Truly wonderful, the mind of a
			child is. Uncluttered. To the
			centre of the pull of gravity go,
			and find your planet you will.

				OBI-WAN
			But Master Yoda who could have
			erased information from the
			archives? Thats impossible,
			isnt it?

				YODA
				(frowning)
			Much harder to answer, that
			question is.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.

				PADMÉ
			When I was in Level Three, we used
			to come here for school retreat.
			See that island? We used to swim
			there every day. I love the water.

				ANAKIN
			I do too. I guess it comes from
			growing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

				PADMÉ
			...We used to lie on the sand and
			let the sun dry us... and try to
			guess the names of the birds
			singing.

				ANAKIN
			I dont like sand. Its coarse
			and rough and irritating, and it
			gets everywhere. Not like here.
			Here everythings soft... and
			smooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.

				PADMÉ
			There was a very old man who lived
			on the island. He used to make
			glass out of sand - and vases and
			necklaces out of the glass. They
			were magical.

				ANAKIN
				(looks into her eyes)
			Everything here is magical.

				PADMÉ
			You could look into the glass and
			see the water. The way it ripples
			and moves. It looked so real...
			but it wasnt.

				ANAKIN
			Sometimes, when you believe
			something to be real, it becomes
			real. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

				PADMÉ
			I used to think if you looked too
			deeply into glass, you would
			lose yourself.

				ANAKIN
			I think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.

				PADMÉ
			I shouldn't have done that.

				ANAKIN
			I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
			my mind is no longer my own.

				PADMÉ
			It's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.

				MACE WINDU
			Be wary, this disturbance in the
			Force is growing stronger.

				OBI-WAN
			I am concerned for my Padawan. He
			is not ready to be on his own.

				YODA
			The Council is confident in this decision,
			Obi-Wan.

				MACE
			He has exceptional skills. The
			Council is confident in its
			decision, Obi-Wan. If the
			prophecy is true, he weill be the
			one to bring balance to the Force.

				OBI-WAN
			But he still has much to learn.
			And his abilities have made him...
			well... arrogant. I realise now
			what you and Master Yoda knew from
			the beginning... the boy was too
			old to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

				MACE WINDU
			There's something else?

				OBI-WAN
			Master, he should not have been
			given this assignment. I'm afraid
			Anakin won't be able to protect
			the Senator. 

				MACE WINDU
			Why?

				OBI-WAN
			He has a... an emotional
			connection with her. It's been
			there since he was boy. Now
			he's confused... distracted.

				MACE-WINDU
			Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
			he will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

				OBI-WAN
			Has Master Yoda gained any insight
			into whether or not this war will
			come about?

				MACE WINDU
			Probing the Dark Side is a
			dangerous process. He could be in
			seclusion for days... May the
			force be with you.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

				PADME
			You did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

				ANAKIN
			What?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

				PADME
			That! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			Anakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

				ANAKIN
			I'm not really supposed to do
			that... for fun, I mean. If
			Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
			very grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

				ANAKIN
			May I tell you something?

				PADME
			I don't know.

				ANAKIN
			Then how can I tell you?

				PADME
			Maybe you should use your Jedi
			intuition.

				ANAKIN
			It doesn't work around you. My
			mind is always a muddle... I can
			only think of you.

				PADME
			Anakin, don't...

				ANAKIN
			From the moment I met you, all
			those years ago, a day hasn't gone
			by when I haven't thought of you.
			And now that I'm close to you again,
			I'm in agony. The closer I get to
			you, the worse it gets. The
			thought of not being with you
			mskes my stomach turn over - my
			mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
			can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
			kiss you should never have given
			me. My heart is beating, hoping
			that kiss will not become a scar.
			You are in my very soul,
			tormenting me. What can I do? I
			will do anything you ask...

Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			If you are suffering as much as I
			am, tell me.

				PADME
			...I can't. We can't. It's just
			not possible.

				ANAKIN
			Anything's possible. Padme,
			please listen...

				PADME
			You listen. We live in a real
			world. Come back to it. You're
			studying to become a Jedi Knight.
			I'm a Senator. If you follow your
			thoughts through to conclusion,
			they will take us to a place we
			cannot go... regardless of the way
			we feel about each other.

				ANAKIN
			Then you do feel something!
			There's an extraordinary
			connection between us. You can't
			deny that.

				PADME
			Annie, it doesn't make any
			difference. Jedi aren't allowed
			to marry. You swore an oath,
			remember? You'd be expelled from
			the Order. I will not let you
			give up your responsibilities...
			your future, for me.

				ANAKIN
			I was destined to be a Jedi. I
			don't think I could be anything
			else. But you are asking me to be
			rational. That is something I
			know I cannot do. I wish I could
			wish my feelings away... but I
			can't.

				PADME
			I am not going to give into this.
			I'm not going to throw my life
			away. I have more important things
			to do than fall in love.

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

				ANAKIN
			It wouldn't have to be that way...
			we could keep it a secret.

				PADME
			Then we'd be living a lie - one we
			couldn't keep even if we wanted
			to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
			mother. I couldn't do that.
			Could you, Anakin? Could you live
			like that?

Silence for a moment.

				ANAKIN
			...No, you're right. It would
			destroy us.

EXT. SPACE
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
			Jedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

				TAUN WE
			Everything is ready. The Prime
			Minister expects you.

				OBI-WAN
				(warily)
			I'm expected?

				TAUN WE
			Of course! He is anxious to see
			you. After all these years, we
			were beginning to think you
			weren't coming. Now please, this
			way!

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.

				TAUN WE
			May I present Lama Su, Prime
			Minister of Kamino... and this is
			Master Jedi...

				OBI-WAN
			Obi-Wan Kenobi.

				LAMA SU
			Please...

LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.

				LAMA SU
			I trust you are going to enjoy
			your stay. We are most happy you
			have arrived at the best part of
			the season.

				OBI-WAN
			You make me feel most welcome.

				LAMA SU
			And now to business. You will be
			delighted to hear we are on
			schedule. Two hundred thousand
			units are ready, with another
			million well on the way.

				OBI-WAN
				(improvising)
			That is... good news.

				LAMA SU
			Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
			that we have every confidence his
			order will be met on time and in
			full. He is well, I hope?

				OBI-WAN
			I'm sorry Master - ?

				LAMA SU
			Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
			a leading member of the Jedi
			Council, is he not?

				OBI-WAN
			Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.

				LAMA SU
				(rising)
			You must be anxious to inspect the
			units for yourself.

				OBI-WAN
			That's why I'm here.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.

				PADMÉ
			I don't know...

				ANAKIN
			Sure you do... you just don't want
			to tell me.

				PADMÉ
			Are you going to use one of your
			Jedi mind tricks on me?

				ANAKIN
			They only work on the weak-minded.
			You are anything but weak-minded.

				PADMÉ
			All right... his name was Palo.
			I was twelve. We were both in the
			Legislative Youth Program. He was
			a few years older then I... very
			cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
			eyes.

				ANAKIN
			All right, I get the picture...
			whatever happened to him?

				PADMÉ
			I went on to become a Queen. He
			went on to become an artist.

				ANAKIN
			Maybe he was the smart one.

				PADME
			You really don't like politicians,
			do you?

				ANAKIN
			I like two or three, but I'm not
			really sure about one of them.
				(smiling)
			I don't think the system works.

				PADME
			How would you have it work?

				ANAKIN
			We need a system where the
			politicians sit down and discuss
			the problems, agree what's in the
			best interests of all the people,
			and then do it.

				PADME
			That is exactly what we do. The
			trouble is that people don't
			wlways agree. In fact, they
			hardly ever do.

				ANAKIN
			Then they should be made to.

				PADME
			By whom? Who's going to make them?

				ANAKIN
			I don't know. Someone.

				PADME
			You?

				ANAKIN
			Of course not me.

				PADME
			But someone.

				ANAKIN
			Someone wise.

				PADME
			That sounds an awful lot like a
			dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

				ANAKIN
			Well, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.

				PADMÉ
			You're making fun of me.

				ANAKIN
			 	(sarcastic)
			On no, I'd be much too frightened
			to tease a Senator.

				PADMÉ
			You're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

				ANAKIN
			You're always so serious. Always
			carrying the weight of the
			universe on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.

				LAMA SU
				(beaming)
			Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

				LAMA SU
			We modified their genetic
			structure to make them less
			independent than the original
			host. As a result they are
			totally obedient, taking any order
			without question.

				OBI-WAM
			Who was the original host?

				LAMA SU
			A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
			We felt a Jedi would be the
			perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
			picked Jango Fett himself.

				OBI-WAN
			Where is this bounty hunter now?

				LAMA SU
			Oh, we keep him here. After a few
			hundred thousand clones, the
			genetic pattern starts to fade, so
			we take a fresh supply. He lives
			here, but he's free to come and go
			as he pleases.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.

				LAMA SU
			Apart from his pay, which is
			considerable, Fett demanded only
			one thing - an unaltered clone for
			himself. Curious isn't it?

				OBI-WAN
			Unaltered?

				LAMA SU
			Pure genetic replication. No
			tampering with the structure to
			make it more docile... and no
			growth acceleration...

				OBI-WAN
			I would like to meet this Jango
			Fett.

				TAUN WE
			I would be most happy to arrange
			it, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			You mentioned growth
			acceleration...

				LAMA SU
			Oh yes, it's essential.
			Otherwise, a mature clone would
			take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
			can do it in half the time. Those
			items you saw on the parade ground
			were started ten years ago, when
			Sido-dyas first placed the order,
			and they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

				OBI-WAN
			And these?

				LAMA SU
			About five years ago.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

				LAMA SU
			They're immensely superior to
			droids, capable of independent
			thought and action.

				OBI-WAN
			Very impressive.

				LAMA SU
			I'd hoped you would be pleased. 

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

				OBI-WAN
				(carefully)
			Tell me, prime minister, when my
			Master Sido-dyas first contacted
			you, did he say the order was
			for... himself... or?

				LAMA SU
			Himself? Of course not. This
			army is for the Republic?

				OBI-WAN
				(astonished)
			The Repubic?

				LAMA SU
			We are also very much agasint this
			Count Dooku and his seccessionist
			movement. We are proud to be of
			help to the Republic.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

				TAUN WE
			I have arranged for you to meet
			Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
			well.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, Arfour...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
			five," to Courscant: care of "the
			old folks home."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			...I've never heard of a Jedi
			called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

				MACE WINDU
			No. Whoever placed that order was
			not a Jedi, I can assure you.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I have a strong feeling that this
			bounty hunter is the assassin
			we're looking for.

				YODA
			Who he is working for... discover
			that, you must.

				OBI-WAN (V.O.)
			I will, Master, and I will also
			find out more about this clone
			army... May The Force...

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

				WINDU 
			A clone army! Ordered by someone
			in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
			out to start a war.

				YODA
			Inform the chancellor of this, we
			must.

				WINDU
			Who do you think this impostor
			Sido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat 
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

				ANAKIN
			No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
			no, don't!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment, PAMDE comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and turns to go.

				ANAKIN
				(eyes closed)
			Don't go.

				PAMDE
			I don't want to disturb you.

				ANAKIN
			Your presence is soothing.

Brief pause.

				PADME
			You had a nightmare again last
			night.

				ANAKIN
			Jedi don't have nightmares.

				PADME
			I heard you.

ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.

				ANAKIN
			I saw my mother. I saw her as
			clearly as I see you now. She's
			suffering, Padme. She is in
			pain...They're killing her!
				(getting up)
			I know I'm disobeying my mandate
			to protect you, Senator. I know I
			will be punished and possibly
			thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
			I must go. I have to help her!
			I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
			choice.

				PADME
			Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
			you give up your future for me.
			I'll go with you. That way you
			can continue to protect me, and
			you won't be disobeying your
			mandate.

				ANAKIN
			What about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

				PADME
			I guess we won't tell him, will we?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.

				TAUN WE
			Boba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

				TAUN WE
				(continuing)
			May we see him?

				BOBA FETT
			Sure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

				TAUN WE
			Welcome back, Jango. Was your
			trip productive?

				JANGO FETT
			Fairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.

				TAUN WE
			This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
			Kenobi. He's come to check on our
			progress.

				JANGO FETT
			That right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

				OBI-WAN
			Your clones are very impressive.
			You must be very proud.

				JANGO FETT
			I'm just a simple man, trying to
			make my way in the universe,
			Master Jedi.

				OBI-WAN
			Aren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Ever made your way as far into the
			interior as Coruscant?

				JANGO
			Once or twice.

				OBI-WAN
			Recently?

				JANGO
				(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
			Possibly...

				OBI-WAN
			Then you must know Master Sido-
			Dyas?

				JANGO
			Boba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.

				JANGO
				(continuing)
			Master who?

				OBI-WAN
			Sido-Dyas. Isnt he the Jedi who
			hired you for this job?

				JANGO
			Never heard of him. I was
			recuited by a man called Darth
			Tyranus on one of the moons of
			Bogden.

				OBI-WAN
			No? I thought...

				TAUN WE
			Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
			And he showed up just when your
			Jedi Master said he would. We
			have kept the Jedis involvement
			a secret until your arrival, just
			as your Master requested.

				OBI-WAN
			Curious...

				JANGO
			Do you like your army?

				OBI-WAN
			It seems to me it's your army -
			being that they are all clones of
			you.

				JANGO
				(grinning)
			They'll do their job well, I'll
			guarantee that.

				OBI-WAN
			I look forward to seeing them in
			action. Thank you for your time,
			Jango.

				JANGO
			Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.

				BOBA
			What is it, Dad?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

				ANAKIN
				(to the droid driver)
			Wait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.

				WATTO
				(yelling, in Huttese)
			No, not that one - that one!

				ANAKIN
				(arriving)
			Excuse me, Watto.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			What?

				ANAKIN
				(in Huttese)
			I said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

				WATTO
				(in Huttese)
			Shut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

				WATTO
				(continuing, in Huttese)
			What? I don't know you... What can
			I do for you? You look like a
			Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
			do it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

				ANAKIN
			Let me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.

				WATTO
			Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.

				WATTO
				(continuing; in English)
			You are Annie! It is you! You
			little womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

				WATTO
				(continuing)
			You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
			Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
			you couldda help wit some
			daedbeats who owe...

				ANAKIN
			My mother...

				WATTO
			Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
			no more. I sold her.

				ANAKIN
			Sold her...

				WATTO
			Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
			know, business is business.
			Sold her to a moisture farmer
			named Lars. Least I think it was
			Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
			he freed her and married her. Can
			ya beat that?

				ANAKIN
			Do you know where they are?

				WATTO
			Long way from here... someplace
			over on the other side of Mos
			Eisley, I think...

				ANAKIN
			I'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

				WATTO
			Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
			go look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

				LAMA SU
			Tell your Council the first
			battalions are ready. And remind
			them that if they need more
			troops, we will need time to grow
			them.

				OBI-WAN
			I won't forget.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

				PADME
			Stay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive,

				C-3PO
			Good evening. May I help you?

				ANAKIN
			Threepio?

				C-3PO
			Oh, my... oh, my! Master
			Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
			believe it! And this must be Miss
			Padme.

				PADME
			Hello, Threepio.

				ANAKIN
			I've come to see my mother.

				C-3PO
			Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
			Master Annie.

				PADME
			Threepio, what's happened?

				C-3PO
			I think we'd better go inside.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead.

				C-3PO
			Master Lars - Master Owen!
			Somebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

				ANAKIN
			I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
			looking for my mother.

				OWEN
			Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
			step-brother.
				(they shake hands)
			This is my girlfriend, Beru.

				BERU
			Hello.

				PADME
			I'm Padme.

				OWEN
			I had a feeling you might show up
			some day.

				ANAKIN
			Is my mother here?

				CLIEGG
			No, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
			Come on inside. We have a lot to
			talk about.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen...

				CLIEGG (O.S.)
			It was just before dawn. They
			came out of nowhere. A hunting
			party of Tusekn Raiders.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.

				CLIEGG
			Your mother had gone out early,
			like she always did, to pick
			mushrooms that grow on the
			vaporatos. From the tracks, she
			was about halfway when they
			took her. Those Tuskens walk like
			men, but they're vicious, mindless
			monsters. Thirty of us went out
			after her. Four of us came back.
			Three more are still out there
			looking. I'd be with them,
			only... I just couldn't ride any
			more... until I heal.

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

				CLIEGG
				(continuing)
			This isn't the way I wanted to
			meet you, son. This isn't how
			your mother and I planned it. I
			don't want to give up on her, but
			she's been gone a month. There's
			little hope she's lasted this long.

Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.

				OWEN
			Where are you going?

				ANAKIN
			To find my mother.

				PADME
			No, Annie!

				CLIEGG
			She's daed, son. Accept it.

				ANAKIN
			I can feel her pain, and I will
			find her. I know she's alive.

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

				ANAKIN
			You are going to have to stay
			here. These are good people,
			Padme. You'll be safe.

				OWEN
			Take my speeder bike.

				PADME
			Anakin...

PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by.

				ANAKIN
			I trust you'll watch over her,
			Owen.

				OWEN
			Don't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

				ANAKIN
			I won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.

				JANGO FETT
			Nearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

				BOBA FETT
			Dad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.

				JANGO FETT
			Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.

				BOBA FETT
			Dad! Watch out!

				JANGO FETT
			Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
			That Jedi won't be able to follow
			us through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.

				BOBA FETT
			Got him! Yeahhhhh!

				JANGO FETT
			We won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:

				C-3PO
			Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
			These people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

				PADME
			I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
			can't sleep.

				C-3PO
			That's something I cannot relate
			to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
			either active or inactive.
			There's no in-between.

				PADME
			I guess you're lucky.

				C-3PO
			Do you really think so..? I
			suppose I shouldn't expect...

				PADME
			You're not happy here?

				C-3PO
			Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
			masters here ar so kind I
			wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
			it's just... being like this...
			well, it's embarrassing.

				PADME
			Being like what?

				C-3PO
			Naked. If you pardon the
			expression. You see, when Master
			Annie made me, he never quite
			found the time to give me any
			outer covering. It's so
			humiliating. How would you like it
			if you had to go around with all
			your circuits showing?

				PADME
			I guess I wouldn't like it at all.

				C-3PO
			Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
			would. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.

				PADME
			Maybe we can do something about it.

				C-3PO
			I don't think so. Only Master
			Annie...

				PADME
			Why not? They seem to have a box
			of old coverings here.

				C-3PO
			Oh? How observant of you, Miss
			Padme. Of course, I'm just not
			mechanically minded... if you see
			what I mean.

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

				PADME
			Let's see, if we put this...
			here...

				C-3PO
			Ooooh! That's tickles.

				PADME
			You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
			Hold still, please.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been 
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

				ANAKIN
			Mom... Mom... Mom... 

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

				SHMI
			Annie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

				ANAKIN
			Im here, Mom. Youre safe. Hang
			on. Im going to get you out of
			here...

				SHMI
			Im so glad... to see you,
			Annie... Now... I am complete...

				ANAKIN
			Just stay with me, Mom. Im going
			to make you well again.
			Everythings going to be fine.

				SHMI
			You look so handsome. My son...
			my grown-up son. Im so proud of
			you, Annie... so proud... I missed
			you so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakins lightsaber switches on.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

				OBI-WAN
			"Guiding light" to "old folks
			home."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

				OBI-WAN
			...Starships from the Trade
			Federation and the Commerce Guilds
			are taking deliveries of battle
			droids from the foundries on
			Geonosis.

				BAIL ORGANA
			That's outrageous! The treaty
			forbids the Trade Federation from
			building up an army. What are
			they doing?!

				OBI-WAN
			The droid foundry seems to be
			working at full capacity. I am
			going to go down and investigate.
			I will bring Jango Fett back home
			for interrogation.

				PALPATINE
			Those Geonosian foundries are part
			of the Techno Union. We will call
			in their representatives and ask
			them a few very pointed questions.

				OBI-WAN
			One more thing. Jango mentioned
			he was recruited by someone named
			Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
			might be?

				YODA
			With the forename Darth, a Sith he
			must be.

				MACE WINDU
			Our missing apprentice. They are
			playing their hand at last.

				OBI-WAN
			Do you believe he could be the
			mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
			deal for the clone army?

				YODA
			Perhaps too many pieces are missing
			from this puzzle, there are.

				MACE WINDU
			Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
			investigation is becoming less
			than routine. Do you need help?

				OBI-WAN
			Let me see if I can figure out
			what's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.

				BAIL ORGANA
			The Commerce Guilds are preparing
			for war... there can be no doubt
			of that.

				PALPATINE
			Count Dooku must have made a
			treaty with them.

				MACE WINDU
			We must stop them soon before
			they're fully ready.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			The debate is over, we need
			that clone army now!

				BAIL ORGANA
			Unfortunately, the debate is not
			over. The Senate will never be
			able to approve the use of that
			army before the separatists
			attack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

				MAS AMEDDA
			This is a crisis! If the Senate
			votes the Chancellor emergency
			powers, he could approve the use
			of the army in a minute.

				PALPATINE
			Please, please, I don't wish to
			have emergency powers. That's too
			extreme a solution. It's akin to
			a dictatorship. We must rely on
			the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
			are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

				YODA
			Two Hundred,... less or more.

				BAIL ORGANA
			With all due respect for the Jedi
			Order, two hundred will be no
			match for hundreds of thousands of
			battle droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Patience. We should wait for Obi-
			Wan to report back. We don't know
			that Count Dooku has made a treaty
			with the Corporate Alliance, it's
			speculation.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			But we must prepare for the worst.
			I'm going to propose a motion
			granting emergency powers to the
			Chancellor at the next session. We
			must not wait!

				PALPATINE
			Out of the question, Senator! You
			and I are too closely aligned.
			The issue will become partisan and
			debates will begin. The proposal
			must come from a neutral source.

				MAS AMEDDA
			If only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

				JAR JAR
			Supreme Chancellor... my august
			colleagues, I would be proud to
			propose the motion in question.
			This is a grave situation, and I'm
			sure Senator Amidala, and the
			Queen of Naboo would agree.

				SENATOR ASK AAK
			Thank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

				PALPATINE
			If called upon, I will serve. But
			it will be the saddest day of my
			life.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

				PADME
			There!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.

				C-3PO
			Um. How do I look?

				OWEN
			Great! You look perfect.

				C-3PO
			Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
			happy!
				(extending his hand to shake hers)
			Oh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

				THREEPIO
				(continuing)
			Thank you.

He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

				OWEN
				(grinning)
			Well, Padme, I think he should be
			yours from now on... I know that
			is what my Mom would want.

				C-3PO
			Oh, my!

Then suddenly, from outside:

				BERU (V.O.)
			Come topside, everybody! He's
			back! He's back!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.

				OBI-WAN
			...Alliance have pledged their
			armies to Count Dooku and are
			forming an... Wait!... ah...
			attack... I don't... make it...
			aaaggghhh!

The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.

				ANAKIN
			I'm going after him!

				PADME
			I thought the first thing he said
			was to retransmit his message to
			Coruscant.

				ANAKIN
			Yeah, you're right, you're right.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.

				MACE WINDU
			We will deal with Count Dooku. The
			most important thing for you,
			Anakin, is to stay where you are.
			Protect the Senator at all costs.
			That is your priority.

				ANAKIN
			Understood, Master.

The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel.

				PADME
			They'll never get there in time to
			save him. They have to come half
			way across the galaxy. Look,
			Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.

				ANAKIN
			If he's still alive.

				PADME
			Annie, are you just going to sit
			here and let him die?? He's your
			friend... your mentor...

				ANAKIN
			...He's like my father, but you
			heard Master Windu. He gave me
			strict orders to stay here.

				PADME
			He gave you strict orders to
			protect me...

PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.

				PADME
				(continuing)
			...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
			So if you plan to protect me, you
			will have to come along.

ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.

				MACE WINDU
			The longer we wait, the stronger
			Dooku's armies become. We cannot
			wait for the Senate to make up its
			mind about granting the Chancellor
			emergency powers, in order to be
			able to use that clone army... We
			have the authority to go now. We
			must go now.

All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.

				YODA
			Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
			Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
			they are.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell furiously at one another.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! Order!!

Finally, the uproar dies.

				PALPATINE
			In the regrettable absence of
			Senator Amidala, the chair
			recognises Senior
			Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
			Binks.

Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.

				JAR JAR
			Senators, dellow felagates...

Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.

				MAS AMEDDA
			Order! The Senate will accord the
			Representative the courtesy of a
			hearing!

Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.

				JAR JAR
			In response to the direct threat
			to the Republic from the
			Confederacy of Independent
			Systems, I propose that the Senate
			gives immediate emergency powers to
			the Supreme Chancellor.

Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.

				JAR JAR
				(continuing)
			Who can deny these are exceptional
			times? Exceptional times demand
			exceptional measures!
			Exceptional measures demand
			exceptional men!

				ORN FREE TAA
			We won't support a dictator.

SHOUTS of agreement.

				JAR JAR
			That is the sentiment every one of
			us agrees with! And when the
			shadow of war has dispersed and
			the bright day of liberty has
			dawned once again, the power we now
			give to the Supreme Chancellor
			will be gladly, and swiftly
			returned. Out ancient liberties
			will be restored to us, burnished
			even more brightly than before!

Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows.

PALPATINE rises.

				PALPATINE
			It is with great reluctance that
			I have agreed to this calling. I
			love democracy... I love the
			Republic. The fact that this
			crisis is demanding I be given
			absolute power to tule over you is
			evident. But I am mild by nature
			and have no desire to destroy
			the democratic process. The power you
			give me I will lay down when this
			crisis has abated, I promise you.
			And all I ask in return is when my
			current term of office is over,
			you allow me to reture and live
			out my life in peace.

				MAS AMEDDA
			We shall proceed to the vote. All
			those in favor of granting
			emergency powers to the Supreme
			Chancellor, signal ate at this
			time... those opposed?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
The Naboo Starship lands.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She gets up.

				ANAKIN
			Hey, where are you going?

				PADME
			To find Obi-Wan.

ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.

				ANAKIN
			No! You're not!

He grabs her arm.

				PADME
			Let go of me!

				ANAKIN
			I'm not letting you go out there.
			It's too dangerous.

				PADMÉ
			What?!?

				ANAKIN
			It's my job to protect you. I said
			it's too dangerous. You're not
			going, and that's final!

				PADMÉ
			Don't you give me orders, Annie!
			I'm a Senator of the Galactic
			Republic. You have no authority
			to contain me, restrain me, or
			direct me! You remember your
			place, young man.
				(standing up)
			Now you can come along and protect
			me or stay here. It's up to you.

PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows.

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
			Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
			confusing. One moment they're
			generating a pleasant mutual
			attraction and the next, waves of
			violent hostility. Even though
			I'm programmed to understand them,
			I doubt if I ever shall.

ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness.

				PADME
				(in a low voice)
			It's empty!

They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.

				PADME
			Wait!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them.

The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Senator Amidala, I've heard so
			much about you.

				PADMÉ
			Count Dooku, I assume.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I'm delighted to meet you at
			last. We have a great deal to
			discuss, Senator. I hope you can
			keep your young Jedi under control.

				PADMÉ
			Don't worry he's housebroken.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far 
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.

				PADMÉ
			You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
			Wan Kenobi. I am formally
			requesting you turn him over to
			me, now.

				DOOKU
			He has been convicted of
			espionage, Senator, and will be
			executed. In just a few hours, I
			believe.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				PADMÉ
			He is an officer of the Republic.
			You can't do that.

				DOOKU
			We don't recognise the Republic
			here, Senator. But if Naboo were
			to join our Alliance, I could
			easily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

				PADMÉ
			And if I don't join your
			rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
			me will also die?

				DOOKU
			I don't wish to make you to join
			our cause against your will,
			Senator, but you are a rational,
			honest representative of your
			people and I assume you want to do
			what's in their best interest.
			Aren't you fed up with the
			corruption, the bureaucrats, the
			hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
			you? Be honest, Senator.

				PADMÉ
			The ideals are still alive, Count,
			even if the institution is failing.

				DOOKU
			You believe in the same ideals we
			believe in! The same ideals we
			are striving to make prominent.

				PADMÉ
			If what you say is true, you
			should stay in the Republic and
			help Chancellor Palpatine put
			things right.

				DOOKU
			The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
			but he is incompetent. He has
			promised to cut the bureaucracy,
			but the bureaucrats are stronger
			than ever, no? Senator, the
			Republic cannot be fixed. It is
			time to start over. The
			democratic process in the Republic
			is a sham, a shell game played
			on the voters. It will not be long
			before the cult of greed, called
			the Republic, will lose even the
			pretext of democracy and freedom.

				PADMÉ
			I cannot believe that. I will not
			forsake all I have honoured and
			worked for and betray the
			Republic. I know of your treaties
			with the Trade Federation, the
			Commerce Guilds, and the others,
			Count. What is happening here is
			not government that has been
			bought out by business... it's
			business becoming government!

				DOOKU
			Are you willing to betray your Jedi
			friends? Without your co-operation
			I can do nothing to stop their
			execution.

				PADMÉ
			What is to happen to me? Am I to be
			executed also?

				DOOKU
			I wouldn't think of such an
			offence. But, there are
			individuals who have a strong
			interest in your demise, M'lady.
			It has nothing to do with
			politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
			personal, and they have already
			paid great sums to have you
			assassinated. I'm sure they will
			push hard to have you included in
			the executions. I'm sorry but if
			you are not going to co-operate, I
			must turn you over to the
			Geonosians for justice. I've done
			all I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

				JANGO FETT
			I'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

				DOOKU 
			You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
			my young Jedi, but you will not
			escape.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.

				SUN RIT
			You have been charged and found
			guilty of Espionage.

				POGGLE
			Do you have anything to say before
			your sentence is carried out?

				PADMÉ
			You are committing an act of war,
			Archduke. I hope you are prepared
			for the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

				POGGLE
			We build weapons, Senator... that
			is our business! Of course we're
			prepared!

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Get on with it. Carry out the
			sentence. I want to see her suffer.

				POGGLE
			Your other Jedi friend is waiting
			for you, Senator. Take them to
			the arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

				ANAKIN
			Don't be afraid.

				PADMÉ
			I'm not afraid to die. I've been
			dying a little bit each day since
			you came back into my life.

				ANAKIN
			What are you talking about?

				PADMÉ
			I love you.

				ANAKIN
			You love me?! I thought we
			decided not to fall in love. That
			we would be forced to live a lie.
			That it would destroy our lives...

				PADMÉ
			I think our lives are about to be
			destroyed anyway. My love for you
			is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
			have no answers. I can't control
			it... and now I don't care. I
			truly, deeply love you, and before
			we die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for 
their lips to meet. They kiss.

				ANAKIN
			I have no desire to be cured of
			this love either. Long or short,
			I vow to spend the rest of my life
			with you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

				OBI-WAN
			I was beginning to wonder if you
			had gotten my message.

				ANAKIN
			I retransmitted it as you
			requested, Master. Then we decided
			to come and rescue you.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like you're going a good
			job so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.

				SUN RIT
			The felons before you have been
			convicted of espionage against the
			Sovereign System of Geonosis.
			Their sentence of death is to be
			carried out in this public arena
			henceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.

				POGGLE
			Let the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

				ANAKIN
			I have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.

				OBI-WAN
			Take the one the left. I'll
			take the one on the right.

				ANAKIN
			What about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.

				OBI-WAN
			It looks like she's already on top
			of things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

				NUTE GUNRAY
			Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
			her or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

				ANAKIN
			You okay?

				PADME
				(nods, gasping)
			Sure! Well, sort of.

				ANAKIN
			Jump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

				NUTE GUNRAY
			This isn't how it's supposed to
			be! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(smiling enigmatically)
			Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
			Maybe this is the way it's
			supposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
ARTOO BEEPS

				C-3PO
			Yes, it has been rather a long
			time. Do you suppose something's
			happened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

				C-3PO
				(continuing)
			Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
			so. It looks a very dull planet
			to me. They should be back
			shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu, how pleasant of you
			to join us. You're just in time
			for the moment of truth. I would
			think these two new boys of yours
			could use a little more training.

				MACE WINDU
			Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
			This party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(to Mace Windu)
			Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
			friend. You're impossibly
			outnumbered.

				MACE WINDU
			I don't think so. One Jedi has to
			be worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			It wasn't the Geonosians I was
			thinking about. How well do you
			think one Jedi will hold up
			against a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO whistles.

				C-3PO
			I don't hear anything.
				(Artoo beeps)
			You're scaring me! Stop imagining
			things!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

				OBI-WAN
			Someone's got to - shut down -
			these droids.

				MACE WINDU
			Don't worry! It's being - taken
			care of!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

				PLO KOON
			We've done it! Now we have a
			chance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

				KI-ADI-MUNDI
			The system's off but they're still
			active. That's a new feature. They
			are independent of the control
			system.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Windu!

Silence.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			You have fought gallantly. Worthy
			of recognition in the history
			archives of the Jedi Order. Now
			it is finished.
				(pauses briefly)
			Surrender - and your lives will be 
			spared.

				MACE WINDU
			We will not be hostages for you to
			barter with Dooku.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
			will have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

				PADME
			Look!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

				YODA
			Come on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

				YODA
			More battalions to the left.
			Encircle them we must, then
			divide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.

				C-3PO
			I'm sure I heard something, this
			time. Didn't you? It's probably
			just a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
Gunship #2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.

				OBI-WAN
			Hold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			It's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing)
			Padme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

				ANAKIN
				(continuing; to pilot)
			Put the ship down! Down!

				OBI-WAN
			No! Forget her. We have to go
			after Dooku.

				ANAKIN
			No we're not!! Land this ship!

				OBI-WAN
			Don't let your personal feelings
			get in the way. We've got a job to
			do.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.

				ANAKIN
			I don't care!.. Go back.

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			Follow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship #2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.

				DROID CAPTAIN
			Your Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

				COUNT DOOKU
			That won't be necessary, Captain.
			Stand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

				OBI-WAN
				(to Anakin)
			We move in together - you slowly
			on the...

				ANAKIN
			I'm taking him now!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin, no!

				ANAKIN
			You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
			killed today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN

				COUNT DOOKU
			Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
			my Jedi powers are far beyond
			yours. Now, back down.

				OBI-WAN
			I don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Ah, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			I have spent the last ten years
			learning to use the power of the
			Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
			greater power.

				OBI-WAN
			You will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Grand Master Kenobi, you
			disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
			such high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			Surely you can do better...?
				(parries)
			No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
			swordsmanship degenerated so
			quickly, or are you trying to make
			fun of me?
				(cuts)
			Which is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
			out of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

				COUNT DOOKU
				(continuing)
			That's brave of you, boy - but
			foolish. I would have thought
			you'd have learnt your lesson.

				ANAKIN
			I'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

				COUNT DOOKU
			You have unusual powers, young
			Padawan. But not enought to save
			you this time.

				ANAKIN
			Don't bet on it!

				OBI-WAN
			Anakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

				COUNT DOOKU
			Master Yoda. At last we shall
			know who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.

				YODA
			Count Dooku. No interest in
			contests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			The end for you, Count, this is.

				COUNT DOOKU
			...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADMÉ and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

				PADMÉ
			Anakin!

PADMÉ runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.

				CLONE CAPTAIN
			Resistance is at an end, General.
			What are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

				COUNT DOOKU
			The Force is with us, my Master.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
			done well.

				COUNT DOOKU
			I bring you good news, my Lord.
			The war has begun.

				DARTH SIDIOUS
			Excellent. 
			 	(smiling)
			Everything is going as planned.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

				MACE WINDU
			Where is your apprentice?

				OBI-WAN
			On his way back to Naboo. He is
			escorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

				OBI-WAN
				(continuing)
			I must admit without the clones,
			it would not have been a victory.

				YODA
			Victory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.

				YODA
				(continuing)
			Not victory, a defeat, it was...
			Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
			War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

by a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.

Episode VI
RETURN OF THE JEDI

Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an 
attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of theÊvile 
gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE 
has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even 
more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this 
ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels 
struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...

PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive 
superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of 
a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, 
green moon of ENDOR.

An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored 
space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial 
shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the 
Death Star.

2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT 
The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting 
our approach. Deactivate the security shield.

DEATH STAR CONTROLLER	(filtered VO)
The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have 
confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to 
proceed.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
We're starting our approach.

3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits 
switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death 
Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible 
deflector shield.

A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.

OFFICER
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

OPERATOR
Yes, sir.

The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial 
shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial 
stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.

4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, 
strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. 
The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. 
But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.

The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only 
darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this 
black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the 
assemblage as he walks down the ramp.

JERJERROD
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your 
presence.

VADER
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you 
back on
schedule.

The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

JERJERROD
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

VADER
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

JERJERROD
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

VADER
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

JERJERROD
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

VADER
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

JERJERROD	 (aghast)
The Emperor's coming here?

VADER
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your 
apparent lack of progress.

JERJERROD
We shall double our efforts.

VADER
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as 
I am.

5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE

A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine 
terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before 
catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along 
the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.

THREEPIO
Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and 
poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.

Artoo whistles timidly.

THREEPIO
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this 
Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.

The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.

THREEPIO
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.

6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE 

Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly 
knocks on the iron door.

THREEPIO	 (instantly) 
There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master 
Luke.

A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical 
arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects 
the two droids.

STRANGE VOICE
Tee chuta hhat yudd!

THREEPIO
Goodness gracious me!

 Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.

 THREEPIO
 Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.

The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the 
eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his 
concern.

THREEPIO
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.

Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the 
massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The 
robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at 
one another, afraid to enter.

Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby 
companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.

THREEPIO 
Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should 
rush into all this.

Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!

7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY

The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark 
passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN 
GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the 
two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order. 
Artoo beeps nervously.

THREEPIO
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! 
Oh! Oh, no.

Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike 
alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.

BIB
Die Wanna Wanga!

THREEPIO
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, 
Jabba the Hutt.

Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.

THREEPIO	 (cont)
...and a gift.
(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
Gift, what gift?

Bib shakes his head negatively.

BIB
Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, 
letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the 
strange-looking alien.

THREEPIO
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.

Bib thinks about this for a moment.

THREEPIO
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort 
of things.

Bib gestures for the droids to follow.

BIB
Nudd Chaa.

The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed 
by the two guards.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.

8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES 
ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as 
they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts 
partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the 
room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating 
crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a 
repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the 
horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At 
the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS 
CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba 
laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows 
politely.

THREEPIO
Good morning.

JABBA
Bo Shuda!

The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned 
villain.

THREEPIO
The message, Artoo, the message.

Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, 
creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten 
feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.

LUKE
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke 
Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are 
powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally 
powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's 
life. 
(Jabba's crowd laughs) 
With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which 
will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant 
confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: 
these two droids.

Threepio is startled by this announcement.

THREEPIO
What did he say?

LUKE	 (cont)
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.

THREEPIO
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.

Luke's hologram disappears.

Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain.

THREEPIO
We're doomed.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he 
is.

Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. 
Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a 
carbonized HAN SOLO.

THREEPIO
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.

9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR 

One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, 
shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable 
creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm 
or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps 
pitifully.

THREEPIO
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? 
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!

A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break 
free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.

10   INT BOILER ROOM

The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy 
machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are 
met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can 
be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work 
droid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons 
are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized 
electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-
9D9.

NINEDENINE
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

THREEPIO
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

NINEDENINE
Yes or no will do.

THREEPIO
Oh. Well, yes.

NINEDENINE
How many languages do you speak?

THREEPIO
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can 
readily...

NINEDENINE
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got 
angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.

THREEPIO
Disintegrated?

NINEDENINE	 (to a Gamorrean guard)
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining 
bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.

The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.

THREEPIO	 (disappearing)
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!

Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps 
angrily.

NINEDENINE
You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have 
need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in 
nicely.

The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured 
electronic scream.

11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous 
party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a 
fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.

Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons 
Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, 
shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.

JABBA
Da Eitha!

The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.

OOLA
Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...

Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.

JABBA
Boscka!

He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the 
floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a 
muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous 
friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her 
fate through a grate.

Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han 
Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.ÊAn 
unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the 
room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two 
guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his 
captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.

Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into 
his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens 
intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a 
greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).

BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! Chewbacca!

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to 
Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.

THREEPIO
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!

Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh 
listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices 
BOBA FETT standing near the door.

THREEPIO
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the 
reward of twenty-five thousand.

BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I want fifty thousand. No less.

Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the 
raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his 
weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the 
throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.

THREEPIO
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
(to Boushh)
Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.

The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio 
looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The 
droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.

THREEPIO
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the 
room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the 
bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba 
stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across 
his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.

Jabba continues.

THREEPIO
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.

Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his 
reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes 
dead.

BOUSHH
Zeebuss.

THREEPIO
He agrees!

The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and 
applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca 
growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a 
skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing 
girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly 
appreciative creatures.

Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the 
scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across 
the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling 
his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.

12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL

Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When 
a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes 
against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. 
It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming 
the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the 
iron door.

13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE

The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in 
front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert 
rodent and burps in satisfaction.

14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien 
celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several 
drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.

A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of 
the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his 
way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.

Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his 
coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter 
deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of 
the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.

Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the 
controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches 
and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization 
lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the 
contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches 
as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, 
previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His 
face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.

Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath 
of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he 
begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.

BOUSHH
Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.

Han touches his face with his hand and moans.

BOUSHH
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

HAN
I can't see.

BOUSHH
Your eyesight will return in time.

HAN
Where am I?

BOUSHH
Jabba's palace.

HAN
Who are you?

The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, 
revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.

LEIA
Someone who loves you.

HAN
Leia!

LEIA
I gotta get you out of here.

As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is 
pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.

HAN
What's that? I know that laugh.

The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the 
Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his 
gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.

HAN
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I 
got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.

Jabba laughs.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but 
now you're Bantha fodder.

HAN
Look...

JABBA	 (cont Huttese subtitled)
Take him away!

The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.

HAN
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. 
Don't be a fool!

Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead 
Leia away.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring her to me.

Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young 
princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly 
turns away in disgust.

LEIA
We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I'm sure.

Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly 
blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.

LEIA
Ugh!

THREEPIO
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

15   INT DUNGEON CELL

The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A 
guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door 
slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack 
in the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is 
heard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell 
door and listens.

HAN
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?

The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting 
him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, 
revealing Chewie.

HAN
Ah! Chew--Chewie!

The giant Wookiee barks with glee.

HAN
Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?

Chewie barks an excited blue streak.

HAN
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less 
rescue anybody.

Chewie barks a reply.

HAN
A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets 
delusions of grandeur.

Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.

HAN
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.

16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE

Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT 
and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a 
robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke 
strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block 
Luke's path. Luke halts.

Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately 
lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and 
moves on down the hallway.

Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they 
approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his 
direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the 
conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.

LUKE
I must speak with Jabba.

Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and 
stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.

LUKE
You will take me to Jabba now!

Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him 
into the gloom.

LUKE
You serve your master well.

Bib responds.

LUKE
And you will be rewarded.

17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. 
Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now 
dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a 
manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. 
Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.

THREEPIO
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

BIB
Master.

Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.

BIB
...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I told you not to admit him.

LUKE
I must be allowed to speak.

BIB	 (in Huttese subtitled)
He must be allowed to speak.

Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

Luke stares hard at Jabba.

LUKE
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

LUKE
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either 
profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not 
to underestimate my powers.

Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about 
the pit.

THREEPIO
Master Luke, you're standing on...

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.

Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies 
into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his 
hand.

JABBA
Bascka!

The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into 
the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba 
laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained 
by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at 
him and he shakes his head "no."

18   INT RANCOR PIT

Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the 
dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically 
for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in 
the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. 
Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! The Rancor!

At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged 
RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries 
futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.

The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the 
Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few 
screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers 
and laughs at the guard's fate.

The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just 
ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of 
an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his 
salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the 
monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in 
rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an 
avalanche.

The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes 
into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the 
holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility 
door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into 
the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it 
down on the Rancor's finger.

19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT

The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding 
cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he 
succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond 
the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the 
monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The 
guards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears, 
laughing.

Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for 
him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. 
As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the 
cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes 
crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on 
an egg.

A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation 
at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning 
red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh 
commands to his guards and they hurry off.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.

21   INT RANCOR PIT

The Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead 
beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly 
at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel 
and take Luke away.

22   INT THRONE ROOM

The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into 
the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.

LUKE
Han!

HAN
Luke!

LUKE
Are you all right?

HAN
Fine. Together again, huh?

LUKE
Wouldn't miss it.

HAN
How are we doing?

LUKE
The same as always.

HAN
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

Luke looks to Leia.

LEIA
I'm here.

Threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia 
like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from 
the other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.

Threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed 
that you are to be terminated immediately.

HAN
Good, I hate long waits.

THREEPIO
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of 
Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

HAN	 (to Luke)
Doesn't sound so bad.

THREEPIO
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as 
you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

HAN
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

Chewie barks his agreement.

LUKE
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever 
make.

Jabba cackles evilly at this.

As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer 
rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but 
Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.

23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF

Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by 
two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, 
Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is 
Lando in disguise.

HAN
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a 
big light blur.

LUKE
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.

HAN
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

LUKE
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

HAN
Oh... great!

24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His 
entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. 
Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to 
her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to 
him.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller 
droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby 
droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.

THREEPIO
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?

Artoo beeps a quick reply.

THREEPIO
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. 
They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!

Artoo whistles a singsong response.

THREEPIO
Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.

25   EXT SARLACC PIT 

The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one 
side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's 
skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of 
the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by 
thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is 
extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's 
bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.

26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward 
and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps 
up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of 
intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across 
loudspeakers.

THREEPIO
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die 
honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba 
the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.

27   EXT SKIFF

Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.

HAN
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get 
no such pleasure from us. Right?

Chewie growls his agreement.

LUKE
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.

Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look 
of conspiracy to him.

28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips 
unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as 
he speaks into the comlink.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Move him into position.

Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.

29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK

Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. 
Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the 
plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a 
jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap 
opens in Artoo's domed head.

JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Put him in.

30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK

Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the 
bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is 
happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his 
fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him 
skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of 
the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He 
casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has 
sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.

With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded 
him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The 
other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber 
flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.

31   EXT SARLACC PIT

A bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and 
begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him 
and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.

32   INT SAIL BARGE

Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the 
guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures 
watching the action from the window are in an uproar.

33   EXT SKIFF 

Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of 
the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.

LUKE
Easy, Chewie.

At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts 
from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of 
the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately 
above the Sarlacc pit.

LANDO
Whoa! Whoa! Help!

34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket 
pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.

35   EXT SKIFF

Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who 
has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, 
the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty 
hunter's gun in half.

Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck 
gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the 
rail.

HAN
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?

The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.

HAN
I'm okay, pal.

For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a 
cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong 
cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from 
the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight 
up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable 
and stands free.

Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is 
knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.

LANDO
Han! Chewie?

HAN
Lando!

Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets 
him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves 
in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young 
Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating 
the guards from their midst.

Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han, 
guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. 
Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold 
of the spear.

Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the 
other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his 
arm, and aims his lethal appendage.

Chewie barks desperately at Han.

HAN
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?

The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand 
whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.

The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts 
off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the 
side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams 
as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into 
the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a 
weak congratulations to Han.

36   INT SAIL BARGE

Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and 
throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous 
neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the 
chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath 
the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his 
scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms 
through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia 
struggles to free herself of her bondage.

37   EXT SKIFF

Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han 
extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously 
from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.

HAN
Lando, grab it!

LANDO
Lower it!

HAN
I'm trying!

A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han 
and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, 
and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot 
catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. 
The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit 
from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.

HAN
Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.

Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han 
extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the 
pit.

HAN
Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!

Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck 
gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the 
skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail 
Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up 
the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his 
head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks 
the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.

The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who 
is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron 
has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by 
lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand 
moves him closer to his final reward.

HAN
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!

Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let 
go of the spear.

LANDO
Hold it! Whoa!

Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.

HAN
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.

Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly 
around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.

HAN
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

LANDO
No, wait! I thought you were blind!

HAN
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

LANDO
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate 
fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and 
Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.

HAN
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

38   EXT UPPER DECK

The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in 
their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: 
Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. 
The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young 
Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more 
gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) 
racing for him, firing their laser pistols.

39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK

Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips 
through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby 
little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.

LEIA
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.

Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and 
screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out 
one of the golden droid's eyes.

THREEPIO
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!

Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, 
crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye 
dangling from a wire) hurry off.

40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by 
guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke 
turns to face another guard.

LUKE	 (to Leia)
Get the gun! Point it at the deck!

Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels 
the gun around.

LUKE
Point it at the deck!

A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, 
but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the 
guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He 
flexes the hand; it still works.

Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves 
as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.

THREEPIO
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.

Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, 
tumbling toward the sand.

Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she 
has brought around to point down at the deck.

LUKE
Come on!

Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers 
Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun 
explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.

41   EXT SKIFF  

Han leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck. 
Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.

LUKE
Let's go! And don't forget the droids.

LANDO
We're on our way.

The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge 
craft is on fire.

42   EXT SAND DUNE

Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next 
to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff 
floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. 
With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled 
from the sand.

43   EXT DUNE SEA

The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues 
its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the 
barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.

44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA

A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR 
THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, 
pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed 
by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each 
supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his 
wound.

Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It 
is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing 
and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.

HAN
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!

LEIA
That's all any of us can see.

HAN	 (blinking)
Then I guess I'm getting better.

As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind 
dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. 
Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.

HAN 	(turning to Luke)
I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.

LUKE	 (shrugging it off)
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.

HAN
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest 
thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide 
awake nothing!

Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, 
mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.

LUKE 	(moving to his ship)
I'll see you back at the fleet.

HAN
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

LUKE
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.

HAN		
(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's 
betrayal and subsequent aide)
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

LANDO
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the 
rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

LEIA
He means "You're welcome."

LANDO
Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE 

The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and 
peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and 
grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.

45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the 
canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM 
FALCON.

LUKE
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

LEIA	 (over comlink)
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.

LUKE
I will.

HAN	 (over comlink)
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.

A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of 
Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black 
glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.

LUKE
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a 
promise to keep... to an old friend.

46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR

A Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in 
space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, 
Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward 
the Death Star.

47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY

Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous 
Death Star commander.

48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR

Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth 
docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where 
the shuttle is coming to rest.

The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and 
create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention 
with a momentous SNAP.

Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a 
rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way 
down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak 
similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's 
face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow 
eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme 
Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.

EMPEROR	 (to Vader)
Rise, my friend.

Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way 
along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay 
kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several 
Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the 
procession.

VADER
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

EMPEROR
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue 
your search for young Skywalker.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, 
you must bring him
before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the 
dark side of the
Force.

VADER
As you wish.

EMPEROR
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial 
troops.

49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH

Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of 
the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps 
disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm 
yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.

50   INT YODA'S HOUSE

The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of 
the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that 
clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. 
His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.

YODA
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?

Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look 
has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.

LUKE
No... of course not.

YODA	 (tickled, chuckles)
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. 
(Points a crooked finger)
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?

Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.

YODA
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.

Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.

LUKE
Master Yoda, you can't die.

YODA
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me 
and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the 
Force.

LUKE
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.

YODA
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.

LUKE
Then I am a Jedi?

YODA	 (shakes his head)
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, 
only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.

Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his 
courage. Finally he is able to ask.

LUKE
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?

Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile 
creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.

YODA
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.

Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.

LUKE
Yoda, I must know.

YODA
Your father he is.

Luke reacts as if cut.

YODA
Told you, did he?

LUKE
Yes.

A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.

YODA
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

LUKE
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.

YODA		 (gathering all his strength)
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your 
training. Not
ready for the burden were you.

LUKE
Well, I'm sorry.

YODA
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, 
fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever 
will it dominate your
destiny.

He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.

YODA
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, 
or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
(cough),
the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your 
family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... 
(with great effort)
There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green 
creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears 
in front of his eyes.

51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING 

Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, 
but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to 
help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.

LUKE
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

BEN	 (OS)
Yoda will always be with you.

Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.

LUKE
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?

The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.

LUKE
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

BEN
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be 
Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your 
father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a 
certain point of view.

LUKE	 (turning away, derisive)
A certain point of view!

BEN
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend 
greatly on our own
point of view.

Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.

BEN
I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it 
certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened 
to your father was my fault.

Ben pauses sadly.

BEN
Anakin was a good friend.

Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a 
stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.

BEN
When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was 
amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to 
train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well 
as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the 
galaxy.

Luke is entranced.

LUKE
There's still good in him.

BEN
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be 
done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

LUKE
I can't do it, Ben.

BEN
You cannot escape your destiny.

LUKE
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

BEN
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience 
was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value 
of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you 
could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been 
prepared.

LUKE
But I had to help my friends.

BEN	 (grinning at Luke's indignation)
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved 
little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.

LUKE	 (with sadness)
I found out Darth Vader was my father.

BEN
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side 
- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest 
door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what 
he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're 
no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, 
you must face Darth Vader again!

LUKE
I can't kill my own father.

BEN
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

LUKE
Yoda spoke of another.

BEN
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

LUKE
But I have no sister.

BEN
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your 
father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were 
to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the 
reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

LUKE
Leia! Leia's my sister.

BEN
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They 
do you credit.
But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.

BEN	 (continuing his narrative)
When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your 
mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep 
you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you 
to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia 
to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.

Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.

BEN	 (attempting to give solace with his words)
The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in 
that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew 
she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, 
since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family 
continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster 
father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of 
course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the 
corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a 
vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she 
was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had 
always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became 
desperate.

Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his 
sister.

LUKE
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

BEN
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, 
Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your 
family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy 
Vader!

52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a 
dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and 
battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the 
HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.

53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM

Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in 
the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a 
holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the 
nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.

MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern 
but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several 
military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a 
salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he 
finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.

Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.

HAN
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

 LANDO
 Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the 
battle of Taanab.

HAN	 (sarcastic)
Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I 
didn't know they were
lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.

LANDO	 (smiling)
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

HAN
Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable 
one, remember?

Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.

MON MOTHMA
The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has 
come.

This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the 
Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the 
center of the room.

MON MOTHMA
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location 
of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon 
systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial 
Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is 
relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that 
the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the 
construction of this Death Star.

A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia 
as Chewie barks his amazement.

MON MOTHMA	 (cont)
Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field 
and the Moon of Endor.

ACKBAR
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. 
Although the weapon
systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does 
have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, 
which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield 
must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield 
is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly 
into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

There's a concerned murmur.

ACKBAR	 (cont)
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Han turns to Lando with a look of respect.

HAN
Good luck.

Lando nods his thanks.

HAN
You're gonna need it.

ACKBAR
General Madine.

Madine moves center stage.

GENERAL MADINE
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and 
using a secret
Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the 
shield generator.

The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.

THREEPIO
Sounds dangerous.

LEIA	 (to Han)
I wonder who they found to pull that off.

GENERAL MADINE
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?

Leia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.

HAN
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.

Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.

HAN
Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.

Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.

HAN	 (smiles)
That's one.

LEIA
Uh, General... count me in.

VOICE	 (OS)
I'm with you, too!

They turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more 
cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and 
Leia are surprised and delighted.

Leia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him 
and looks into his eyes questioningly.

LEIA
 What is it?

LUKE	 (hesitant)
Ask me again sometime.

Han, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.

HAN
Luke.

LUKE
Hi, Han... Chewie.

Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.

 THREEPIO
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.

54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which 
looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay. 
Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up 
the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and 
supplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-
byes and start up the ramp.

HAN
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the 
help you can get. She's
the fastest ship in the fleet.

LANDO
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take 
good care of her.
She-she won't get a scratch. All right?

HAN	 (looks at him warmly)
Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.

LANDO
Look, would you get going, you pirate.

Han and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.

LANDO
Good luck.

HAN
You, too.

Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.

55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Luke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the 
pilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out 
all the Imperial controls.

HAN
You got her warmed?

LUKE
Yeah, she's comin' up.

Chewie growls a complaint.

HAN
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed 
her, Chewie.

Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.

Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on 
something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him 
gently.

LEIA
Hey, are you awake?

HAN
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the 
Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.

LEIA	 (softly)
Come on, General, let's move.

Han snaps back to life.

HAN
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, 
everybody?

LUKE
All set.

THREEPIO
Here we go again.

HAN
All right, hang on.

56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET

The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the 
Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms 
off into space.

57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at 
the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair 
before a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death 
Star to the giant green moon of Endor.

Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council, 
cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After 
several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.

VADER
What is thy bidding, my Master?

EMPEROR
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until 
called for.

VADER
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

EMPEROR
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young 
Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go 
out to the command ship and await my orders.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks 
toward the waiting council members.

58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON

There is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction 
proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star 
Destroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces 
itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.

59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Han looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches. 
Through the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star 
Destroyer can be seen.

HAN
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty 
quick, Chewie.

Chewie growls his agreement.

CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
We have you on our screen now. Please identify.

HAN
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.

CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.

HAN
Transmission commencing.

Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed 
transmission begins.

LEIA
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

HAN
It'll work. It'll work.

Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer 
that looms ever larger before them.

LUKE
Vader's on that ship.

HAN
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep 
your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep 
your distance.

Chewie barks a question.

HAN
I don't know.  Fly casual.

LUKE
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.

HAN
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out 
the window.

60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Lord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star. 
Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment 
of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL 
PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen 
earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.

VADER
Where is that shuttle going?

PIETT	 (into comlink)
Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?

PILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.

The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.

VADER
Do they have a code clearance?

PIETT
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.

Vader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.

PIETT
Shall I hold them?

VADER
No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.

PIETT	 (surprised)
As you wish, my lord.
(to controller)
Carry on.

Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.

61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

The group waits tensely.

HAN
They're not goin' for it, Chewie.

CONTROLLER	 (filtered)
Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. 
Follow your
present course.

Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks 
worried. Chewie barks.

HAN
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.

63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, 
primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.

On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a 
steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The 
troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio 
bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.

Up ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly 
to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke 
crawl up to take a look.

THREEPIO
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.

THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering 
through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked 
nearby.

LEIA
Shall we try and go around?

HAN
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie 
start quietly down.

64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE

The four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far 
from the two Imperial scouts.

HAN
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.

LUKE
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.

HAN	 (grins)
Hey... it's me.

Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. 
Luke and Leia exchange smiles.

Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout 
whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.

SCOUT #1
Go for help! Go!

The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie 
gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to 
crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.

LUKE	 (sarcastic)
Great. Come on.

Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol 
drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where 
two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied 
bike parked nearby.

LEIA
Over there! Two more of them!

LUKE
I see them. Wait, Leia!

But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She 
starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.

LUKE	 (pointing to the controls)
Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!

Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely 
avoiding two huge trees.

HAN
Hey, wait! Ahhh!

He flips the remaining scout to the ground.

65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE

The two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia 
pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from 
their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.

LUKE
Move closer!

Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer 
through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, 
slowing the scout.

LUKE
Get alongside that one!

Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their 
steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of 
the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him 
off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike 
and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the 
remaining scout.

LUKE
Get him!

The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing 
into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser 
cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a 
glancing hit.

LUKE	 (indicating the one ahead)
Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into 
the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as 
they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and 
starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a 
manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted 
out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.

The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into 
turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.

FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom 
through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and 
rises out of sight.

The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia 
dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes 
a glancing hit.

Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches 
down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has 
blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike 
explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. 
But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a 
giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a 
conflagration.

ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue 
their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The 
scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a 
bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top 
and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a 
wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside 
him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all 
his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able 
to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the 
scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are 
moving as one.

Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and 
dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's 
explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find 
Luke.

Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and 
opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and 
begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it 
appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, 
Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty 
slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, 
it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.

66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST

Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait 
anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed 
head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.

THREEPIO
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!

Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.

Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's 
too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.

HAN
Luke! Where's Leia?

LUKE	 (concerned)
What? She didn't come back?

HAN
I thought she was with you.

LUKE
We got separated.

Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.

LUKE
Hey, we better go look for her.

Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.

HAN
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

LUKE
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the 
squad proceeds in another.

THREEPIO
Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.

They move off into the woods.

THREEPIO	 (to Artoo)
And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into 
view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat 
puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this 
frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up 
and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where 
she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and 
disheveled.

The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a 
defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins 
poking her with the sharp point of the spear.

LEIA
Cut it out!

She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.

LEIA
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of 
her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.

LEIA
Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here 
is.

She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from 
her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log 
beside her.

LEIA
Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.

Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia 
pats the log again.

LEIA
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.

More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.

LEIA
All right. You want something to eat?

She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. 
Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously 
toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.

LEIA
That's right. Come on. Hmmm?

Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the 
log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps 
back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her 
and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.

LEIA
Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery 
little thing, aren't you?

Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming 
to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to 
sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning 
to Leia.

LEIA
What is it?

Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log 
next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding 
behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears 
underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the 
forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL 
SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches 
out his hand for her weapon.

SCOUT #l
Freeze!  Come on, get up!

She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage 
in front of the log.

SCOUT #1
Go get your ride and take her back to base.

SCOUT #2
Yes, sir.

The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the 
log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout 
jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. 
Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, 
and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and 
hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's 
bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once 
more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards 
Leia withÊnew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking 
around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the 
dense foliage.

LEIA
Come on, let's get outta here.

As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and 
tugs at Leia to follow him.

68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER

Darth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private 
elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.

GUARD
Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.

VADER        
(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the 
Force)
The Emperor will see me, now!

GUARD
(repeating Vader's command)
The Emperor will see you, now.

69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Two red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens 
to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It 
appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He 
waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark 
Lord.

EMPEROR
I told you to remain on the command ship.

VADER
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

EMPEROR	 (no surprise)
Yes, I know.

VADER	 (after a beat)
My son is with them.

EMPEROR	 (very cool)
Are you sure?

VADER
I have felt him, my Master.

EMPEROR
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are 
clear, Lord
Vader.

Vader knows what is being asked.

VADER
They are clear, my Master.

EMPEROR
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

VADER	 (skeptical)
He will come to me?

EMPEROR
I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will 
come to you and
then you will bring him before me.

VADER	 (bows)
As you wish.

The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.

70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

Han, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move 
through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. 
Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.

HAN	 (OS)
Luke! Luke!

Luke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage 
of a speeder bike in the grass.

THREEPIO
Oh, Master Luke.

LUKE
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.

He tosses the helmet to Han.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.

HAN	 (gravely)
I hope she's alright.

Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off 
through the foliage.

                              HAN
What, Chewie? What? Chewie!

The others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, 
Artoo whistles nervously.

71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE

The group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a 
tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from 
it.

HAN
Hey, I don't get it.

The rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.

HAN	 (cont)
Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.

Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.

LUKE
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!

Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. 
SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, 
suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of 
beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a 
jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.

HAN
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.

LUKE
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this 
thing. 
(trying to free an arm) 
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

HAN
Yeah, sure.

Artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting 
appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an 
arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to 
spin.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-
op!!

Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, 
crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they 
realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long 
spear.

HAN
Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.

Han pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok 
warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face. 
He grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.

HAN
Hey!

LUKE
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets 
them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.

LUKE
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.

Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free 
of the net and sits up, rattled.

THREEPIO
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!

When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among 
themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok 
nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In 
a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled 
bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks 
begin to chant at Threepio.

LUKE
Do you understand anything they're saying?

THREEPIO
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million 
forms of
communication.

HAN
What are you telling them?

THREEPIO
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive 
dialect.  But
I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange 
"what next?" looks.

HAN
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?

THREEPIO
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

HAN
Proper?!

THREEPIO
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.

HAN
Why, you--

Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their 
god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a 
menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands 
placatingly.

HAN
My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS

A procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their 
prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and 
wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.

Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the 
captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the 
remaining creatures.

73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST

The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the 
giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into 
nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts 
and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes 
hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other 
Ewoks follow suit.

74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE

The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks 
gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the 
newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.

Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is 
placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others 
are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne is gently 
placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and 
Chewie are less than fascinated.

HAN
I have a really bad feeling about this.

Chewie growls his concern.

Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes 
out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join 
Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A 
larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber 
with great curiosity.

Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing 
to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit 
under Han with firewood.

HAN
What did he say?

THREEPIO
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the 
main course at a
banquet in my honor.

The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. 
Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening 
at the same moment the prisoners see her.

HAN and LUKE
Leia!

As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.

LEIA
Oh!

THREEPIO
Your Royal Highness.

Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the 
assembled Ewoks and sighs.

LEIA
But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.

Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads 
negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks 
some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue 
with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .

HAN
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.

LUKE
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry 
and use your magic.

THREEPIO
But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --

LUKE
Just tell them.

Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps 
forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to 
concentrate.

THREEPIO
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...

Now the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the 
ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.

THREEPIO
... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! 
Oh!

The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio 
begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio 
calling out in total panic at his situation.

THREEPIO
Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! 
Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!

Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and 
release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group 
embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at 
him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. 
Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. 
When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo 
beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, 
finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The 
Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group 
of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and 
marveling at his height.

THREEPIO
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.

LUKE
Thanks, Threepio.

THREEPIO	 (still shaken)
I...I never knew I had it in me.

75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS

A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, 
creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a 
group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. 
The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the 
two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.

Threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's 
squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally 
murmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the 
Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, 
mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. 
Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable 
in English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-
Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.

THREEPIO
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.

Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han 
Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.

At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in 
agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.

The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer 
and screeches.

HAN
What's going on?

LEIA
I don't know.

Luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something 
passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not 
notice.

THREEPIO
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.

Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.

HAN
Just what I always wanted.

Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket 
clings to Han's leg.

HAN	 (chuckles)
Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. 
(to Wicket) 
Thank you. Okay.

THREEPIO
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield 
generator.

Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders 
outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.

HAN
Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try 
and get our weapons back.

Han pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.

HAN	 (cont)
And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT

The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and 
flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft 
night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands 
staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.

LEIA
Luke, what's wrong?

Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.

LUKE
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

LEIA
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

LUKE
What do you remember?

LEIA
Just...images, really. Feelings.

LUKE
Tell me.

LEIA
(a little surprised at his insistence)
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
(looks up)
Why are you asking me all this?

He looks away.

LUKE
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

LEIA
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

LUKE
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

LEIA	 (alarmed)
How do you know?

LUKE
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. 
That's why I have to go.
(facing her)
As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.
(beat)
I have to face him.

Leia is distraught, confused.

LEIA
Why?

Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.

LUKE
He's my father.

LEIA
Your father?

LUKE
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I 
don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.

LEIA
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and 
could never have.

LUKE
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to 
use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has 
it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she 
doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.

LUKE
Yes. It's you Leia.

LEIA
I know. Somehow...I've always known.

LUKE
Then you know why I have to face him.

LEIA
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave 
this place. I wish I could go with you.

LUKE
No, you don't. You've always been strong.

LEIA
But, why must you confront him?

LUKE
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to 
the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I 
have to try.

They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.

Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He 
disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed 
in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and 
comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only 
now that she is crying.

HAN
Hey, what's goin' on?

Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.

LEIA
Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.

HAN	 (angry)
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?

She looks up at him, struggling to control herself.

LEIA
I...I can't tell you.

HAN	 (loses his temper)
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?

LEIA
I...

HAN
Ahhh...

He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.

HAN
I'm sorry.

LEIA
Hold me.

Han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.

77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM

An Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands 
gracefully on the huge platform.

Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of 
the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks 
particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.

78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK

Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into 
an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward 
another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, 
in binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with 
complete calm.

COMMANDER
This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I 
believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct 
a further search of the area.

The commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.

COMMANDER
He was armed only with this.

Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the 
lightsaber from the commander's hand.

VADER
Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his 
companions to me.

COMMANDER
Yes, my Lord.

The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone 
in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest 
filter in upon them.

VADER
The Emperor has been expecting you.

LUKE
I know, father.

VADER
So, you have accepted the truth.

LURE
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

VADER	 (turning to face him)
That name no longer has any meaning for me.

LUKE
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there 
is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is 
why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your 
Emperor now.

Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved 
hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.

VADER	 (indicating lightsaber)
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, 
brilliant blade.

VADER
Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has 
foreseen.

They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.

LUKE
Come with me.

VADER
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.

VADER
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.

LUKE
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

VADER
If that is your destiny.

LUKE
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict 
within you. Let go
of your hate.

VADER
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature 
of the Force. He is
your master now.

Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring 
at one another for a long moment.

LUKE
Then my father is truly dead.

79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR

Han, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout, 
PAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield 
generator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing 
platform. Leia studies the installation.

LEIA
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that 
landing platform. This
isn't gonna be easy.

HAN
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily 
guarded than this.

Wicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to 
Threepio.

LEIA
What's he saying?

THREEPIO
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star 
Cruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a 
spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.

81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some 
getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando 
speaks into his comlink.

LANDO
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

ACKBAR 	(VO)
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

Lando turns to his weird copilot.

LANDO
Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down 
on time...
(to himself) 
or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.

The copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.

ACKBAR	 (VO)
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

LANDO
All right. Stand by.

He pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.

82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

We are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then 
Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS 
INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.

83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and 
Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is 
spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that 
leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes 
parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an 
observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.

HAN
Back door, huh? Good idea.

Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.

HAN	 (cont)
It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.

LEIA
Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.

HAN	 (with self-confident grin)
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

Threepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks 
chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers 
into the underbrush.

Threepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.

THREEPIO
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

LEIA
Quiet.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.

LEIA
Oh, no.

84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE

Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial 
scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto 
one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at 
random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. 
Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in 
surprise.

85   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.

HAN 	(sighs)
There goes our surprise attack.

86   EXT BUNKER

The Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into 
motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.

SCOUT
Look! Over there! Stop him!

Three of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away 
in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.

87   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.

HAN
Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. 
We'll take care of this.

Han and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker. 
Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.

THREEPIO
I have decided that we shall stay here.

88   EXT FOREST

Paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, 
but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him 
and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds 
a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the 
trees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the 
still-flying, unoccupied bike.

89   EXT BUNKER

Han sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the 
shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms 
of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps 
out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out 
of sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No 
sign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout 
behind.

90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk 
across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side 
by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.

EMPEROR
Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.

Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down 
at Luke's binders.

EMPEROR
You no longer need those.

The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders 
fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, 
free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.

EMPEROR
Guards, leave us.

The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.

EMPEROR	 (to Luke)
I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call 
me Master.

LUKE
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.

The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. 
The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can 
perceive the evil visage within the hood.

EMPEROR
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are 
mistaken...about a great many things.

VADER
His lightsaber.

Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's 
lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.

EMPEROR
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know 
your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with 
you.

LUKE
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

The Emperor laughs.

EMPEROR
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.

Luke looks up sharply.

EMPEROR
Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.

Vader looks at Luke.

LUKE
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

EMPEROR
Your faith in your friends is yours.

VADER
It is pointless to resist, my son.

The Emperor turns to face Luke.

EMPEROR	 (angry)
Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. 
(indicates Endor)
Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...

Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.

EMPEROR	 (cont)
...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who 
allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It 
is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my 
best troops awaits them.

Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword 
in the Emperor's hand.

EMPEROR
Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when 
your friends arrive.

91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and 
enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.

HAN
All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.

The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. 
Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.

LEIA
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.

HAN
Charges!  Come on, come on!

Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more 
controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at 
the door.

THREEPIO	 (to Wicket)
Oh, my! They'll be captured!

Wicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into 
the forest.

THREEPIO
Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.

Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial 
commander enters.

COMMANDER
Freeze! You Rebel scum.

Han and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them 
and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them. 
Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent. 
Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.

92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET

The Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the 
Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The 
Millennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the 
space armada bears down on its target.

93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.

LANDO
All wings report in.

WEDGE
Red Leader standing by.

GRAY LEADER
Gray Leader standing by.

GREEN LEADER
Green Leader standing by.

WEDGE
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

From the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar 
watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.

ACKBAR
May the Force be with us.

95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to 
the control panel and talks to Lando.

LANDO
We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up 
or down. Well, how
could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.

Lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the 
implications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his 
comlink.

LANDO
Break off the attack! The shield is still up.

RED LEADER	 (VO)
I get no reading. Are you sure?

LANDO
Pull up! All craft pull up!

The Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the 
Death Star move off right.

96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD

The Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid 
the unseen wall.

97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Alarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes 
course abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the 
armada tries to halt its forward momentum.

ACKBAR
Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.

A Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to 
Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.

CONTROLLER
Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

On the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive 
Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.

ACKBAR
It's a trap!

LANDO	 (over comlink)
Fighters coming in.

There is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.

The Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an 
armada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in 
and around the giant Rebel cruisers.

REBEL PILOT
There's too many of them!

LANDO
Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader.

The battle continues around the giant cruisers.

98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

Through the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the 
distant flashes of the space battle in progress.

EMPEROR
Come, boy. See for yourself.

The Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side. 
Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.

EMPEROR
From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and 
the end of your insignificant Rebellion.

Luke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest 
of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the 
lightsaber.

EMPEROR
You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your 
Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to 
your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my 
servant.

Vader watches Luke in his agony.

LUKE
No!

EMPEROR
It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now 
mine!

99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the 
bunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now 
crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial 
troops. The situation looks hopeless.

STORMTROOPER
All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!

From the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps 
and whistles. 
And --

THREEPIO
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?

BUNKER COMMANDER
Bring those two down here!

STORMTROOPER
Let's go!

Artoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six 
Imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids 
duck out of sight behind the tree.

THREEPIO
Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?

STORMTROOPER
Freeze! Don't move!

THREEPIO
We surrender.

The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting 
quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a 
band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.

THREEPIO
Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.

In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK 
ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their 
fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and 
their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting 
Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the 
trees above.

In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for 
the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes 
to the bunker door control panel.

LEIA
The code's changed. We need Artoo!

HAN
Here's the terminal.

LEIA	 (into comlink)
Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.

Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround 
them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of 
whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, 
runs after him.

THREEPIO
Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? 
No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the 
little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.

A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They 
fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns 
and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks 
abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker 
moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge 
logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.

A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's 
foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged 
behind.

Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts 
round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between 
two trees.

100  EXT SPACE

The Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat 
with Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the 
Rebel armada.

101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
Lando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel 
squads.

LANDO
Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!

WEDGE
Red Three, Red Two, pull in!

RED TWO
Got it!

RED THREE
Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!

WEDGE
Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical 
frigate.

Lando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at 
the TIEs from the belly guns.

NAVIGATOR
Pressure's steady.

The copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.

LANDO
Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers 
are waiting for.

102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET  

The giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the 
battle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of 
the fleet.

103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge 
window of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.

COMMANDER
We're in attack position now, sir.

PIETT
Hold here.

COMMANDER
We're not going to attack?

PIETT
I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special 
planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

The Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle 
fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship 
explodes against the protective shield.

EMPEROR
As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now 
witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle 
station.
(into comlink)
Fire at will, Commander.

Luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the 
Rebel fleet beyond.

105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands 
over them.

JERJERROD
Fire!

106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

A button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded 
Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of 
light emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side 
at a control panel.

107  EXT DEATH STAR

The giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to 
glow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.

108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings 
dogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is 
hit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.

The Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE 
fighters.

109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser. 
Lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star 
firepower.

LANDO
That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational! 
(into comlink)
Home One, this is Gold Leader.

110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the 
comlink.

ACKBAR
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

LANDO
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

ACKBAR
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel 
firepower of that magnitude.

LANDO
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Artoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover 
fire.

THREEPIO
We're coming!

HAN
Come on! Come on!

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo, hurry!

The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A 
large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally 
landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and 
smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn 
around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his 
appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in 
his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded 
companion.

THREEPIO
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

HAN
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

LEIA
I'll cover you.

Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the 
stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the 
wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting 
laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are 
struck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then 
realizes that he is dead.

112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR

The Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death 
Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star 
Destroyers.

113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating 
giants. He's been yelling into the comlink.

LANDO	 (desperately)
Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star 
Destroyers at point-
blank range.

ACKBAR
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

LANDO
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might 
just take a few of
them with us.

The Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and 
begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the 
giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.

The control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.

REBEL PILOT
She's gonna blow!

Y-WING PILOT
I'm hit!

The damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into 
the control tower, exploding.

114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Out of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being 
decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there 
is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.

EMPEROR
Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not 
survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will 
die...as will your friends.

Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.

EMPEROR
Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! 
Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark 
side will be complete.

Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He 
ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber 
flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the 
Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his 
father.

115  EXT FOREST

The battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated 
weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the 
Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.

A walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An 
Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The 
logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until 
it finally topples over with a great crash.

A scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end 
of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-
tightening circles until it runs out of rope and
crashes into the trees with a huge explosion.

Chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks 
cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, 
then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.

WALKER PILOT #1
Look!

PILOT #2
Get him off of there!

The walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked 
out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into 
the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are 
thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, 
Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch 
with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to 
listen to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.

Chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at 
unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The 
Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the 
battle in their favor.

116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to 
hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some 
stormtroopers.

HAN
I think I got it. I got it!

The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a 
second blast door crashes down in front of the first.

Han frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with 
stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her 
shoulder hit by a laser blast.

THREEPIO
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

HAN
Let's see.

LEIA
It's not bad.

STORMTROOPER	 (OS)
Freeze!

They freeze.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear.

STORMTROOPER
Don't move!

Leia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two 
stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment 
seems suspended in time.

HAN
I love you.

Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.

LEIA
I know.

STORMTROOPER
Hands up! Stand up!

Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She 
disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward 
Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, 
its deadly weapons aimed right at him.

HAN	 (to Leia)
Stay back.

The hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and 
barks triumphantly.

HAN
Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.

117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even 
more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown 
stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is 
forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke 
stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.

EMPEROR (laughing)
Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through 
you.

Luke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and 
realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his 
lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.

VADER
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

LUKE
I will not fight you, father.

Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.

VADER
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in 
an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader 
stands below him.

LUKE
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the 
conflict.

VADER
There is no conflict.

LUKE
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe 
you'll destroy me
now.

VADER
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, 
then you will meet
your destiny.

Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding 
the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground 
in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's 
platform. Vader moves to find him.

EMPEROR	 (laughs)
Good.  Good.

118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each 
other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer 
explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a 
series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next 
to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the 
Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack 
one of the larger Imperial ships.

LANDO
Watch out. Squad at .06.

REBEL PILOT
I'm on it, Gold Leader.

WEDGE
Good shot, Red Two.

LANDO
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an 
Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and 
interference.

HAN/PILOT	 (VO)
It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into 
the woods. We
need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.

The controllers cheer.

CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER
Send three squads to help. Open the back door.

SECOND COMMANDER
Yes, sir.

120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

As the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, 
they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their 
weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the 
roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns
as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.

121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Han, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant 
explosive charges on the control panels and rush out.

HAN
Throw me another charge.

122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, 
searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.

VADER
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

LUKE
I will not fight you.

VADER
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your 
friends. Yes, your
thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially 
for...

Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in 
anguish.

VADER
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed 
her, too. Obi-Wan
was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will 
not turn to the dark
side, then perhaps she will.

LUKE
Never-r-r!

Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather 
with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader 
fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of 
the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. 
Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.

The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to 
block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the 
wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical 
stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the
edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves 
over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. 
The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.

EMPEROR
Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and 
take your father's
place at my side!

Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, 
black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his 
father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in 
preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.

LUKE
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 
I am a Jedi,
like my father before me.

The Emperor's glee turns to rage.

EMPEROR
So be it...Jedi.

123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across 
the clearing.

HAN
Move! Move!

A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a 
spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes 
along with the bunker.

124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.

ACKBAR
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.

LANDO
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. 
(laughs)
Told you they'd do it!

The Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward 
the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.

125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The 
Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.

EMPEROR
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.

Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's 
hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the 
Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a 
moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the 
young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader 
struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.

EMPEROR
Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.

Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the 
Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into 
the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.

EMPEROR
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You 
have paid the price for
your lack of vision.

Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward 
where Vader stands watching.

LUKE	 (groans)
Father, please. Help me.

Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, 
then back to Luke on the floor.

EMPEROR
Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts 
from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound 
screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.

Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed 
figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. 
The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now 
lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to 
strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his 
helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high 
over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of 
the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, 
Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.

The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls 
into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it 
explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is 
whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the 
bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away 
from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant 
warrior are too weak to move.

126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR

Rebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star 
to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of 
the giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.

WEDGE
I'm going in.

LANDO
Here goes nothing.

Three X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed 
by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who 
continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as 
they race through the dark shaft.

LANDO
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power 
generator.

WEDGE
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

The fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by 
the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.

LANDO
Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of 
those TIE fighters to
follow you.

PILOT
Copy, Gold Leader.

The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and 
Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon 
scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast 
away at them.

LANDO
That was too close.

Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages 
on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.

127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

ACKBAR
We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on 
that Super Star Destroyer.

X-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.

128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the 
battle. They look concerned.

CONTROLLER
Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

PIETT
Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.

The commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel 
fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.

PIETT
Intensify forward firepower!

COMMANDER
It's too late!

The Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a 
huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the 
Death Star, and explodes.

129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

There is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides. 
They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.

130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

Chaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as 
the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading 
a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and 
desperate to escape.

In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous 
deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle. 
Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as 
Vader draws him closer.

VADER	 (a whisper)
Luke, help me take this mask off.

LURE
But you'll die.

VADER
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my 
own eyes.

Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There 
beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the 
dying man smiles at the sight before him.

ANAKIN	 (very weak)
Now...go, my son. Leave me.

LUKE
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save 
you.

ANAKIN
You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you 
were right.

LUKE
Father...I won't leave you.

Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.

A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half 
carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a 
shuttle.

131  EXT DEATH STAR

The Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense 
superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers 
outside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is 
answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station 
itself.

132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS

Lando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing 
Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor 
shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.

WEDGE
There it is!

LANDO
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

The X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several 
proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small 
explosions.

The Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously 
close, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a 
powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.

He maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of 
the continuing chain of explosions.

133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge, 
watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing 
room.

ACKBAR
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

134  EXT DEATH STAR

An Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the 
main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown 
away.

Finally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando 
expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and 
whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star 
supernovas into oblivion.

135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.

136  EXT ENDOR FOREST

Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all 
look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of 
self-destruction. They all cheer.

THREEPIO
They did it!

Han looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face. 
Leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent 
voice.

HAN
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

LEIA
He wasn't. I can feel it.

HAN
You love him, don't you?

Leia smiles, puzzled.

LEIA
Yes.

HAN
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the 
way.

She realizes his misunderstanding.

LEIA
Oh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.

Han is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.

137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT

Luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his 
father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands, 
watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader -- 
Anakin Skywalker.

In the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the 
forest.

138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

A huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and 
Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing, 
dancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and 
liberation.

Lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then, 
finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him. 
They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's 
touch, together to the end.

Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original 
group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems 
distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.

He looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at 
the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.

EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots 
from its underside.  

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.  

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A 
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the 
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the 
snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled 
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving 
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged 
beast.

The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling 
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the 
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and 
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.

The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink 
transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han, 
		old buddy, do you read me?

After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Well, I finished my circle.  I 
		don't pick up any life readings.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		There isn't enough life on this 
		ice cube to fill a space cruiser.  
		The sensors are placed, I'm going 
		back.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Right.  I'll see you shortly.  
		There's a meteorite that hit the 
		ground near here.  I want to check 
		it out.  It won't take long.

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.  
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.

				LUKE
		Hey, steady girl.  What's the 
		matter?  You smell something?

Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when 
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a 
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over 
him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.

				LUKE
		Aaargh!

Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white 
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified 
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck 
being broken.

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away 
across the frozen plain.

EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY

A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous 
ice cave.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing 
their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls 
off his goggles.

He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which 
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various 
other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his 
Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie 
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated 
greeting to his boss.

				HAN
		Chewie!

The Wookiee grumbles a reply.

				HAN
		All right, don't lose your temper.
		I'll come right back and give you 
		a hand.

Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han 
leaves.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick 
ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, 
troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and 
monitoring radar signals.

General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.

				RIEEKAN
		Solo?

				HAN
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll 
know if anything comes around.

				RIEEKAN
		Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

				HAN
		No.  He's checking out a meteorite 
		that hit near him.

				RIEEKAN
			(indicates radar 
			 screen)
		With all the meteor activity in this
		system, it's going to be difficult 
		to spot approaching ships.

Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.

				HAN
		General, I've got to leave.  I 
		can't stay anymore.

Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short 
white combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in 
a Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat 
distressed.

				RIEEKAN
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				HAN
		Well, there's a price on my head.
		If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut, 
		I'm a dead man.

				RIEEKAN
		A death mark's not an easy thing 
		to live with.  You're a good
		fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

				HAN
		Thank you, General.

He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.

				HAN
			(with feeling)
		Well, Your Highness, I guess this 
		is it.

				LEIA
		That's right.

Leia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his 
head and adopts a sarcastic tone.

				HAN
			(cooly)
		Well, don't get all mushy on me.
		So long, Princess.

Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.  
Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

				LEIA
		Han!

Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.

				HAN
		Yes, Your Highnessness?

				LEIA
		I thought you decided to stay.

				HAN
		Well, the bounty hunter we ran 
		into on Ord Mantell changed my
		mind.  

				LEIA
		Han, we need you!

				HAN
		We?

				LEIA
		Yes.

				HAN
		Oh, what about you need?

				LEIA
			(mystified)
		I need?  I don't know what you're 
		talking about.

				HAN
			(shakes his head, 
			 fed up) 
		You probably don't.

				LEIA
		And what precisely am I supposed 
		to know?

				HAN
		Come on!  You want me to stay 
		because of the way you feel about
		me.

				LEIA
		Yes.  You're a great help to us.
		You're a natural leader...

				HAN
		No!  That's not it.  Come on.  
		Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.

				LEIA
You're imagining things.

				HAN
		Am I?  Then why are you following 
		me?  Afraid I was going to leave
		without giving you a goodbye kiss?

				LEIA
		I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

				HAN
		I can arrange that.  You could use 
		a good kiss!

Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-
Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an 
ice wall toward the main hangar.

				THREEPIO
		Don't try to blame me.  I didn't 
		ask you to turn on the thermal 
		heater.  I merely commented that it 
		was freezing in the princess' 
		chamber.  But it's supposed to be 
		freezing.  How are we going to dry 
		out all her clothes?  I really don't 
		know.

Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, switch off.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.  Han and Chewie are 
struggling with their central lifters.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Why do you take this apart now? 
		I'm trying to get us out of here 
		and you pull both of these.

Chewie grumbles in irritation.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Put them back together right now.

				THREEPIO
		Might I have a word with you, 
		please?

				HAN
		What do you want?

				THREEPIO
		Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
		She's been trying to get you on 
		the communicator.

				HAN
		I turned it off.  I don't want to 
		talk to her.

				THREEPIO
		Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering 
		about Master Luke.  He hasn't come 
		back yet.  She doesn't know where he 
		is.

				HAN
		I don't know where he is.

				THREEPIO
		Nobody knows where he is.

				HAN
		What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as 
night slowly begins to fall on the planet.

				THREEPIO
		Well, uh, you see...

Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.

				HAN
		Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer 
approaches.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir?

				HAN
		Do you know where Commander 
		Skywalker is?

				DECK OFFICER
		I haven't seen him.  It's possible 
		he came in through the south entrance.

				HAN
		It's possible?  Why don't you go 
		find out?  It's getting dark out there.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir.

The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's 
mouth.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire 
		what's going on?

				HAN
		Why not?

				THREEPIO
		Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo, 
		let's find Princess Leia.  Between 
		ourselves, I think Master Luke is 
		in considerable danger.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL

The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the 
tunnel.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't 
		come in through the south entrance.
		He might have forgotten to check in.

				HAN
		Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

				DECK OFFICER
		Not yet.  We're having some trouble 
		adapting them to the cold.

				HAN
		Then we'll have to go out on 
		Tauntauns.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, the temperature's dropping too 
		rapidly.

				HAN
		That's right.  And my friends out 
		in it.

				ASSISTANT OFFICER
		I'll cover sector twelve.  Have 
		com-control set screen alpha.

Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.

				DECK OFFICER
		Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you 
		reach the first marker.

				HAN
		Then I'll see you in hell!

Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter 
night.

EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK

The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of 
a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy 
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One 
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens 
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the 
gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and 
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.

Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, 
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about 
three feet out of reach.

He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he 
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.

Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into 
Luke's hand.

The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts 
himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The 
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke 
scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams 
in pain.

EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK

Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak 
and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK

A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile 
vastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up 
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.

EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE				 HANGAR - DUSK

Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves 
stiffly over to him.

				THREEPIO
		You must come along now, Artoo.  
		There's really nothing more we can 
		do.  And my joints are freezing up.

Artoo beeps, long and low.

				THREEPIO
		Don't say thing like that!  Of 
		course we'll see Master Luke again.
		He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
			(to himself)
		Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll 
		be quite all right.

Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully 
keeps his vigil.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

The wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright, 
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up, 
but he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple 
of feet and then collapses.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base, 
waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold 
wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the 
background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.  

A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with 
the princess.

				LIEUTENANT
		Sir, all the patrols are in.
		There's still no contact from 
		Skywalker or Solo.

				THREEPIO
		Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been 
		quite unable to pick up any signals, 
		although he does admit that his own 
		range is far too weak to abandon 
		all hope.

Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.

				DERLIN
		Your Highness, there's nothing 
		more we can do tonight.  The shield 
		doors must be closed.

He turns to the lieutenant.

				DERLIN
		Close the doors.

				LIEUTENANT
		Yes, sir.

The lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl, 
somewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex 
series of efficient beeps.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo says the chances of survival 
		are seven hundred seventy-five...
		to one.

Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the 
entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge 
cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.

				THREEPIO
		Actually, Artoo has been known to 
		make mistakes... from time to time.
		Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry 
		about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll 
		be all right.  He's quite clever, 
		you know... for a human being.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks 
up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is 
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.

				BEN
		Luke... Luke.

				LUKE
			(weakly)
		Ben?

				BEN
		You will go to the Dagobah system.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system?

				BEN
		There you will learn from Yoda, 
		the Jedi Master who instructed me.

The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching 
from the windswept horizon.

				LUKE
			(groaning faintly)
		Ben... Ben.

Luke drops into unconsciousness.

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered 
friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low, 
pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him 
urgently.

				HAN
		Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.  
		Come on, give me a sign here.

Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping 
Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a 
rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun 
stagger and then fall over into the snow.

Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the 
Tauntaun expires.

				HAN 
		Not much time.

He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Ben... Ben...

				HAN
		Hang on, kid.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system...

Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He 
quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's 
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

				HAN
			(reeling from the 
			 odor) 
		Whew...

				LUKE
		Dagobah...

				HAN
		This may smell bad, kid...

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Yoda...

				HAN
		...but it will keep you warm... 
		til I get the shelter built.
			(struggling to get 
			 Luke inside the 
			 carcass) 
		Ooh... I thought they smelled bad 
		on the outside!

The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han 
removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter 
container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection 
against a bitter Hoth night.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN

Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT

There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft.  He 
concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.  He hears a low beep 
from one of his monitors.

				ZEV
			(into transmitter) 
		Echo Base... I've got something!  Not 
		much, but it could be a life form.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT

The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new 
direction.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT

The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.

				ZEV
			(into transmitter)
		This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue 
		Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?  
		Commander Skywalker, do you copy? 
		This is Rogue Two.

There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.

				HAN
			(filtered over 
			 Zev's receiver)
		Good morning.  Nice of you guys 
		to drop by.

				ZEV
			(switching transmitters) 
		Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I 
		found them.  Repeat, I found them.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY

The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.  
A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots 
Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his 
arms frantically at the tiny craft.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch 
is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank 
filled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about, 
raving in delirium.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM

Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows 
terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the 
room.

				THREEPIO
		Master Luke, sir, it's so good 
		to see you fully functional again.

Artoo beeps his good wishes.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo expresses his relief, also.

Han and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting.

				HAN
		How are you feeling, kid?  You 
		don't look so bad to me.  In 
		fact, you look strong enough to 
		pull the ears off a Gundark.

				LUKE
		Thanks to you.

				HAN
		That's two you owe me, junior.

Han turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big, 
devilish grin.

				HAN
		Well your Worship, looks like 
		you managed to keep me around for
		a little while longer.

				LEIA
			(haughtily)
		I had nothing to do with it.  General 
		Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for 
		any ships to leave the system until 
		we've activated the energy shield.

				HAN
		That's a good story.  I think you 
		just can't bear to let a gorgeous 
		guy like me out of your sight.

				LEIA
		I don't know where you get your 
		delusions, laser brain.

Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself, 
regards Chewie good-humoredly.

				HAN
		Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you 
		didn't see us alone in the south 
		passage.

Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.

				HAN
		She expressed her true feelings 
		for me.

Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.

				LEIA
		My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
		witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
		herder!

				HAN
		Who's scruffy-looking? 
			(to Luke) 
		I must have hit pretty close to 
		the mark to get her all riled up 
		like that, huh, kid?

Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she 
focuses on Luke.

				LEIA
		Why, I guess you don't know 
		everything about women yet?

With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.  Then she turns 
on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly 
dumbstruck.  With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head 
and grins.

Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker)
		Headquarters personnel, report to 
		command center.

The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry 
out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.

				HAN
		Take it easy.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse us, please.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen.  He calls over to Leia 
and Han.

				RIEEKAN
		Princess... we have a visitor.

The group hurries over to Rieekan.

				RIEEKAN
		We've picked up something outside 
		the base in zone twelve, moving 
		east.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		It's metal.

				LEIA
		Then it couldn't be one of those 
		creatures that attacked Luke.

				HAN
		It could be a speeder, one of ours.

				SENIOR CONTROLLER
		No.  Wait - there's something very 
		weak coming through.

Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the 
strange signal.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I am fluent in six million 
		forms of communication.  This signal 
		is not used by the Alliance.  It 
		could be an Imperial code.

The transmission ends in static.

				HAN
		It isn't friendly, whatever it is.  
		Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

				RIEEKAN
		Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to 
		station three-eight.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-
eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.  It raises a large 
antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing 
signal.

The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has 
popped his head over a snow bank.  Instantly, the probe robot swings 
around, its deadly ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot 
off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million 
pieces.

Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the 
smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Afraid there's not much left.

				LEIA
			(into comlink)
		What was it?

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit 
		it that hard.  It must have had a 
		self-destruct.

				LEIA
			(into comlink)
		An Imperial probe droid.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		It's a good bet the Empire knows 
		we're here.

				RIEEKAN
		We'd better start the evacuation.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five 
Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of 
space.  The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller 
spacecraft.  TIE fighters dart to and fro.

INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK

Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear 
ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls.  The 
squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built 
General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the 
approaching presence and turn toward it.  Darth Vader, Lord of the 
Sith, enters like a chill wind.  As Vader moves across the wide bridge, 
Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.

				PIETT
		Admiral.

				OZZEL
		Yes, Captain

				PIETT
		I think we've got something, sir.  
		The report is only a fragment from 
		a probe droid in the Hoth system, 
		but it's the best lead we've had.

				OZZEL
			(irritated) 
		We have thousands of probe droids 
		searching the galaxy.  I want proof, 
		not leads!

				PIETT
		The visuals indicate life readings.

				OZZEL
		It could mean anything.  If we 
		followed every lead...

				PIETT
		But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed 
		to be devoid of human forms.

Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base.  
Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance.

				VADER
		You found something?

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
			(studying the image 
			 on the console screen) 
		That's it.  The Rebels are there.

				OZZEL
		My lord, there are so many uncharted 
		settlements.  It could be smugglers, 
		it could be...

				VADER
		That is the system.  And I'm sure 
		Skywalker is with them.  Set your 
		course for the Hoth system.  General 
		Veers, prepare you men.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - TRANSPORT BAY

A captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the 
main transport bay.  Several Rebel transports behind them are being 
loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in 
panic.

				REBEL CAPTAIN
		Groups seven and ten will stay 
		behind to fly the speeders.  As 
		soon as each transport is loaded, 
		evacuation control will give 
		clearance for immediate launch.

				REBEL FIGHTER
		Right, sir.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Alarms sound.  Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert 
stations.  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near 
the main entrance.

In the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the 
lifters of the Millennium Falcon.

Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.  He pulls out 
his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters.

				HAN
			(into comlink, to 
			 Chewie)
		Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off! 
		Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.  Exasperated, Han 
surveys the new damage.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical 
droid stands by.

				MEDICAL DROID
		Sir, it will take quite a while 
		to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.

				LUKE
		Well, forget the heavy equipment.
		There's plenty of time to get the 
		smaller modules on the transports.

				MEDICAL DROID
		Take care, sir.

				LUKE
		Thanks.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about.  Luke, pulling on his 
heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders.  He 
stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are 
trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.

				LUKE
		Chewie, take care of yourself, 
		okay?

As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and 
gives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair 
droid when he sees Luke.

				HAN
		Hi, kid.
			(to droid)
		There's got to be a reason for 
		it.  Check it at the other end.
		Wait a second.
			(to Luke)
		You all right?

				LUKE
		Yeah.

				HAN
		Be careful.

				LUKE
		You, too.

Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps, 
he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent 
communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things, 
all difficult to verbalize.

INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM.

Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base.  In the control room, a 
controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer 
scan.

				CONTROLLER
		General, there's a fleet of Star 
		Destroyers coming out of hyperspace 
		in sector four.

				RIEEKAN
		Reroute all power to the energy 
		shield.  We've got to hold them till 
		all transports are away.  Prepare 
		for ground assault.

Rieekan exits hurriedly.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE

The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls 
on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube.  
General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving 
Vader.  Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not 
bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord.  The younger general 
stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.

				VADER
		What is it, General?

				VEERS
		My lord, the fleet has moves out 
		of light-speed.  Com-Scan has 
		detected an energy field protecting 
		an area around the sixth planet of 
		the Hoth system.  The field is 
		strong enough to deflect any 
		bombardment.

				VADER
			(angrily)
		The Rebels are alerted to our 
		presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out 
		of light-speed too close to the 
		system.

				VEERS
		He felt surprise was wiser...

				VADER
		He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
		General, prepare your troops for a 
		surface attack.

				VEERS
		Yes, my lord.

Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen 
showing the bridge of his mighty ship.  Admiral Ozzel appears on the 
viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.

				OZZEL
		Lord Vader, the fleet has moved 
		out of light-speed, and we're 
		preparing to... Aaagh!

				VADER
		You have failed me for the last 
		time, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused, 
touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
Make ready to land out troops beyond 
the energy shield and deploy the 
fleet so that nothing gets off that 
system.  You are in command now, 
Admiral Piett.

				PIETT
		Thank you, Lord Vader.

Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed 
emotion.  He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a 
final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

With a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered 
in the center of the hangar.

				LEIA
		All troop carriers will assemble 
		at the north entrance.  The heavy 
		transport ships will leave as 
		soon as they're loaded.  Only two 
		fighter escorts per ship.  The 
		energy shield can only be opened 
		for a short time, so you'll have 
		to stay very close to your transports.

				HOBBIE
		Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

				LEIA
		The ion cannon will fire several 
		shots to make sure that any enemy 
		ships will be out of your flight 
		path.  When you've gotten past the 
		energy shield, proceed directly to 
		the rendezvous point.  Understood?

				PILOTS
			(in unison)
		Right.  Okay.

				LEIA
		Good luck.

				DERLIN
		Okay.  Everyone to your stations.  
		Let's go!

The pilots hurry away.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH - DAY

Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along 
the snow trench.  Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled 
orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold 
wind.

Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into 
position.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - POWER GENERATORS

Near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy 
battle equipment.  Buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking 
fingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

The long line of Rebel controllers is tense, as are Princess Leia and 
General Rieekan, who are trying very hard not to show any fear.

				RIEEKAN
		Their primary target will be the 
		power generators.  Prepare to 
		open the shield.

EXT. ICE PLAIN

The Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from 
the ice planet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

A huge Imperial Star Destroyer rest against a sea of stars, far above 
the white surface of the planet Hoth.

INT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

An Imperial controller approaches his commander.

				CONTROLLER
		Sir, Rebel ships are coming into 
		our sector.

				CAPTAIN
		Good.  Our first catch of the day.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

				WOMAN CONTROLLER
		Stand by, ion control... Fire!

EXT. REBEL BASE ICE CAVE - ION CANNON

The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two 
red energy beams skyward.

EXT. SPACE - HOTH - REBEL TRANSPORT

The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet, 
closely followed by the two red energy beams.

As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star 
Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts.  The 
Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful 
bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.

The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control.  As the 
Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away 
to safety.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their 
vehicles.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker)
		The first transport is away.

Everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar.  
Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder.  His gunner, 
Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him.  They climb in.

				DACK
		Feeling all right, sir?

				LUKE
		Just like new, Dack.  How about 
		you?

				DACK
		Right now I feel like I could take 
		on the whole Empire myself.

				LUKE
			(quietly, strapping 
			 in)
		I know what you mean.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN

A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.  Small dot-size 
objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the 
Rebel base.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through 
the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He 
adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the 
ominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the 
guns of the lumbering snow walkers.

The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding 
begins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is 
accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks 
into his comlink.

				TRENCH OFFICER
		Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

INT. REBEL BASE - CORRIDOR

Pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders.  Ice and snow 
begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding 
Imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer.

				TRENCH OFFICER
			(over comlink) 
		We have spotted Imperial walkers!

				CONTROLLER
Imperial walkers on the north 
ridge.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt 
all around them.  They are nervous and their grip on their weapons 
tightens from the cold and from fear.

Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Echo station Five-Seven.  We're 
		on our way.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle.  
They accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		All right, boys, keep tight now.

				DACK
		Luke, I have no approach vector.  
		I'm not set.

				LUKE
		Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern 
		delta.  Go now!

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders.  Other 
walkers loom in the background.  Two speeders race away past two of the 
enormous walkers and bank to the right.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		All right, I'm coming in.

He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying 
toward its towering legs.  The horizon twists as the speeder banks 
between the legs.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Hobbie, you still with me?

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly 
past it.

Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOWTRENCH

Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice 
explode all around them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other 
speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other 
Rebel craft race just above the icy plain.

A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and 
sending it crashing in a ball of flames.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing 
Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine 
forward.

Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads 
straight for its viewport, blasting away.  An explosion hits the walker 
window, but dissipates, doing no harm.  The speeder roars up and over 
the impregnable war machine.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance.

				LUKE
		That armor's too strong for 
		blasters.

On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit window, 
twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Rogue Group, use your harpoons 
		and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
		It might be our only chance of 
		stopping them.
			(to Dack)
		All right, stand by, Dack.

Dack is at the gunner's controls.

				DACK
		Luke, we've got a malfunction in 
		fire control.  I'll have to cut in 
		the auxiliary.

				LUKE
		Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get 
		ready to fire that tow cable.

Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up 
his harpoon gun.

Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker.  
Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course 
for the tiny craft.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Rogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the 
walker as explosions burst all around them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

After sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around to see if 
Dack is all right.

				LUKE
		Dack?  Dack!

Dack is lost.  Blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his 
smoldering controls.  Out the back window, an Imperial walker recedes 
in the distance.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH AREA

Rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around 
them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder between them 
explodes in a ball of flames.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Through the cockpit window, Veers and his pilot can see the Rebel power 
generators in the distance.

A hologram of Darth Vader appears on a control panel screen.

				VEERS
		Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the 
		main power generator.  The shield 
		will be down in moments.  You may 
		start your landing.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

		Copy, Rogue Leader

				LUKE 
			(over comlink) 
		Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll 
		have to make this shot.  I'll cover 
		for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE
			(to gunner) 
		Activate harpoon.

Wedge's gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the harpoon.  
The harpoon flashes out, and speeds toward the receding legs of the 
walker.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is embedded in 
one of the walker's legs.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				WEDGE 
			(to gunner) 
		Good shot, Janson.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder Rogue Three races around one of the giant walker's feet, 
trailing the cable behind it.  Continuing around the back foot, Rogue 
Three then circles the walker around the tail end.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the walker.

				WEDGE
		One more pass.

				JANSON 
		Coming around.  Once more.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the 
cable behind it.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				JANSON
		Once more.

Wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker.

				JANSON
		Cable out!  Let her go!

				WEDGE
		Detach cable.

EXT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE

The cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable 
drops away.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

				JANSON
		Cable detached.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder zooms away into the distance.  The tangled legs of the 
enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial 
walker begins to topple.  It teeters for a moment, and then crashes 
onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker.

An officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen 
war machine.

				TRENCH OFFICER
		Come on!

The troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders 
flying overhead.  Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the 
impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away from the 
fallen walker.

				WEDGE
			(into comlink) 
		Whooha!  That got him!

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		I see it, Wedge.  Good work.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia and General 
Rieekan monitor computer screens.

				RIEEKAN
		I don't think we can protect two 
		transports at a time.

				LEIA 
		It's risky, but we can't hold out 
		much longer.  We have no choice.

				RIEEKAN
			(into comlink) 
		Launch patrols.

				LEIA
			(to an aide) 
		Evacuate remaining ground staff.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of 
the hangar.  Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han 
works on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the 
wings.  Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient.

				HAN
		No, no!  No!  This one goes there, 
		that one goes there.  Right?

In another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up 
into Luke's X-wing fighter.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, you take good care of 
		Master Luke now, understand?  And
		... do take good care of yourself.  
		Oh, dear, oh, dear.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.  The 
Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base, 
firing lasers as they lumber ever onward.  In the snow trench, Rebel 
troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions 
erupt around them.  A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly 
explodes.  Another blast destroys a ray gun.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers studies various readouts on his control panel.

				VEERS
		All troops will debark for ground 
		assault.  Prepare to target the 
		main generator.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Luke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to 
left and flying above the erupting battlefield.  Flak bursts all around 
them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke, glancing over, sees Rogue Two on his left.  His ship shudders as 
flak bursts nearby.

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Rogue Two, are you all right?

INT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO - COCKPIT

				ZEV
			(into comlink) 
		Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

				LUKE
			(over comlink) 
		Stay tight and low.

EXT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO

Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rogue Two, when suddenly Zev's 
speeder is hit by a laser bolt.  His ship bucks violently under the 
impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame.

Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker.  Before 
they collide.  Rogue Two explodes in a million flaming pieces.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Desperately, Luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted ship.  
Suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion.  Luke struggles 
with the controls with a look of terror on his face.  The speeder fills 
with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit.

				LUKE
			(into comlink) 
		Hobbie, I've been hit!

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is 
strangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing 
hallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls 
and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the 
underground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a 
shambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a 
gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and 
Threepio near one of the control boards.

				HAN
		You all right?

Leia nods.  She is surprised to see him.

				LEIA
		Why are you still here?

				HAN
		I heard the command center had 
		been hit.

				LEIA
		You got your clearance to leave.

				HAN
		Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First 
		I'm going to get you to your ship.

				THREEPIO
		Your Highness, we must take this 
		last transport.  It's our only hope.

				LEIA
			(to controller) 
		Send all troops in sector twelve 
		to the south slope to protect the 
		fighters.

A blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio backward into Han's 
arms.

				ANNOUNCER
			(over loudspeaker) 
		Imperial troops have entered the 
		base.

				HAN
		Come on... that's it.

				LEIA
			(to head controller) 
		Give the evacuation code signal.  
		And get to your transports!

Leia looks exhausted.  Han grabs her and starts to lead her out.

As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code 
signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.

				HEAD CONTROLLER
		K-one-zero... all troops disengage.

				THREEPIO
			(to Han and Leia) 
		Oh!  Wait for me!

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SNOW TRENCH

Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught.

				OFFICER
		Begin retreat!

				SECOND OFFICER
		Fall back!

Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel 
headquarters.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW TRENCH

Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever 
nearer.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN

On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over 
him.  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing 
overhead.

Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at 
the walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the 
gun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.

Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his 
belt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling 
underneath the walker.

The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen 
snow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to 
the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke 
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.

He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the 
Imperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto 
the icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg 
passes by - and just misses him.

The giant walker stops in mid-step.  A muffled explosion comes from 
within - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every 
conceivable opening.  The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like 
a locomotive on stilts.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.  The 
smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right 
of Veers's path.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the Rebel power 
generators.

				VEERS
		Distance to power generators?

				PILOT
		One-seven, decimal two-eight.

Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main 
generator.

				VEERS
		Target.  Maximum fire power.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the 
relentless Imperial assault.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORS

With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling 
ice corridors.  Suddenly, there is an explosion.  Han turns, grabs the 
princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks 
their path.

He takes the comlink from his pocket.

				HAN 
			(into comlink) 
		Transport, this is Solo.  Better 
		take off - I can't get to you.  
		I'll get the princess out on the 
		Falcon.

Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor.

				THREEPIO
		But... but... but... where are 
		you going?  Uh... come back!!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Imperial troops have reached the base.  As they push through the 
blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the 
Millennium Falcon is docked.  Threepio still lags behind.

				THREEPIO
		Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

The door to the hangar closes in his face.

				THREEPIO
			(exasperated) 
		How typical.

Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid 
through.

				HAN
		Come on.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.  
The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a 
few reassuring words.  As he searches worriedly for his captain, 
something at last catches his eye.

Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward 
the ship.  The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl, 
then runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, 
closely followed by Threepio.

				HAN
		Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're 
		going to be a permanent resident!

				THREEPIO
		Wait!  Wait!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Imperial troops run through the base corridors.  Vader surveys the 
place.  A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but  he calmly, 
purposefully, continues around it.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck.  Ice cakes come 
crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD

Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as 
Chewie watches a troublesome gauge.  A worried Leia observes their 
efforts.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		How's this?

The Wookiee barks a negative reply.

				LEIA
		Would it helped if I got out and 
		pushed?

				HAN
		It might.

Threepio clanks into the hold.

				THREEPIO
		Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, 
		might I suggest that you...

Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.

				THREEPIO
		It can wait.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches.  Leia 
watches him, impatient, disbelieving.

				LEIA
		This bucket of bolts is never going 
		to get us past that blockade.

				HAN
		This baby's got a few surprises 
		left in her, sweetheart.

Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of 
stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.

Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the 
navigator's chair.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon.  Behind them 
the giant hangar doors open slowly.

EXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the 
Imperial troops.

The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by 
the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie rushes into the cockpit.

				HAN
		Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
		Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

A laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair.  
Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and 
the first stage of engine fire can be heard.  Han flashes a big grin at 
Leia.

				HAN
		See?

				LEIA
		Someday you're going to be wrong, 
		and I hope I'm there to see it.

Han looks at Chewie.

				HAN
		Punch it!

The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice-
cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader.  
Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks 
toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and 
disappear outside the cave.

EXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY

Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above 
them, flying very close to the ground.

The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing 
fighters, each going to his own ship.  Luke waves farewell, then heads 
toward his own fighter.  

Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke 
climbs aboard the spacecraft.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for 
takeoff.

				WEDGE
		Good luck, Luke.  See you at 
		the rendezvous.

Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of 
his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.

				LUKE
		Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going, 
		we're going.

The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.  
Soon it disappears into the stars.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision.  He flips several 
switches.  The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn.  
The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction.

The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from 
the concerned Artoo.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
		I'm just setting a new course.

Artoo beeps once again.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		We're not going to regroup with 
		the others.

Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What?!"

Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		We're going to the Dagobah system.

Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along 
with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.  
Finally, Artoo chirps up.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, Artoo?

Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.

				LUKE
			(into comlink, chuckling)
		That's all right.  I'd like to 
		keep it on manual control for a 
		while.

The little droid lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke smiles, and 
continues on his course.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one 
huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.

As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized 
objects.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl.  Han checks as the 
ship is buffeted by exploding flak.  He appears to be doing six things 
at once.

				HAN
			(harried)
		I saw them!  I saw them!

				LEIA
		Saw what?

				HAN
		Star Destroyers, two of them, 
		coming right at us.

Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...

				HAN
			(to Leia)
		Shut him up or shut him down!
			(to Chewie)
		Check the deflector shield!

Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.

				HAN
		Oh, great.  Well, we can still 
		outmaneuver them.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS

The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight 
down, closely followed by four TIE fighters.  The underside of the Star 
Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star 
Destroyers.  Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen 
veering to the left.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		Take evasive action!

Alarms sound all over the huge ship.  The two other Star Destroyers get 
closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes 
brushing contact with it.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS

The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers, 
still followed by four TIE fighters.  Laser bolts spark the pitch-black 
skies.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.  Chewie 
barks at Han.  Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive.  
The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.

				HAN
		Prepare to make the jump to light-
		speed.

				THREEPIO
		But, sir!

The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.

				LEIA
		They're getting closer!

				HAN
			(with a gleam in his 
			 eye)
		Oh yeah?  Watch this.

Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into 
hyperspace, but just sit there.

Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of 
concern.

				LEIA
		Watch what?

Han tries again.  Still nothing.

				HAN
		I think we're in trouble.

				THREEPIO
		If I may say so, sir, I noticed 
		earlier that the hyperdrive 
		motivator has been damaged.  It's 
		impossible to go to light-speed!

				HAN
		We're in trouble!

The explosions become heavier.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER

The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four 
Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders 
to Chewie.

				HAN
		Horizontal boosters...!
			(Chewie barks)
		Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's 
		not it.
			(Chewie barks)
		Bring me the hydrospanners!

Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.

				HAN
		I don't know how we're going to 
		get out of this one.

Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch 
radically.  Chewie barks.  The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.

				HAN
		Oww!  Chewie!

More turbulence rocks the ship.

				HAN
		That was no laser blast!  Something 
		hit us.

				LEIA
			(over comlink)
		Han, get up here!

				HAN
		Come on, Chewie!

Han climbs out of the hold like a shot.  Both he and Chewie run out of 
the hold and toward the cockpit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.

				LEIA
		Asteroids!

Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie 
gets into his chair.  Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses 
in front of the ship.

				HAN
		Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
		one.

				LEIA
		What are you doing?  You're not 
		actually going into an asteroid 
		field?

				HAN
		They'd be crazy to follow us, 
		wouldn't they?

Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.

				LEIA
		You don't have to do this to 
		impress me.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, the possibility of successfully 
		navigating an asteroid field is 
		approximately three thousand, seven 
		hundred and twenty to one.

				HAN
		Never tell me the odds!

EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its 
turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.

A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed.  
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small 
explosions on its surface.  Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in 
every direction, some colliding and exploding.  The tiny Millennium 
Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain 
of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the 
asteroids.

One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and 
explodes.  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of 
smaller explosions.

Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly 
banks around both of them.  The three TIE fighters follow in hot 
pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out 
of control into deep space.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT

The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the 
Falcon.  Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT

The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.  
Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft 
through the dangerous field.

Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid 
drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.

Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially 
close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch.  
Threepio's hands cover his eyes.  He manages a short peek at the 
cockpit window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.  
Han gives her a quick look.

				HAN
		You said you wanted to be around 
		when I made a mistake; well, this 
		could be it, sweetheart.

				LEIA
		I take it back.  We're going to 
		get pulverized if we stay out here 
		much longer.

The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.

				HAN
		I'm not going to argue with that.

				THREEPIO
		Pulverized?

				HAN
		I'm going in closer to one of 
		those big ones.

				LEIA
		Closer?

				THREEPIO
		Closer?!

Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized 
asteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the 
starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.  
The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.  
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, 
small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.

The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles 
directly into their path.  As the asteroid continues on its way, it 
leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep 
space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in 
hysterics.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, this is suicide!

Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful 
Wookiee, pointing.

				HAN
		There.  That looks pretty good.

				LEIA
		What looks pretty good?

				HAN
		Yeah.  That'll do nicely.

				THREEPIO
			(to Leia)
		Excuse me, ma'am, but where are 
		we going?

Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of 
the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LEIA
		I hope you know what you're doing.

				HAN
		Yeah, me too.

INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Falcon races down into the crater.  The walls are barely visible as 
the ship speed through the tunnellike opening.  A small cave appears on 
one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into 
it.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.  Artoo, 
riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with 
some anxiety.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the 
computer scope.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.

Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		No, I'm not going to change my 
		mind about this.
			(getting a little nervous)
		I'm not picking up any cities or
		technology.  Massive life-form 
		readings, though.  There's something
		alive down there...

Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe 
		for droids.

EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH -  LUKE'S X-WING

The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-
covered planet.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet.  
He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has 
completely obscured his vision.  An alarm buzzes in the background, 
Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		I know, I know!  All the scopes are 
		dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just 
		hang on, I'm going to start the 
		landing cycle...

The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's 
electronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs 
were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the 
spacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK

The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.  
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out 
of his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which 
is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make 
out are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.

				LUKE
		No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll 
		have a look around.

Artoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses 
his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.

				LUKE
		Artoo?

Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water 
is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  Where are you?

A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is 
heard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts 
running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.

				LUKE
		Artoo!  You be more careful.

The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.

Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and 
turns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward 
shore.

				LUKE
		Artoo - that way!

Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving 
toward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the 
swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The 
droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.

Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into 
the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.

				LUKE
		Artoo!

The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin 
to appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the 
water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of 
soft gray moss.

				LUKE
		Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come 
		on.  You're lucky you don't taste 
		very good.  Anything broken?

Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from 
his round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.

				LUKE
		If you're saying coming here was 
		a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree 
		with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we 
		doing here?  It's like... something 
		out of a dream, or, I don't know.  
		Maybe I'm just going crazy.

As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, 
Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.

EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.

After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising 
sight before him.

Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far 
side of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the 
various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts 
from Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar 
tissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet 
onto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face 
Piett.

				VADER
		Yes, Admiral?

				PIETT
Our ships have sighted the 
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But... 
it has entered an asteroid field 
and we cannot risk...

				VADER
			(interrupting)
		Asteroids do not concern me, 
		Admiral.  I want that ship and 
		not excuses.

				PIETT
		Yes, lord.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.  It is so 
dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.  
Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.

				HAN
		I'm going to shut down everything 
		but the emergency power systems.  

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, 
		but... does that include shutting 
		me down, too?

Chewie barks "yes".  But Han thinks otherwise.

				HAN
		No, I need you to talk to the 
		Falcon, find out what's wrong with 
		the hyperdrive.

Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit 
to go flying.  Chewie howls.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, it's quite possible this 
		asteroid is not entirely stable.

				HAN
		Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're 
		here to tell us these things.  Chewie, 
		take the professor in the back and 
		plug him into the hyperdrive.

				THREEPIO
		Oh!  Sometimes I just don't 
		understand human behavior.  After 
		all, I'm only trying to do my job 
		in the most...

The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he 
move back to the hold.  Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia 
across the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as 
suddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they 
are in each other's arms.

				LEIA
		Let go.

				HAN
		Sshh!

				LEIA
		Let go, please.

Leia flushes, averting her eyes.  She's not exactly fighting to get 
free.  But, of course, Han blows it...

				HAN
		Don't get excited.

The anger rises in Leia.

				LEIA
		Captain, being held by you isn't 
		quite enough to get me excited.

				HAN
		Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't 
		got time for anything else.

Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the 
door.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK

The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking 
swamp.

Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites 
a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power 
cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.

				LUKE
		Ready for some power?  Okay.  
		Let's see now.  Put that in 
		there.  There you go.

The droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of 
processed food and sits before the thermal heater.

				LUKE
			(sighs)
		Now all I have to do is find this 
		Yoda... if he even exists.

Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.

				LUKE
		Still... there's something familiar 
		about this place.  I feel like... 
		I don't know...

				STRANGE VOICE
		Feel like what?

Luke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young 
warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the 
speaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange, 
bluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing 
is dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.

				LUKE
			(looking at the 
			 creature)
		Like we're being watched!

				CREATURE
		Away with your weapon!  I mean 
		you no harm.

After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really 
doesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest.

				CREATURE
		I am wondering, why are you here?

				LUKE
		I'm looking for someone.

				CREATURE
		Looking?  Found someone, you have, 
		I would say, hmmm?

The little creature laughs.

				LUKE
			(Trying to keep from 
			 smiling)
		Right.

				CREATURE
		Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

				LUKE
		I don't think so.  I'm looking 
		for a great warrior.

				CREATURE
		Ahhh!  A great warrior.
			(laughs and shakes 
			 his head)
		Wars not make one great.

With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of 
the cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around.

Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the 
creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his 
disapproval.

Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from 
and takes a bite.

				LUKE
		Put that down.  Hey!  That's my 
		dinner!

The creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.

				CREATURE
		How you get so big, eating food 
		of this kind?

He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of 
Luke's supply cases.

				LUKE
		Listen, friend, we didn't mean to 
		land in that puddle, and if we 
		could get our ship out, we would, 
		but we can't, so why don't you just...

				CREATURE
			(teasing)
		Aww, cannot get your ship out?

The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses 
patience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a 
tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.

				LUKE
		Hey, you could have broken this.
		Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're 
		making a mess.  Hey, give me that!

				CREATURE
			(retreating with 
			 the lamp)
		Mine!  Or I will help you not.

Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing 
closer to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little 
arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by 
the creature.

				LUKE
		I don't want your help.  I want 
		my lamp back.  I'll need it to 
		get out of this slimy mudhole.

				CREATURE
		Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately 
engaged in a tug-of-war over it.

Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."

				CREATURE
		Ah, ah, ah!

				LUKE
		Oh, Artoo, let him have it!

				CREATURE
		Mine!  Mine!

				LUKE
		Artoo!

				CREATURE
		Mine!

The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one 
finger.  Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.

				CREATURE
		Mine!

				LUKE
			(fed up)
		Now will you move along, little 
		fella?  We're got a lot of work 
		to do.

				CREATURE
		No!  No, no!  Stay and help you, 
		I will.
			(laughs)
		Find your friend, hmm?

				LUKE
		I'm not looking for a friend. 
		I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

				CREATURE
		Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You 
		seek Yoda.

				LUKE
		You know him?

				CREATURE
		Mmm.  Take you to him, I will.
			(laughs)
		Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
		Come.  Good food.  Come.

With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.  
Luke stares after him.  All he sees is the faint light from the small 
power lamp moving through the fog.  Luke makes his decision and starts 
after the creature.

				CREATURE
			(in the distance)
		Come, come.

Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.

				LUKE
		Stay here and watch after the 
		camp, Artoo.

Artoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view, 
the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic 
sigh.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA

Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in 
front of him.  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, where is Artoo when I need 
		him?

Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, I don't know where your ship 
		learned to communicate, but it 
		has the most peculiar dialect.  I 
		believe, sir, it says that the 
		power coupling on the negative 
		axis has been polarized.  I'm 
		afraid you'll have to replace it.

				HAN
		Well, of course I'll have to replace 
		it.

He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.

				HAN
		Here!  And Chewie...

Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and 
whines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so 
only he can hear.

				HAN
			(continuing)
		... I think we'd better replace 
		the negative power coupling.

Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts 
to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It 
doesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She 
rebuffs him.

				HAN
		Hey, Your Worship, I'm only 
		trying to help.

				LEIA
			(still struggling)
		Would you please stop calling me 
		that?

Han hears a new tone in her voice.  He watches her pull on the lever.

				HAN
		Sure, Leia.

				LEIA
		Oh, you make it so difficult 
		sometimes.

				HAN
		I do, I really do.  You could be 
		a little nicer, though.
			(he watches her 
			 reaction)
		Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you 
		think I'm all right.

She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.

				LEIA
		Occasionally...
			(a little smile, 
			 haltingly)
		... when you aren't acting like 
		a scoundrel.

				HAN
			(laughs)
		Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like 
		the sound of that.

With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.

				LEIA
		Stop that.

				HAN
		Stop what?

Leia is flushes, confused.

				LEIA
		Stop that!  My hands are dirty.

				HAN
		My hands are dirty, too.  What 
		are you afraid of?

				LEIA
			(looking right 
			 into his eyes)
		Afraid?

Han looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more 
handsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and 
takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He 
draws it toward him.

				HAN
		You're trembling.

				LEIA
		I'm not trembling.

Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and 
emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him... 
very slowly.

				HAN
		You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
		There aren't enough scoundrels in 
		your life.

Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an 
excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.

				LEIA
		I happen to like nice men.

				HAN
		I'm a nice man.

				LEIA
		No, you're not.  You're...

He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though 
he had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed 
like this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she 
regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it 
hard to talk.

Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, sir!  I've isolated the 
		reverse power flux coupling.

Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.

				HAN
		Thank you.  Thank you very much.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.

EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently 
seeking its prey.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge 
window.  Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control 
deck.  Then slowly turns toward the bridge.  Before him are the 
hologram images of twenty battleship commanders.  One of these images, 
the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly.  
Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is 
faded and continually disrupted by static.  It is the image of Captain 
Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the 
Millennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark 
Lord.

				NEEDA
			(in hologram)
		... and that, Lord Vader, was the 
		last time they appeared in any of 
		our scopes.  Considering the amount 
		of damage we've sustained, they 
		must have been destroyed.

				VADER
		No, Captain, they're alive.  I 
		want every ship available to 
		sweep the asteroid field until 
		they are found.

The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to 
Admiral Piett.

				PIETT
Lord Vader.

				VADER
		Yes, Admiral, what is it?

The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.

				PIETT
		The Emperor commands you make 
		contact with him.

				VADER
		Move the ship out of the asteroid 
		field so that we can send a clear 
		transmission.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars 
away from the rest of the fleet.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A strange sound 
enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure.  
He looks up and bows quickly.

A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before 
Vader.  The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the 
cloak worn by Ben Kenobi.  His voice is even deeper and more 
frightening than Vader's.

				VADER
		What is thy bidding, my master?

				EMPEROR
		There is a great disturbance in 
		the Force.

				VADER
		I have felt it.

				EMPEROR
		We have a new enemy - Luke 
		Skywalker.

				VADER
		Yes, my master.

				EMPEROR
		He could destroy us.

				VADER
		He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no 
		longer help him.

				EMPEROR
		The Force is strong with him.  The 
		son of Skywalker must not become a 
		Jedi.

				VADER
		If he could be turned, he would 
		become a powerful ally.

				EMPEROR
		Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great 
		asset.  Can it be done?

				VADER
		He will join us or die, my 
		master.

Vader kneels.  The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord 
of the Sith and fades away.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.  A strange 
baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small 
lagoon.  The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its 
thick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, 
the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of 
the glowing portals.

INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE

Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very 
plain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the 
creature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke, 
whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits 
cross-legged on the floor of the living room.

The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up 
an incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and 
pans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding 
that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes 
back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who 
watches the creature impatiently.

				LUKE
		Look, I'm sure it's delicious.  
		I just don't understand why we 
		can't see Yoda now.

				CREATURE
		Patience!  For the Jedi it is 
		time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.  
		Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down 
near the fire and serves himself from the pot.  Tasting the unfamiliar 
concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.

				LUKE
		How far away is Yoda?  Will it 
		take us long to get there?

				CREATURE
		Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
		Soon you will be with him.
			(tasting food from 
			 the pot)
		Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you 
		become Jedi?  Hm?

				LUKE
		Mostly because of my father, I 
		guess.

				CREATURE
		Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi 
		was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

				LUKE
			(a little angry)
		Oh, come on.  How could you know 
		my father?  You don't even know 
		who I am.
			(fed up)
		Oh, I don't know what I'm doing 
		here.  We're wasting our time.

The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.

				CREATURE
			(irritated)
		I cannot teach him.  The boy has 
		no patience.

Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces.  But there is no 
one there.  The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that 
the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking 
with Ben.

				BEN'S VOICE
		He will learn patience.

				YODA
		Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

				BEN'S VOICE
		Was I any different when you 
		taught me?

				YODA
		Hah.  He is not ready.

				LUKE
		Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I 
		can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm 
		ready.

Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low 
ceiling.

				YODA
		Ready, are you?  What know you 
		of ready?  For eight hundred years 
		have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel 
		will I keep on who is to be trained!
		A Jedi must have the deepest 
		commitment, the most serious mind.
			(to the invisible 
			 Ben, indicating Luke)
		This one a long time have I watched.
		All his life has he looked away...
		to the future, to the horizon.
		Never his mind on where he was.
		Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.  
		Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!  
		A Jedi craves not these things.
			(turning to Luke)
		You are reckless!

Luke looks down.  He knows it is true.

				BEN'S VOICE
		So was I, if you'll remember.

				YODA
		He is too old.  Yes, too old to 
		begin the training.

Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.

				LUKE
		But I've learned so much.

Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge 
eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.  After a 
long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.

				YODA
			(sighs)
		Will he finished what he begins?

				LUKE
		I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

				YODA
			(turns slowly toward 
			 him)
		Oh, you will be.  You will be.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid 
storm.  Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing 
ships.  One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid 
and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the 
control panel.  Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.

She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the 
confusion he has created within her.  Suddenly, something outside the 
cockpit window catches her eye.  The reflection of the panel lights 
obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the 
windscreen.  Leia
moves closer to see what it might be.  Large, yellow eyes flash open 
and stare back at her.  Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her 
heart pounding.  There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in 
an instant the eyes are gone.  The young princess catches her breath, 
jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

The lights go bright for a second then out again.  Threepio and 
Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

				HAN
		I'm not really interested in your 
		opinion, Threepio.

Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into 
place.

				LEIA
			(out of breath)
		There's something out there.

				HAN
		Where?

				LEIA
		Outside, in the cave.

As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull.  Chewie looks 
up and barks anxiously.

				THREEPIO
		There it is.  Listen!  Listen!

				HAN
		I'm going out there.

				LEIA
		Are you crazy?!

				HAN
		I just got this bucket back 
		together.  I'm not going to let 
		something tear it apart.

He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia 
follows.

				LEIA
		Then I'm going with you.

				THREEPIO
		I think it might be better if I 
		stay here and guard the ship.
			(hears another 
			 mysterious noise)
		Oh, no.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is 
attacking the ship.

Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.

				LEIA
		This ground sure feels strange.
		It doesn't feel like rock at all.

Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline 
of the cave.

				HAN
		There's an awful lot of moisture 
		in here.

				LEIA
		I don't know.  I have a bad feeling 
		about this.

				HAN
		Yeah.

Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's 
cockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of 
the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it 
with a laser bolt.

				HAN
			(to Leia)
		Watch out!

The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front 
of the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.

				HAN
		Yeah, that's what I thought.
		Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest 
		of the ship, make sure there 
		aren't any more attached.  They're 
		chewing on the power cables.

				LEIA
		Mynocks?

				HAN
		Go on inside.  We'll clean them 
		off if there are any more.

Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia 
puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the 
ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of 
the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit 
window of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.

				THREEPIO
		Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly 
		little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.

				HAN
		Wait a minute...

He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.  
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.

Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.  
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their 
faces and run up the platform.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA

As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch.  
The ship continues to shake and heave.

				HAN
		All right, Chewie, let's get 
		out of here!

The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes 
to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia 
hurries after.

				LEIA
		The Empire is still out there.
		I don't think it's wise to...

Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

				HAN
			(interrupting)
		No time to discuss this in
		committee.

And with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to 
whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.

				LEIA
			(angry)
		I am not a committee!

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle.  The 
cave-quake has greatly diminished.

				LEIA
		You can't make the jump to light-
		speed in this asteroid field...

				HAN
		Sit down, sweetheart.  We're 
		taking off!

As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something 
out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.

				THREEPIO
		Look!

				HAN
		I see it, I see it.

Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen 
surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the 
entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the 
throttle, sending his ship surging forward.

				THREEPIO
		We're doomed!

				LEIA
		The cave is collapsing.

				HAN
		This is no cave.

				LEIA
		What?

Leia's mouth drops open .  She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance 
are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny 
ship.  Chewie howls.

INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH

The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on 
its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth 
before the huge jaws slams closed.

EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID

The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon 
flies out of its mouth.  The monster tilts its head, watching the 
starship fly away.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID

The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of 
the asteroid storm.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DAY

With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick 
vines that grow in the swamp.  Panting heavily, he continues his course 
- climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in 
and out of the heavy ground fog.

				YODA
		Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength 
		flows from the Force.  But beware 
		of the dark side.  Anger... fear... 
		aggression.  The dark side of 
		the Force are they.
		Easily they flow, quick to join 
		you in a fight.  If once you 
		start down the dark path, forever 
		will it dominate your destiny, 
		consume you it will, as it did 
		Obi-Wan's apprentice.

				LUKE
		Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?

				YODA
		No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, 
		more seductive.

				LUKE
		But how am I to know the good side 
		from the bad?

				YODA
		You will know.  When you are calm, 
		at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses 
		the Force for knowledge and 
		defense, never for attack.

				LUKE
		But tell me why I can't...

				YODA
			(interrupting)
		No, no, there is no why.  Nothing 
		more will I teach you today.
		Clear your mind of questions.  
		Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.  
Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and 
pulls it on.

He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few 
feet of water.  Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on 
one side.  Luke stares at the tree, trembling.

				LUKE
		There's something not right here.

Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.

				LUKE
		I feel cold, death.

				YODA
		That place... is strong with the 
		dark side of the Force.  A domain 
		of evil it is.  In you must go.

				LUKE
		What's in there?

				YODA
		Only what you take with you.

Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.  He starts to strap on his 
weapon belt.

				YODA
		Your weapons... you will not 
		need them.

Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no."  Yoda 
shrugs.  Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters 
the tree.

INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE

Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave.  
The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage.  Holding his lit 
saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and 
a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree.  Luke draws a deep 
breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.

The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.  
His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.  It is 
very quiet here.

Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness, 
illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately, he 
charges Luke, saber held high.  He is upon the youth in seconds, but 
Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.

Vader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders 
as his body disappears into the darkness.  The metallic banging of the 
helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the 
floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it 
cracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to 
reveal... Luke's head.

Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in 
terror.

The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK

Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.

EXT. SPACE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its 
convoy of TIE fighters.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK

Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a 
motley group of men and creatures.  Admiral Piett and two controllers 
stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.

				PIETT
		Bounty hunters.  We don't need 
		that scum.

				FIRST CONTROLLER
		Yes, sir.

				PIETT
		Those Rebels won't escape us.

A second controller interrupts.

				SECOND CONTROLLER
		Sir, we have a priority signal 
		from the Star Destroyer Avenger.

				PIETT
		Right.

The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune 
hunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge, 
bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-
scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war 
droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.

				VADER
		... there will be a substantial 
		reward for the one who finds the 
		Millennium Falcon.  You are free 
		to use any methods necessary, but 
		I want them alive.  No disintegrations.

				BOBA FETT
		As you wish.

At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.

				PIETT
		Lord Vader!  My lord, we have 
		them.

EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a 
firing Imperial Star Destroyer.  A large asteroid about the same size 
as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.  The tiny Falcon 
banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.  
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly 
on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.  Threepio 
checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches 
tensely out the window.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, thank goodness we're coming 
		out of the asteroid field.

Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A 
bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side 
of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which 
creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.  The 
Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han corrects the angle of his ship.

				HAN
		Let's get out of here.  Ready for 
		light-speed?  One... two... three!

Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak 
bursts continue to rock the ship.

				HAN
			(frantic)
		It's not fair!

Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and 
captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.

				HAN
		The transfer circuits are working.
		It's not my fault!

Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.

				LEIA
			(almost expecting 
			 it)
		No light-speed?

				HAN
		It's not my fault.

				THREEPIO
		Sir, we just lost the main rear 
		deflector shield.  One more direct 
		hit on the back quarter and we're 
		done for.

Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.

				HAN
		Turn her around.

Chewie barks in puzzlement.

				HAN
		I said turn her around!  I'm 
		going to put all power in the 
		front shield.

				LEIA
		You're going to attack them?!

				THREEPIO
		Sir, the odds of surviving a 
		direct assault on an Imperial 
		Star Destroyer...

				LEIA
		Shut up!

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.  In the next moment it 
is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the 
massive surface of the Imperial ship.  As it moves across the surface 
of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous 
flak bursts.

INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE

The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.  The Imperials 
stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low 
across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge 
area.  Alarms go off everywhere.  The Destroyer's commander, Captain 
Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.

				NEEDA
		They're moving to attack 
		position!  Shields up!

Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window.  At the 
last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight.  All is quiet.

				NEEDA
		Track them.  They may come 
		around for another pass.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		Captain Needa, the ship no longer 
		appears on our scopes.

				NEEDA
		They can't have disappeared.  No 
		ship that small has a cloaking 
		device.

				TRACKING OFFICER
		Well, there's no trace of them, 
		sir.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		Captain, Lord Vader demands an 
		update on the pursuit.

				NEEDA
			(drawing a breath)
		Get a shuttle ready.  I shall 
		assume full responsibility for 
		losing them, and apologize to Lord 
		Vader. Meanwhile, continue to 
		scan the area.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		Yes, Captain Needa.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY

Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain.  He stands on 
his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.  Opposite Luke and Yoda are 
two rocks the size of bowling balls.  Luke stares at the rocks and 
concentrates.  One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to 
rest on the other.

				YODA
		Use the Force.  Yes...

Yoda taps Luke's leg.  Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.  
His body wavers, but he maintains his balance.  Artoo, standing nearby, 
is whistling and beeping frantically.

				YODA
		Now... the stone.  Feel it.

Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock.  It rises a few feet, 
shaking under the strain.  But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping, 
Luke loses his balance and finally collapses.  Yoda jumps clear.

				YODA
		Concentrate!

Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking 
urgently back and forth in front of him.

Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the 
edge of the swamp.  Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge.  The 
X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the 
lake's surface.

				LUKE
		Oh, no.  We'll never get it out 
		now.

Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.

				YODA
		So certain are you.  Always with 
		you it cannot be done.  Hear you
		nothing that I say?

Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.

				LUKE
		Master, moving stones around is 
		one thing.  This is totally 
		different.

				YODA
		No!  No different!  Only different 
		in your mind.  You must unlearn 
		what you have learned.

				LUKE
			(focusing, quietly)
		All right, I'll give it a try.

				YODA
		No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.  
		There is no try.

Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.

Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.  It hovers 
for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.

				LUKE
			(panting heavily)
		I can't.  It's too big.

				YODA
		Size matters not.  Look at me.  
		Judge me by my size, do you?  
		Hm?  Mmmm.

Luke shakes his head.

				YODA
		And well you should not.  For my 
		ally in the Force.  And a powerful 
		ally it is.  Life creates it, makes 
		it grow.  Its energy surrounds us 
		and binds us.  Luminous beings 
		are we...
			(Yoda pinches 
			 Luke's shoulder)
		... not this crude matter.
			(a sweeping gesture)
		You must feel the Force around you.
			(gesturing)
		Here, between you... me... the 
		tree... the rock... everywhere!  
		Yes, even between this land and 
		that ship!

				LUKE
			(discouraged)
		You want the impossible.

Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and 
his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.

Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo 
beeps in terror and scoots away.

The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore.  Yoda 
stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the 
beach.

Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.  
He walks toward Yoda.

				LUKE
		I don't... I don't believe it.

				YODA
		That is why you fail.

Luke shakes his head, bewildered.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star 
Destroyer, the Avenger.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then 
falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader.  Two stormtroopers 
pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett 
and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.

				PIETT
		Lord Vader, our ships have 
		completed their scan of the area 
		and found nothing.  If the 
		Millennium Falcon went into light-
		speed, it'll be on the other side 
		of the galaxy by now.

				VADER
		Alert all commands.  Calculate 
		every possible destination along 
		their last know trajectory.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.  We'll find them.

				VADER
		Don't fail me again, Admiral.

Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than 
when he arrived.

				PIETT
		Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.  the 
Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.  No one on 
that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the 
Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				THREEPIO
		Captain Solo, this time you have 
		gone too far.
			(Chewie growls)
		No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
		Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		The fleet is beginning to break 
		up.  Go back and stand by the 
		manual release for the landing claw.

Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.

				THREEPIO
		I really don't see how that is 
		going to help.  Surrender is a 
		perfectly acceptable alternative 
		in extreme circumstances.  The 
		Empire may be gracious enough...

Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.

				HAN
		Thank you.

				LEIA
		What did you have in mind for 
		your next move?

				HAN
		Well, if they follow standard 
		Imperial procedure, they'll dump 
		their garbage before they go to 
		light-speed, then we just float 
		away.

				LEIA
		With the rest of the garbage.
		Then what?

				HAN
		Then we've got to find a safe 
		port somewhere around here.  Got 
		any ideas?

				LEIA
		No.  Where are we?

				HAN
		The Anoat system.

				LEIA
		Anoat system.  There's not much 
		there.

				HAN
		No.  Well, wait.  This is 
		interesting.  Lando.

He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out 
of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points 
representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.

				LEIA
		Lando system?

				HAN
		Lando's not a system, he's a man.
		Lando Calrissian.  He's a card 
		player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd 
		like him.

				LEIA
		Thanks.

				HAN
		Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I 
		think we can make it.

				LEIA
			(reading from the 
			 computer)
		A mining colony?

				HAN
		Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando 
		conned somebody out of it.  We 
		go back a long way, Lando and me.

				LEIA
		Can you trust him?

				HAN
		No.  But he has no love for the
		Empire, I can tell you that.

Chewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and 
stretches to look out the cockpit window.

				HAN
			(into intercom)
		Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
		Detach!

Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She 
thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and 
she gives him a quick kiss.

				LEIA
		You do have your moments.  Not 
		many, but you have them.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its 
underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.  Hidden among the 
refuse, the Falcon tumbles away.  In the next moment, the Avenger roars 
off into hyperspace.  The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races 
off into the distance.  Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's 
ship appears and moves after the Falcon.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY

In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but 
his face shows less strain and more concentration than before.  Yoda 
sits on the ground below the young warrior.  On the other side of the 
clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.  Nearby Artoo 
watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.  
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, 
looking for help.

				YODA
		Concentrate... feel the Force 
		flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.  
		Through the Force, things you 
		will see.  Other places.  The 
		future... the past.  Old friends 
		long gone.

Luke suddenly becomes distressed.

				LUKE
		Han!  Leia!

The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then 
Luke himself tumbles over.

				YODA
			(shaking his head)
		Hmm.  Control, control.  You must 
		learn control.

				LUKE
		I saw... I saw a city in the 
		clouds.

				YODA
		Mmm.  Friends you have there.

				LUKE
		They were in pain.

				YODA
It is the future you see.

				LUKE
		Future?  Will they die?

Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.

				YODA
		Difficult to see.  Always in 
		motion is the future.

				LUKE
		I've got to go to them.

				YODA
		Decide you must how to serve 
		them best.  If you leave now, 
		help them you could.  But you 
		would destroy all for which they 
		have fought and suffered.

Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words.  Gloom shrouds him as he nods his 
head sadly.

EXT. BESPIN SYSTEM - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAWN

The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward 
the soft pink planet of Bespin.

EXT. BESPIN SURFACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is down on the gaseous planet.  Huge billowing clouds form a canyon 
as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City.

Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon.  
The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

One of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the 
ship.  Chewie barks his concern.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		No, I don't have a landing 
		permit.  I'm trying to reach 
		Lando Calrissian.

More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's 
interior.  Leia looks worried.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me 
		explain.

				INTERCOM VOICE
		You will not deviate from your 
		present course.

				THREEPIO
		Rather touchy, aren't they?

				LEIA
		I thought you knew this person.

Chewie barks and growls at his boss.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Well, that was a long time ago.
		I'm sure he's forgotten about 
		that.

				INTERCOM VOICE
		Permission granted to land on 
		Platform Three-two-seven.

				HAN
			(into transmitter)
		Thank you.

Angry, Han snaps off the intercom.  Chewie looks at him and grunts.  
Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.

				HAN
		There's nothing to worry about.
		We go way back, Lando and me.

Leia doesn't look convinced.

				LEIA
		Who's worried?

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CARS

The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out 
of the cloud surface.  The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the 
gleaming white metropolis.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - MILLENNIUM FALCON

With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the 
Cloud City's platforms.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed.  Behind them, Chewie, also 
armed, surveys the scene warily.

				THREEPIO
		Oh.  No one to meet us.

				LEIA
		I don't like this.

				HAN
		Well, what would you like?

				THREEPIO
		Well, they did let us land.

				HAN
		Look, don't worry.  Everything's 
		going to be fine.  Trust me.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a 
group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing 
platform.

The group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection 
of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions.  Lando has a grim 
expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

				HAN
		See?  My friend.
			(to Chewie)
		Keep your eyes open, okay?

Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.  Lando and his men head 
across the bridge to meet the space pirate.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Lando stops ten feet from Han.  The two men eye each other carefully.  
Lando shakes his head.

				LANDO
		Why, you slimy, double-crossing, 
		no-good swindler!  You've got a 
		lot of guts coming here, after 
		what you pulled.

Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"

Lando moves threateningly toward Han.  Suddenly, he throws his arms 
around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.

				LANDO
			(laughs)
		How you doing, you old pirate? 
		So good to see you!  I never thought 
		I'd catch up with you again.  Where 
		you been?

The two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON.

				THREEPIO
Well, he seems very friendly.

				LEIA
			(wary)
		Yes... very friendly.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

				LANDO
		What are you doing here?

				HAN
			(gestures toward 
			 the Falcon)
		Ahh... repairs.  I thought you 
		could help me out.

				LANDO
			(in mock panic)
		What have you done to my ship?

				HAN
		Your ship?  Hey, remember, you 
		lost her to me fair and square.

Chewie growls a reserved greeting.  Lando suddenly notices the princess 
and smiles.

				LANDO
		Hello.  What have we here?  
		Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
		I'm the administrator of this 
		facility.  And who might you be?

				LEIA
		Leia.

				LANDO
		Welcome, Leia.

Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.

				HAN
		All right, all right, you old 
		smoothie.

Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.

				THREEPIO
		Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio, 
		human-cyborg relations.  My 
		facilities are at your...

Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to 
follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.

				THREEPIO
		Well, really!

Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge, 
followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.

				LANDO
		What's wrong with the Falcon?

				HAN
		Hyperdrive.

				LANDO
		I'll get my people to work on it.

				HAN
		Good.

Lando turns to Leia.

				LANDO
		You know, that ship saved my life 
		quite a few times.  She's the 
		fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city.  They 
walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and 
passing many small plazas as they go.  Threepio lags a bit behind.

				HAN
		How's the gas mine?  Is it 
		paying off for you?

				LANDO
		Oh, not as well as I'd like.
		We're a small outpost and not 
		very self-sufficient.  And I've 
		had supply problems of every kind.
		I've had labor difficulties...
			(catches Han 
			 grinning at him)
		What's so funny?

				HAN
		You.  Listen to you - you sound 
		like a businessman, a responsible 
		leader.  Who'd have thought that, 
		huh?

Lando is reflective.  He looks at Han a moment.

				LANDO
		You know, seeing you sure 
		brings back a few things.

				HAN
		Yeah.

				LANDO
			(shakes his head)
		Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
		It's the price you pay for being 
		successful.

Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the 
corridor.

The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming 
out of a door.

				THREEPIO
		Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

				SECOND THREEPIO
			(mumbles)
		E chu ta!

				THREEPIO
		How rude!

Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away.  Then he hears the 
muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the 
room.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Curious, Threepio enters the room.

				THREEPIO
		That sounds like an R2 unit in 
		there.  I wonder if...

Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room.  He looks in.

				THREEPIO
		Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

				MAN'S VOICE
			(from within)
		Who are you?

				THREEPIO
		Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I 
		didn't mean to intrude.  No, no, 
		please don't get up.  No!

A laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions.  
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door 
whooshes closed behind him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's 
dreadful accident.  Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but 
shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK

In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the 
belly of the ship.  Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into 
his cubbyhole.  Yoda stands nearby on a log.

				YODA
		Luke!  You must complete the 
		training.

				LUKE
		I can't keep the vision out of my 
		head.  They're my friends.  I've 
		got to help them.

				YODA
		You must not go!

				LUKE
		But Han and Leia will die if I 
		don't.

				BEN'S VOICE
		You don't know that.

Luke looks toward the voice in amazement.  Ben has materialized as a 
real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.  The power of his presence 
stops Luke.

				BEN
		Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

				LUKE
		But I can help them!  I feel 
		the Force!

				BEN
		But you cannot control it.  This 
		is a dangerous time for you, 
		when you will be tempted by the 
		dark side of the Force.

				YODA
		Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
		The cave.  Remember your failure 
		at the cave!

				LUKE
		But I've learned so much since 
		then.  Master Yoda, I promise to 
		return and finish what I've begun. 
		You have my word.

				BEN
		It is you and your abilities the 
		Emperor wants.  that is why your 
		friends are made to suffer.

				LUKE
		And that is why I have to go.

				BEN
		Luke, I don't want to lose you to 
		the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

				LUKE
		You won't.

				YODA
		Stopped they must be.  On this 
		all depends.  Only a fully trained 
		Jedi Knight with the Force as his 
		ally will conquer Vader and his 
		Emperor.  If you end your training 
		now, if you choose the quick and 
		easy path, as Vader did, you will 
		become an agent of evil.

				BEN
		Patience.

				LUKE
		And sacrifice Han and Leia?

				YODA
		If you honor what they fight for
		... yes!

Luke is in great anguish.  He struggles with the dilemma, a battle 
raging in his mind.

				BEN
		If you choose to face Vader, you 
		will do it alone.  I cannot 
		interfere.

				LUKE
		I understand.
			(he moves to his 
			 X-wing)
		Artoo, fire up the converters.

Artoo whistles a happy reply.

				BEN
		Luke, don't give in to hate - 
		that leads to the dark side.

Luke nods and climbs into his ship.

				YODA
		Strong is Vader.  Mind what you 
		have learned.  Save you it can.

				LUKE
		I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

Artoo closes the cockpit.  Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of 
the engines and the wind engulf them.

				YODA
			(sighs)
		Told you, I did.  Reckless is 
		he.  Now matters are worse.

				BEN
		That boy is our last hope.

				YODA
			(looks up)
		No.  There is another.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET DAGOBAH

Luke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and 
off into space.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in 
agitation.  She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a 
lovely dress.  Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons.  She moves 
from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the 
doorway.

				HAN
		The ship is almost finished.
		Two or Three more things and 
		we're in great shape.

				LEIA
		The sooner the better.  Something's 
		wrong here.  No one has seen or 
		knows anything about Threepio.
		He's been gone too long to have 
		gotten lost.

Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.

				HAN
		Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and 
		see what I can find out.

				LEIA
		I don't trust Lando.

				HAN
		Well, I don't trust him, either.
		But he is my friend.  Besides, 
		we'll soon be gone.

				LEIA
		And then you're as good as gone, 
		aren't you?

Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.

INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM

The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four 
Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some 
pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten 
metal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie 
enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting 
Threepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, 
then reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from 
him to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until 
Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the 
ground.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

The door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of 
Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.

				LEIA
		What happened?

Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.

				HAN
		Where?  Found him in a junk pile?

				LEIA
		Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you 
		think you can repair him?

The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts.  He looks at the 
princess and shrugs sadly.

				HAN
		Lando's got people who can fix 
		him.

				LEIA
		No, thanks.

There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.

				LANDO
		I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting 
		anything?

				LEIA
		Not really.

				LANDO
		You look absolutely beautiful.
		You truly belong here with us 
		among the clouds.

				LEIA
			(coolly)
		Thank you.

				LANDO
		Will you join me for a little 
		refreshment?

Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of 
food and licks his lips.

				LANDO
		Everyone's invited, of course.

Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go.  Lando 
spots Threepio's remains.

				LANDO
		Having trouble with you droid?

Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.

				HAN
		No.  No problem.  Why?

Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and 
Chewie.  The door slides closed behind them.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance 
behind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall, 
pure-white columns.

				LANDO
		So you see, since we're a small 
		operation, we don't fall into 
		the... uh... jurisdiction of the 
		Empire.

				LEIA
		So you're part of the mining 
		guild then?

				LANDO
		No, not actually.  Our operation 
		is small enough not to be noticed... 
		which is advantageous for everybody 
		since our customers are anxious 
		to avoid attracting attention to 
		themselves.

The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at 
the far end.

				HAN
		Aren't you afraid the Empire's 
		going to find out about this 
		little operation and shut you down?

				LANDO
		That's always been a danger looming 
		like a shadow over everything we've 
		built here.  But things have 
		developed that will insure security.
		I've just made a deal that will 
		keep the Empire out of here forever.

INT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM

The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the 
dining room.  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.  
Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty 
hunter.

Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a 
couple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his 
hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they 
explode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's 
hand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of 
him.

				VADER
		We would be honored if you would 
		join us.

Han gives Lando a mean look.

				LANDO
		I had no choice.  They arrived 
right before you did.  I'm sorry.
		
				HAN
		I'm sorry, too.

EXT.  LUKE'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM

Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's shining 
city.  Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		No, Threepio's with them.

Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Just hang on.  We're almost there.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell.  The stark room is flooded 
with hot light.  To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle 
screeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant 
fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper 
lights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a 
wall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he 
moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He 
picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, 
barking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on 
its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.

Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches 
two connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his 
voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.

				THREEPIO
		Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take 
		this off!  I, uh, don't mean to 
		intrude here.  I, don't, no, no, 
		no... Please don't get up.  No!

Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry 
head.  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio 
immediately begins speaking normally.

				THREEPIO
		Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in 
		danger.  I must tell the others.
		Oh, no!  I've been shot!

INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA

Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an 
elaborate torture mechanism.  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts 
forward onto the torture device.  Vader activates the mechanism, 
creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.

The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a 
sharp, piercing cry of agony.  Darth Vader moves to the holding 
chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER

				LANDO
		Lord Vader.

				VADER
			(to Fett)
		You may take Captain Solo to 
		Jabba the Hut after I have 
		Skywalker.

Han's screams filter through the torture room door.

				BOBA FETT
		He's no good to me dead.

				VADER
		He will not be permanently damaged.

				LANDO
		Lord Vader, what about Leia and 
		the Wookiee?

				VADER
		They must never again leave this 
		city.

				LANDO
		That was never a condition of our 
		agreement, nor was giving Han to 
		this bounty hunter!

				VADER
		Perhaps you think you're being 
		treated unfairly.

				LANDO
		No.

				VADER
		Good.  It would be unfortunate if 
		I had to leave a garrison here.

Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.  Lando walks 
swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.

				LANDO
		This deal's getting worse all 
		the time.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.  One arm is 
connected, but the legs are yet to be attached.  There is one small 
problem, however.  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's 
head on backwards.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like 
		that.  Oh!  Something's not right 
		because now I can't see.  Wait.  
		Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?  
		I'm backwards, you stupid furball.  
		Only an overgrown mophead like you 
		would be stupid enough...

Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a 
circuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and 
sits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is 
shoved into the room by two stormtroopers.  Barking his concern, the 
huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug.  Han is very pale, with dark circles 
under his eyes.

				HAN
		I feel terrible.

Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open 
revealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers 
push her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han, 
who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking 
his head.

				LEIA
		Why are they doing this?

				HAN
		They never even asked me any 
		questions.

The cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.

				LEIA
		Lando.

				HAN
		Get out of here, Lando!

				LANDO
		Shut up and listen!  Vader has 
		agreed to turn Leia and Chewie 
		over to me.

				HAN
		Over to you?

				LANDO
		They'll have to stay here, but at 
		least they'll be safe.

				LEIA
		What about Han?

				LANDO
		Vader's giving him to the bounty 
		hunter.

				LEIA
		Vader wants us all dead.

				LANDO
		He doesn't want you at all.  He's 
		after somebody called Skywalker.

				HAN
		Luke?

				LANDO
		Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

Leia's mind is racing.

				LEIA
		And we're the bait.

				LANDO
		Well, he's on his way.

Han's rage peaks.

				HAN
		Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty 
		good, didn't you?
			(spits it out)
		My friend!

Han hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged 
in a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle 
butts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the 
guards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando 
stops them.

				LANDO
		Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm 
		sorry I couldn't do better, but 
		I have my own problems.

				HAN
		Yeah, you're a real hero.

Lando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia 
and Chewie help him up.

				LEIA
			(dabs at his wound)
		You certainly have a way with 
		people.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large 
chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle 
of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader 
and Lando stand near the platform.

				VADER
		This facility is crude, but it 
		should be adequate to freeze 
		Skywalker for his journey to the 
		Emperor.

An Imperial soldier appears.

				IMPERIAL SOLDIER
		Lord Vader, ship approaching.
		X-wing class.

				VADER
		Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow 
		him to land.

The soldier bows and leaves the chamber.

				LANDO
		Lord Vader, we only use this 
		facility for carbon freezing.  If 
		you put him in there, it might 
		kill him.

				VADER
		I do not want the Emperor's prize 
		damaged.  We will test it... on 
		Captain Solo.

Lando's face registers dismay.

EXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six 
Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special 
coffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a 
squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to 
Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is 
Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's 
and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see 
what is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive, 
intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The 
remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back 
so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.

				THREEPIO
		If only you had attached my legs, 
		I wouldn't be in this ridiculous 
		position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, 
		you have a responsibility to me, 
		so don't do anything foolish.

				HAN
			(to Lando)
		What's going on... buddy?

				LANDO
		You're being put into carbon freeze.

Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.

				BOBA FETT
		What if he doesn't survive?  He's 
		worth a lot to me.

				VADER
		The Empire will compensate you 
		if he dies.  Put him in!

Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and 
attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other 
Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee 
with their laser weapons.

From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in 
panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, 
		Chewbacca, stop...!

The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.

				HAN
		Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear 
		me?  Stop!

				THREEPIO
		Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready 
		to die.

Han breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him 
go and the pirate breaks up the fight.

				HAN
		Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help 
		me.  Hey!

Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.

				HAN
		Save your strength.  There'll be 
		another time.  The princess - you 
		have to take care of her.  You 
		hear me?

Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.

In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too 
distraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look 
sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a 
final, passionate kiss.

				LEIA
		I love you!

				HAN
		I know.

Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to 
the hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and 
then, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in 
agony.

Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.

Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and 
fluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns 
away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.

				THREEPIO
		What... what's going on?  Turn 
		round, Chewbacca, I can't see.  
		Oh... they've encased him in 
		carbonite.  He should be quite 
		well-protected - if he survives 
		the freezing process, that is.

Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an 
angry glance and bark.

A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate 
out of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush 
over and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the 
coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it 
inside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step 
away.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He 
shakes his head in relief.

				VADER
		Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

				LANDO
		Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect 
		hibernation.

Vader turns to Boba Fett.

				VADER
		He's all yours bounty hunter.
		Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

				IMPERIAL OFFICER
		Skywalker has just landed, my 
		lord.

				VADER
		Good.  See to it that he finds 
		his way here.  Calrissian, take 
		the princess and the Wookiee to 
		my ship.

				LANDO
		You said they'd be left in the 
		city under my supervision.

				VADER
		I am altering the deal.  Pray I 
		don't alter it any further.

Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia, 
Chewie, and Threepio.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a 
group of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited 
series of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops 
in his tracks with a feeble squeak.

Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the 
floating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow, 
immediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon 
and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The 
two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and 
fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a 
huge chunk of wall.

Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett, 
Han, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.  
Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a 
second hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time 
to see Luke.

				LEIA
		Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a 
		trap!  It's a trap!

Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears 
from sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing 
behind.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the 
others are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the 
corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes 
slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut, 
echoing through the chamber.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM

Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He 
whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the 
other direction.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM

Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an 
opening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he 
stands on begins to move.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is 
deathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else 
seems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.

Steam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam, 
Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters 
his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident, 
eager to engage his enemy.

				VADER
		The Force is with you, young 
		Skywalker.  But you are not a 
		Jedi yet.

Luke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is 
lit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and 
the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along, 
guarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where 
Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.

The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.  
Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia 
and one to Lando.

				LANDO
		Well done.  Hold them in the 
		security tower - and keep it 
		quiet.  Move.

As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to 
undo Chewie's binding.

				LEIA
		What do you think you're doing?

				LANDO
		We're getting out of here.

				THREEPIO
		I knew all along it had to be a 
		mistake.

Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.

				LEIA
		Do you think that after what you 
		did to Han we're going to trust 
		you?

Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.

				LANDO
			(choking)
		I had no choice...

Chewie barks ferociously.

				THREEPIO
			(to Chewie)
		What are you doing?  Trust him, 
		trust him!

				LEIA
		Oh, so we understand, don't we, 
		Chewie?  He had no choice.

				LANDO
		I'm just trying to help...

				LEIA
		We don't need any of your help.

				LANDO
			(choking)
		H-a-a-a...

				LEIA
		What?

				THREEPIO
		It sounds like Han.

				LANDO
		There's still a chance to save 
		Han... I mean, at the East 
		Platform...

				LEIA
		Chewie.

Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.

				THREEPIO
			(to Lando)
		I'm terribly sorry about all this. 
		After all, he's only a Wookiee.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP

The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of 
the bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to 
the cargo hold.

				BOBA FETT
		Put Captain Solo in the cargo 
		hold.

And with that, the door slams shut.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly 
they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you 
		been?

Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be 
spun out of sight of his friend.

				THREEPIO
		Turn around, you wooly...! 
			(to Artoo)
		Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to 
		save Han from the bounty hunter!

Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing 
group.

				THREEPIO
		Well, at least your still in 
		one piece!  Look what happened to 
		me!

EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY

An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a 
large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.

Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset 
sky.  

In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind 
		you!

A laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what 
Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad 
of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the 
elevator.

Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break 
for the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess 
and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out 
of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely 
notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of 
captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.

But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser 
fire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut 
and the stormtroopers race forward.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the 
chamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively 
drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.

				VADER
		You have learned much, young one.

				LUKE
		You'll find I'm full of surprises.

Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and 
sending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the 
youth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls 
down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he 
sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up 
to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls 
away as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his 
enemy.

				VADER
		Your destiny lies with me, 
		Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to 
		be true.

				LUKE
		No!

Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All 
the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.

Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and 
falls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant 
freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and 
deactivates his sword.

				VADER
		All to easy.  Perhaps you are not 
		as strong as the Emperor thought.

Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal 
begins to pour into the pit.

Vader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped 
fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the 
carbonite outlet.

				VADER
		Impressive... most impressive.

Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the 
steaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had 
fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his 
outstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights 
his sword as well.

				VADER
		Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You 
		have controlled your fear... now 
		release your anger.

Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as 
Vader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he 
has been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.  
Another exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.

				VADER
		Only your hatred can destroy me.

Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.  
He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to 
fill up with steam.

Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword, 
but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The 
energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of 
collapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of 
Vader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers 
himself into the pit.

INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM

Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the 
reactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward 
a large window as Vader enters.

Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.

Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall 
and comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in 
half just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force, 
Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an 
invisible shield.

A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.  
Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.  
Small tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all 
sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is 
bloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes 
flying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room, 
unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.

A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his 
deactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to 
scramble up.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM

Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the 
door to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a 
moment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as 
stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a 
rain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando 
punches desperately at the door's control panel.

				LANDO
		The security codes has been changed!

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, you can tell the computer 
		to override the security system.

Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps 
and scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's 
intercom.

				LANDO
		Attention!  This is Lando
		Calrissian.  The Empire has takes 
		control of the city.  I advise 
		everyone to leave before more 
		Imperial troops arrive.

Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the 
socket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's 
circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out 
underneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.

				LANDO
		This way.

Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots 
along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.

				THREEPIO
		Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. 
		I'm not supposed to know a power 
		socket from a computer terminal.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.  
Some carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction.  
Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.

Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back 
at them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while 
Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.

				THREEPIO
		What are you talking about?  We're 
		not interested in the hyperdrive 
		on the Millennium Falcon.  It's 
		fixed!  Just open the door, you 
		stupid lump.

Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep 
from Artoo - and the door snaps open.

				THREEPIO
			(to Artoo)
		I never doubted you for a second.
		Wonderful!

Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes 
outside.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK

They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers 
reaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the 
droids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the 
Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.

				THREEPIO
		Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend 
		down, you thoughtless... Ow!

Chewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando 
and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.

				LANDO
		Leia!  Go!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR

Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the 
Falcon.

				THREEPIO
		I thought that hairy beast would 
		be the end of me.  Of course, I've 
		looked better.

Artoo beeps understandingly.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches 
over their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship 
begins to move.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK

The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars 
away from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in 
pursuit.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.

Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet 
Vader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke 
backward toward the gantry.

				VADER
		You are beaten.  It is useless 
		to resist.  Don't let yourself 
		be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so 
viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks 
and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.

Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at 
him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick 
move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.  
Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins 
to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.

Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant, 
Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his 
hand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his 
forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its 
extreme end.  Vader
follows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to 
go.  

				VADER
		There is no escape.  Don't make 
		me destroy you.  You do not yet 
		realize your importance.  You 
		have only begun to discover your 
		power.  Join me and I will complete 
		your training.  With our combined 
		strength, we can end this destructive 
		conflict and bring order to the 
		galaxy.

				LUKE
		I'll never join you!

				VADER
		If you only knew the power of the 
		dark side.  Obi-Wan never told 
		you what happened to your father.

				LUKE
		He told me enough!  It was you 
		who killed him.

				VADER
		No.  I am your father.

Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.

				LUKE
		No.  No.  That's not true!  
		That's impossible!

				VADER
		Search your feelings.  You know 
		it to be true.

				LUKE
		No!  No!  No!

				VADER
		Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
		He has foreseen this.  It is your 
		destiny.  Join me, and together 
		we can rule the galaxy as father 
		and son.  Come with me.  It is the 
		only way.

Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.

A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant 
he steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over 
the platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow 
at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the 
edge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, 
unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.

INT. REACTOR SHAFT

Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.  
When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.

INT. EXHAUST PIPE

Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.

He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet 
hit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of 
the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK

Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the 
undermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to 
grab onto on electronic weather vane.

				LUKE
		Ben... Ben, please!

Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.  
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the 
while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust 
pipe.

				LUKE
		Ben.  Leia!

There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.

				LUKE
		Hear me!  Leia!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is 
busy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a 
readout on the control panel.

				LEIA
		Luke... We've got to go back.

Chewie growls in surprise.

				LANDO
		What?

				LEIA
		I know where Luke is.

				LANDO
		But what about those fighter?

Chewie barks in agreement with Lando.

				LEIA
		Chewie, just do it.

				LANDO
		But what about Vader?

Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

				LANDO
		All right, all right, all right.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK

The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the 
Falcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.

He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing 
platform.

				VADER
		Bring my shuttle.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his 
body shifts in the wind.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.  Three TIE 
fighter close in on the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Leia tries to remain calm.

				LANDO
			(pointing out the 
			 cockpit window)
		Look, someone's up there.

				LEIA
		It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
		Slow down and we'll get under him.
		Lando, open the top hatch.

Lando rushes out of the cockpit.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips 
from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks 
toward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up 
through the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally 
falls from the vane into space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the 
city.  The ship gains on him.

				LEIA
		Okay.  Easy, Chewie.

The Falcon closes in on Luke.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH

The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure.  Lando reaches out to help 
the battered warrior inside the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Flak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city.  Leia 
and Chewie struggle with the controls.

				LEIA
			(into intercom)
		Lando?

				LANDO
			(over intercom)
		Okay, let's go.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon races away.  It is closely followed by three TIE fighters, 
all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.  
Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.

Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the 
cockpit supported by Lando.  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie 
barks in joyous relief.

				LUKE
		Oh, Leia.

				LANDO
		All right, Chewie.  Let's go.

Leia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.

EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY

The Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from 
the cloud-covered city.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff.  
Leia gently wipes his face.  The ship lurches again.

				LEIA
		I'll be back.

She kisses him, then leaves the quarters.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound.  Lando anxiously watches 
the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some 
switches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing 
on the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the 
shape.

				LEIA
		Star Destroyer.

				LANDO
		All right, Chewie.  Ready for 
		light-speed.

				LEIA
		If your people fixed the 
		hyperdrive.

Another explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the 
panel next to her flashes on.

				LEIA
		All the coordinates are set.
		It's now or never.

Chewie barks in agreement.

				LANDO
		Punch it!

The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The 
sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense, 
expectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets 
out a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship.

				LANDO
		They told me they fixed it.  I 
		trusted them to fix it.  It's not 
		my fault!

Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives 
Lando and angry shove as he storms past him.

EXT. SPACE

In the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting 
lasers.  Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly 
following the Falcon.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett 
approaches him.

				PIETT
		They'll be in range of our 
		tractor beam in moments, my lord.

				VADER
		Did your men deactivate the 
		hyperdrive on the Millennium 
		Falcon?

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

				VADER
		Good.  Prepare the boarding party 
		and set your weapons for stun.

				PIETT
		Yes, my lord.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Beeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio 
who now has one leg attached. 

Chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.

				THREEPIO
		Noisy brute.  Why don't we just 
		go into light-speed?

Artoo beeps in response.

				THREEPIO
		We can't?  How would you know the 
		hyperdrive is deactivated?

Artoo whistles knowingly.

				THREEPIO
		The city's central computer told 
		you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better 
		than to trust a strange computer.
		Ouch!  Pay attention to what 
		you're doing!

Chewie is in the pit.  He is trying to loosen something with an 
enormous wrench.  Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits 
the panel...

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly 
sprayed by a shower of sparks.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased 
by the TIE fighters.  As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader's breathing 
gets slightly faster.

				VADER
		Luke.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke realizes that Vader's ship is very near.  He feels resigned to his 
fate.  He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically.

				LUKE
		Father.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Son, come with me.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon.  Meanwhile, in the 
ship's hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive 
mechanism.

				LANDO
			(into intercom)
		Chewie!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE 
fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window.  He is almost 
unconscious with pain and depression.

				LUKE
		It's Vader.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				VADER
		Luke... it is your destiny.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

				LUKE
		Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

				PIETT
		Alert all commands.  Ready for 
		the tractor beam.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board.  
Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo, come back at once!  You 
		haven't finished with me yet!
		You don't know how to fix the 
		hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do 
		it.  I'm standing here in pieces, 
		and you're having delusions of 
		grandeur!

Artoo moves a circuit on a control panel.  Suddenly, the control panel 
lights up.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon 
unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

The ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, you did it!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer 
which seems, by contrast, to stand still.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror.  Vader 
turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back 
in a contemplative gesture.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL CRUISER

The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking 
tube.  Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel 
transport ship hovers near the fleet.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink.  Chewie 
busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff.

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

				LUKE
			(over comlink)
		Good luck, Lando

				LANDO
			(into comlink)
		When we find Jabba the Hut and

INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand.  
Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.

		Chewie, I'll be waiting for your 
		signal.

Chewie's wail comes over the comlink.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Take care, you two.  May the 
		Force be with you.

Luke looks down at his hand.  A metalized type of bandage has been 
wrapped around his wrist.  The medical droid makes some adjustments in 
a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers.

				LUKE
		Ow!

Luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.  His hand is 
completely functional.

He gets up and walks over to Leia.  There is a new bond between them, a 
new understanding.  Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about 
his uncertain and newly complicated future.  Together they stand at the 
large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star 
Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.

Luke puts his arm around Leia.  The droids stand next to them, and 
Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him.  The group 
watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and 
zooms away into space.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL STAR CRUISER

While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the 
star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.  Slowly, the 
cruiser turns and moves away into space.

                                    THE FORCE AWAKENS



           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

          CUT TO BLACK.

          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

                         ARE IN:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

                         QUIET:

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

          ROLLS OFF FAST --

          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

                          POE
           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           "The General." To me, she's royalty.
           Well, she certainly is that.

                          POE
          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           We've got company.

          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

                          POE
           You have to hide.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You have to leave. Go!
          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

                          POE
           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

          IN THE DISTANCE.
          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

                          POE (CONT'D)
           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

                          POE
           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --

          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

                         HIM:

                          SENIOR TROOPER
           Stay here.
          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

                          KYLO REN
           Look how old you've become.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           Something far worse has happened to
           you.
          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
          stormtroopers.

                          KYLO REN
           You know what I've come for.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
           I know where you come from. Before
           you called yourself Kylo Ren.

                          KYLO REN
           The map to Skywalker. We know you've
           found it, and now you're going to
           give it to the First Order.
          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           The First Order rose from the dark
           side... you did not.

                          KYLO REN
           I'll show you the dark side.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You may try, but you cannot deny the
           truth that is your family.
          Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

          PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --

          YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --

                          KYLO REN
           You're so right.
          And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
          Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT

          OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
          Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
          VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
          legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
          Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.

                          POE
           So who talks first? You talk first?

                          KYLO REN
           The old man gave it to you.

                          POE

                          (INDICATES KYLO'S

                          MASK)
           It's just very hard to understand
           you with all the...

                         

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          KYLO REN

                          (TO TROOPERS)
           Search him.

                          POE
           ... Apparatus.
          The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
          brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
          Poe just glares as the pat down ends.

                          STORMTROOPER #1
           Nothing, sir.

                          KYLO REN
           Put him on board.
          Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
          Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-

          CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Sir, the villagers.

                          KYLO REN
           Kill them all.
          Phasma nods, steps forward:

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           On my command!
          The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.

           CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
           Fire!
          Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
          All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
          ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing,

                         BACKS AWAY:

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          STORMTROOPER #2
           Nothing here. Go ahead!
          Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing --
          destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
          from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
          going.
          In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
          frightened.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports
          and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT

          Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the
          hangar. He is awed by the imposing space.

                          POE
           All right. All right!
          Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his
          helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR
          THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
          in this moment, terrified, desperate.
          After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
          knows he's in trouble.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           FN-2187. Submit your blaster for
           inspection.

                          FN-2187
           Yes, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           And who gave you permission to remove
           that helmet?

                          FN-2187
           I'm sorry, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Report to my division at once.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY

          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER

          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY

          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY

          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
          engine and DRIVES OFF.

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

          SPACESHIPS.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
          Refueling, small trade, scavengers.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
          sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
          her speeder toward the town.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

                          UNKAR
           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY

          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)
          CONTINUED: just 'cause.
          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

                          REY
           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

                          REY (CONT'D)

           NOMA.
          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           That's just Teedo. Wants you for
           parts. He has no respect for anyone.
           Your antenna's bent.
           (considers BB-8 for
           the first time,

                          STRAIGHTENS THE

                          ANTENNA)
           Where do you come from?

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Classified. Really? Me too. Big
           secret.
           (points to horizon)
           Niima Outpost is that way, stay off
           Kelvin Ridge.

                         CONTINUED:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Keep away from the Sinking Fields in
           the north, you'll drown in the sand.
           (stands, heads off)

                         
          BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.

                         

                         

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Don't follow me. Town is that way.
           (he BEEPS again)
           No!
          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
          on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           In the morning, you go.

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You're welcome.
          The two disappear behind a dune.

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

          POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up.

                          KYLO REN
           I had no idea we had the best pilot
           in the Resistance on board.
           Comfortable?
          Through battered lips:

                          POE
           Not really.

                          KYLO REN
           I'm impressed. No one has been able
           to get out of you what you did with
           the map.

                          POE
           Might wanna rethink your technique.
          Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in
          the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching
          him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --

                          KYLO REN
           Where is it?

          Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

          WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce,
          confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him:

                          KYLO REN
           It's in a droid. A BB unit.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll
           soon have it.

                          KYLO REN
           I leave that to you.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          BB-8 is dropped to the sand.

                          REY
           Don't give up. He still might show
           up. Whoever it is you're waiting
           for. Classified. I know all about
           waiting.
          BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           For my family. They'll be back.
           One day. Come on.
          She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads
          off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window.
          He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.

                          UNKAR
           These five pieces are worth... Let
           me see here... One half portion.

                          REY

                          (OBJECTS)
           Last week they were a half portion
           each.
          She hates him. He leans forward.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

           What about him?

                          UNKAR
           I'll pay for him.
          BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.

                          UNKAR (CONT'D)
           Sixty portions.
          CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of
          food, her stomach practically rumbles.
          BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this
          conversation at all.
          She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
          Finally, she hears herself say:

                          REY
           Actually... the droid's not for sale.

                          (TO BB-8)
           Come on.
          Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
          watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:

                          UNKAR
           Follow the girl and get that droid.
          He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.

           This is a rescue, I'm helping you

           I need a pilot.
          And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile.

                          POE
           We're gonna do this.

                          FN-2187

          The TIE Fighter blasts from the ship --

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it.

                          POE
           Woooahhh! This thing really moves.
           All right, we gotta take out as many
           cannons as we can or we're not gonna
           get very far!

                          FN-2187
           All right!

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN
          THE LEVELS OF THE MASSIVE SHIP, then FLIES DOWN AND BACK,
          along the ship's belly --

          INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

          Poe flies toward the CANONS --

                          POE

           I've got us dead centered. It's a

          Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history.

                          POE
           FN-whaa?

                          FN-2187

           me!

           Well I ain't using it! FN, huh?
           Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn!
           That all right?
          Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.

                          FINN
           "Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that!
           I like that!

          General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at
          a console.

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--

                          GENERAL HUX
           Use the ventral cannons.

           General Hux. Is it the Resistance
           pilot?
          Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, and he had help.

                          (VEXED)
           From one of our own.

           ... The one from the village. FN-

           2187.
          Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's
          Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir. Ventral cannons hot.

                          GENERAL HUX

           Disabled. They were headed back to

           crash in the Goazon badlands.

                          GENERAL HUX
           They were going back for the droid --
           send a squad to the wreckage.

          EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY

          TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
          to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
          WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
          A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
          Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
          gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:

                          FINN
           Poe! Poe!
          Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
          SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
          sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
          He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
          to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Poe!!! POE!
          Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
          INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

                          FINN (CONT'D)

           POE!!! POE!!!
          It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
          get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
          as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
          few moments and IT'S GONE.
          Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
          ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
          Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
          And all alone.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
          Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
          nothingness.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
          massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
          ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY

          General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
           Capture the droid if we can, but
           destroy it if we must.

                          KYLO REN
           How capable are your soldiers,
           General?

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (WITH VITRIOL)
           I won't have you question my methods.

                          KYLO REN
           They're obviously skilled at
           committing high treason. Perhaps
           Leader Snoke should consider using a
           clone army.

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH)
           My men are exceptionally trained --
           programmed from birth--

                          KYLO REN
           Then they should have no problem
           retrieving the droid. Unharmed.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Careful, Ren. That your "personal
           interests" not interfere with orders
           from Leader Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           I want that map. For your sake, I
           suggest you get it.
          Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

                          FINN
           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

          BEEPING BB-8.
          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

                          REY
           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

                          REY
           What's your hurry, thief?

                          FINN
           What--?! Thief?
          BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

          FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           OW! HEY! What?!

                          REY
           The jacket! This droid says you
           stole it!

                          FINN
           I've had a pretty messed up day,
           alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
           stop accusing me -- OW!!!
           (BB-8 has ZAPPED him

                          AGAIN)

           STOP IT!

                          REY
           Where'd you get it? It belongs to
           his master.
          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

                          FINN
           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

                          (RELIVING IT)
           Poe didn't make it.
           (sees BB-8 is sad,

                          ROLLS OFF)
           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

                          REY
           So you're with the Resistance?

          Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

                          FINN
           Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
           the Resistance, yeah.

                          (WHISPERS)
           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

                          REY
           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

                          FINN
           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

                          REY
           BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
           he has to get back to your base.

                          FINN
           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

                          REY
           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
           myth.
          Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           What is it?
          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           (re: her hand)
           What are you doing?!

                          FINN
           Come on!
          Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
          SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through
          a maze of tents:

           Come on, BB-8!

                          REY
           Let go of me!

                          FINN
           No, we gotta move!

                          REY
           (pulls her hand back)
           I know how to run without you holding
           my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
           way!
          Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
          them! They disappear through a tent.
          TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
          come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

                          STORMTROOPER
           Call in the air strike!
          REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

          INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
          Quiet, urgent:

                          REY
           They're shooting at both of us!

                          FINN
           Yeah, they saw you with me! You're
           marked!

                          REY
           Well, thanks for that!

                          FINN
           I'm not the one who chased you down
           with a stick! Does anyone have
           blasters around here?!

                          REY

                          (TO BB-8)
           Are you okay?
          Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
          PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
          he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Stop taking my hand!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
          As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW

          FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT

          FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING --

          BB-8 ROLLING!

                         

                         
          WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
          EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
          Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
          afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
          Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
          ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

                          REY
           Hey!
          As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:

                          FINN
           -- Are you okay?
          And that very question touches her -- having never in her
          life been asked it.

                          REY
           Yeah.
           (extends her hand)
           Follow me.
          Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off.
          LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-

          8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

          Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn
          and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO
          TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. They YELL:

                          FINN
           We can't outrun them!
          Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:

                          REY
           We might in that quad-jumper!

                          FINN
           We need a pilot!

                          REY
           We've got one!

           (then, indicates one

                          OFF-CAMERA)
           What about that ship?

                          REY
           That one's garbage!
          They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT
          IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a
          quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           The garbage'll do!
          She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all
          run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first
          time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
          TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up
          the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and
          the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit:

                          REY
           Gunner position's down there!

                          FINN

                          (CLIMBS DOWN)
           Y'ever fly this thing?

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat,
          frantically flips switches. BB-8 rolls in behind her as the
          ENGINES WHINE to life:

                          REY
           No! This ship hasn't been flown in
           years!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

          Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT
          WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to
          steady himself.

                          FINN
           Great.
           (reacts to seat)
           Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey bucks herself up. Doesn't believe her quick words:

          Rey pulls the yoke:

          THE FALCON ENGINES LIGHT UP BRIGHT!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

          The FALCON RISES, WILDLY -- ITS TARPS FLY OFF -- THE SHIP

          SPINS AND TILTS, SLAMS INTO AND CRUMBLES THE TOWN'S ARCHWAY!
          From the tents, Unkar Plutt runs out, SCREAMS:

                          UNKAR

           HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!!
          The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Rey pilots, headed for the sky!
          Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS.

                          FINN
           Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay
           low!

                          REY

           WHAT?

                          FINN
           Stay low! It confuses their tracking!
          For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to
          the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!

                          REY
           BB-8, hold on!
          Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke,
          stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.

                          REY

           I'M GOING LOW!!!

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC,
          UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand.
          Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING!
          Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They
          are ROCKED BY A BLAST!

          Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP:

                          FINN
           I'm working on it! Are the shields
           up?
          Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.

                          REY
           Not so easy without a co-pilot!
          Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:

                          FINN
           Try sitting in this thing!
          Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and
          SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING!

          The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK,
          TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING!
          The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE
          IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor.

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          The TIE FIGHTER CRASHES amid the DEBRIS, THREE SCAVENGERS
          instantly there to consume the new bounty.
          The Falcon, pursued by the ONE REMAINING TIE FIGHTER, slaloms
          through the MASSIVE WRECKAGE, GRAZING THE OLD SHIPS as she
          goes, pieces flying.
          The TIE FIGHTER FIRES -- HITTING THE FALCON'S LOWER TURRET,

          SPINNING IT, JAMMING IT INTO FORWARD POSITION!

          The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she
          scans the area -- and gets an idea.

          Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space

          The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer.
          Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT!
          FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES,

          REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY

          The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard

          Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           You're ok. He's with the Resistance.
           He's going to get you home. We both
           will.

                          (TO FINN)
           I don't know your name.

                          FINN
           Finn. What's yours.

                          REY
           I'm Rey.
          BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO
          HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.

                          FINN
           Rey...
          But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge,
          STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.

                          REY
           Help me with this! Quick!
          They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls
          over, watches.

                          FINN
           Whoa! What's going on?
          She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.

          EXT. SPACE - DAY

          The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

          Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the
          star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir. We were unable to acquire the
           droid on Jakku.
          Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           It escaped capture aboard a stolen
           Corellian YT model freighter.

                          KYLO REN
           The droid... stole a freighter?

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Not exactly, sir. It had help.
          Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           We have no confirmation, but we
           believe FN-2187 may have been helped
           in the escape--
          Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE
          BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces.
          The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka
          looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing
          scars.

                          KYLO REN
           Anything else?
          Mitaka hates to say the following, but:

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           The two were accompanied by a girl.
          Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD
          REN, into his black glove:

                          KYLO REN
           What girl?

           It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris
           wrench -- check in there!
          As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below,
          overwhelmed by the technical issues --

           They're hunting for us now, we gotta
           get outta this system!
          Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.

                          REY
           BB-8 said the location of the
           Resistance Base is "need to know" --
           if I'm taking you there, I need to
           know!

           This?
          She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8
          alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his
          moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You gotta tell us where the base is.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I don't speak that. Alright, between
           us, I'm not with the Resistance,
           okay?
           (BB-8 backs up)
           -- I'm just trying to get away from
           the First Order -- but you tell us
           where your base is, I'll get there
           first -- deal?!
           (BB-8 COCKS his head)
           Droid, please.
          Rey pops up again:

                          REY
           Pilex driver, hurry!
          Finn moves for the tool.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           So where's your base?

                          FINN
           (searching, to BB-8)
           Go on BB-8, tell her.

                          (QUIETLY)
           Please!
          She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole
          situation, then BEEPS.

          Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey
          disappears below again.

                          FINN
           Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's
           the one -- get us there as fast as
           you can.
          A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends
          his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.

                          REY
           I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

           No, that one! No. No. The one I'm

           tank will overflow and flood the

          Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool.
          He throws her the tape, she disappears below:

           You got a family? You got a

          The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:

                          REY
           None of your business, THAT'S WHY!
          But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.

          Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads
          off one way, Han in another.
          The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look
          up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening.
          They're SCARED.

           stole it from the Irving Boys, who
           stole it from Ducain.

                          HAN
           Who stole it from me! Well, you
           tell him Han Solo just stole back
           the Millennium Falcon for good.
          Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't
          see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles.

          Yup: Han stops in his tracks.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You are the Han Solo that fought
           with the Rebellion. You knew him.
          The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn.

                          HAN
           Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.
          Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten

                          LOOSE--
          Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then
          BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN:

                          FINN
           Wait -- a what?! Did you just say
           Rathtars? Hey!

          INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY

          The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han
          moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him.

                          FINN
           You're not hauling Rathtars on this
           freighter, are you?

                          HAN
           I'm hauling Rathtars.
          On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE
          SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is
          LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Oh great. It's the Guavian Death
           Gang -- they must've tracked us from
           Nantoon.
          Han heads off as:

                          REY
           What's a Rathtar?

          INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY

          Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo
          containers.

           I got three of 'em going to King
           Prana.

          Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.

          CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND

          CO. ARE THERE.

                          HAN
           Get below deck and stay there until
           I say so -- don't even think about
           taking the Falcon.

                          REY
           What about BB-8?

                          HAN
           He stays with me -- until I get rid
           of the gang, then you can have him
           back and be on your way.

                          FINN
           What about the Rathtars... where are
           you keeping them?
          A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS
          into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart
          stops.

                          HAN
           There's one.

                          REY
           What are you gonna do?

                          HAN
           Same thing I always do: talk my way
           out of it.

                          (CHEWIE MOAN-TALKS)
           Yes, I do. Every time.

          INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY

          A PORTAL opens. The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. One man in
          a SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass
          UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop
          at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet
          away in the middle of the long hall.

                          BALA-TIK
           Han Solo. You are a dead man.
          Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back
          and forth at the gang, and Han.

                          HAN
           Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

                          BALA-TIK
           The problem is we loaned you fifty
           thousand for this job.

          They look up, trying to get a view.

                          REY
           Can you see them?

                          FINN
           No.
          They start crawling down the crawl space.

                          BALA-TIK
           I heard you also borrowed fifty
           thousand from Kanjiklub.

                          HAN
           You know you can't trust those little
           freaks! How long've we known each
           other?
          Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:

                          REY
           They have blasters...

                          FINN
           A lot of 'em.
          We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company
          in the distance.

                          BALA-TIK
           The question is how much longer will
           we know each other? Not long. We
           want our money back now.

           I spent that money.

                          BALA-TIK
           Kanjiklub wants their investment
           back, too.

                          HAN
           I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

                          BALA-TIK
           Tell that to Kanjiklub.
          The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he
          turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB
          MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.
          Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its
          LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:

                          HAN
           Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
          Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:

                          TASU LEECH
           Wrong again, Solo. It's over for
           you.
          Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous.
          Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start
          CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.

                          HAN
           Boys. You're both gonna get
           what I promised! Have I ever
           not delivered for you before?

                          BALA-TIK
           Yeah.

                          TASU LEECH
           Twice!
          Han realizes he's right.

                          HAN
           What was the second time?

                          BALA-TIK
           Your game is old. There's no one in
           the galaxy left for you to swindle.

           two fugitives.
          Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense.
          BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes:
          Finn and Rey are in real trouble.

                          HAN
           First I've heard of it.
          Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid.
          Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):

                          RAZOO QIN-FEE
           Search the freighter.
          One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,
          AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for:
          FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING
          FAST in the opposite direction they came.
          Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at
          a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.

                          REY
           Wait wait wait wait. If we close
           the blast doors in that corridor, we
           can trap both gangs!

                          FINN
           Close the blast doors from here?

                          REY
           Resetting the fuses should do it.
          Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as
          they do. Finn quickly joins in.
          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
          optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
          DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a
          GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --

          SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!
          BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.
          The GANGS look around.
          Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY:

                          HAN
           ... I got a bad feeling about this...
          Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below,
          where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.

                          REY
           Oh no.

                          FINN

           Kill them! And take the droid!
          The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND

          THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS
          SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY!
          Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as
          a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The
          Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT.

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

          Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

          Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing
          Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the
          corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to
          help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a
          distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way.
          Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --
          they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE
          TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we
          land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out,
          quickly.

           FINN!!!!
          Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she
          realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light
          up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --
          and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN
          BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then

          WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately
          shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg!
          Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is
          adrenaline-rushed, in shock:

          Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han

          exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls.
          THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE
          IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a

                          (TO FINN)
           You take care of Chewie!
          Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie,
          who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters
          fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat.

                          HAN
           Hey, where are you going?

           not going anywhere.

                          HAN
           I hate that guy.
          Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:

                          REY
           And you could use a co-pilot.

                          HAN
           I got one, he's back there.

          IN THE LOUNGE, CHEWIE IS IN PAIN --

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Han and Rey in the seats:

           Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of

                          (SHOCKED)
           From inside the hangar? Is that
           even possible?

                          HAN
           I never ask that question until after
           I've done it.
          A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its
          GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           This is not how I thought this day
           was gonna go -- angle the shields --
           Hang on back there!
          IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a
          first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --

          Three GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON --
          hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD!
          The ship is hit.

                          HAN
           Come on baby, don't let me down!
          He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           What?!
          But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.

                          REY
           Compressor.
          Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch
          again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH
          LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED
          BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY
          as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:

          EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

          Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving
          the cargo ship behind.

          INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

          PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window,
          SEETHING. Makes a CALL:

                          BALA-TIK
           Inform the First Order that Han Solo
           has the droid they want. And it's
           aboard the Millennium Falcon.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET,
          frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet
          that has been hacked and modified into something sinister.
          Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice
          very much in control, of power:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           The droid will soon be delivered to
           the Resistance...

          INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at
          someone addressing them.
          We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS
          in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
          LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
          feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
          and powerful, all at the same time.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          SNOKE
           ... Leading them to the last Jedi.
           If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi
           will rise.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Supreme Leader, I take full
           responsibility for th--

           General! Our strategy must now
           change.

                          GENERAL HUX
           The weapon. It is ready. I believe
           the time has come to use it. We
           shall destroy the government that
           supports the Resistance, the Republic.
           Without their friends to protect
           them, the Resistance will be
           vulnerable, and we will stop them
           before they reach Skywalker.
          Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

                          SNOKE
           Go. Oversee preparations.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, Supreme Leader.
          General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him
          go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.

                          SNOKE
           There's been an awakening. Have you
           felt it?

                          KYLO REN
           Yes.

                          SNOKE
           There's something more. The droid
           we seek is aboard the Millennium
           Falcon. In the hands of your father,
           Han Solo.
          Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.

                          KYLO REN
           He means nothing to me.

                          SNOKE
           Even you, master of the Knights of
           Ren, have never faced such a test.

           By the grace of your training, I
           will not be seduced.

                          SNOKE
           We shall see. We shall see.
          A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed,
          filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque
          evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been
          a HOLOGRAM all along.

          EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY

          RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot,
          ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where
          CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER.

          SPARKS!

                          HAN
           Electrical overload!

                          REY
           I can fix that!

                          HAN
           The coolant's leaking!

           -- Secondary tank, I got it!

          INT. LOUNGE:

          CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage
          on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off.

                          FINN
           Chewie, come on! I need help with
           this giant hairy thing! Stop moving!
           Chewie!

          INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


                          HAN
           You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal
           with me!

          INT. LOUNGE:

          As Finn struggles to bandage the Wookiee:

                          FINN
           Hurt him?! He almost killed me six
           times!
           (Chewie GRABS HIM by
           the collar, ROARS)
           Which is fine.

          INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


                          HAN
           This hyperdrive blows there's gonna
           be pieces of us in three different
           systems.
          Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied,
          sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           What'd you do?

                          REY
           I by-passed the compressor.
          He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits,
          walking past BB-8.

                          HAN
           Move, Ball.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

          Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han
          checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.

                          HAN
           Nah, don't say that, you did great.
           Just rest.
          Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside
          him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Good job, kid. And thanks.

                          FINN
           You're welcome.
          Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the
          PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces
          start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to
          turn it off.

                          HAN
           So, fugitives, huh?

                          REY

           ... I'm just a scavenger.
          Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages
          to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.

                          HAN

          BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC

          MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS.
          They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through
          stars, becomes reflective.

                          HAN
           This map's not complete. It's just
           a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared,
           people have been looking for him.

                          REY
           Why'd he leave?

                          HAN
           He was training a new generation of
           Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned
           against him, destroyed it all. Luke
           felt responsible... He walked away
           from everything.

                          FINN
           Do you know what happened to him?

                          HAN
           There're a lot of rumors. Stories.
           The people who knew him the best
           think he went looking for the first
           Jedi temple.

                          REY
           The Jedi were real?

                          HAN
           I used to wonder that myself. Thought
           it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --
           magical power holding together good,
           evil, the dark side and the light.

          An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle
          some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises
          and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back

                         DOWN:

           You want my help? You're getting

          The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a
          CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE.
          The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN,
          smallish freighters.

          Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side.
          She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side,

           on my back. Are there any
           conspirators here? First Order
           sympathizers?

                          HAN

          Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the

           You might need this.

           You know how to use one of these?

                          REY
           Yeah, you pull the trigger.

                          HAN
           There's a little bit more to it than
           that. You got a lot to learn. You
           got a name?

                          REY
           Rey.

                          HAN
           Rey. I've been thinkin' about
           bringing on some more crew, Rey. A
           second mate. Someone to help out.
           Someone who can keep up with Chewie
           and me, appreciates the Falcon.

           Are you offering me a job?

                          HAN
           I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't
           pay much.

                          REY
           You're offering me a job.

                          HAN
           I'm thinking about it.
          Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she
          can't cross.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Well?

                          REY
           If you were, I'd be flattered. But
           I have to get home.
          Han looks at her, questioningly.

                          HAN
           Jakku?
          Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.

                          REY

                          (BEAT)
           I've already been away too long.

                          HAN

                          (TO CHEWIE)
           Chewie, check out the ship as best
           you can.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes
           you.
          Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Han walks them to the castle.

                          FINN
           Solo, why are we here again?

                          HAN
           To get your droid on a clean ship.

                          REY
           Clean?

           Do you think it was luck that Chewie
           and I found the Falcon? If we can
           find it on our scanners, the First
           Order's not far behind. Want to get
           BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata
           is our best bet.

                          FINN
           We can trust her, right?

                          HAN
           Relax, kid. She's run this watering
           hole for a thousand years. Maz is a
           bit of an acquired taste, so let me
           do the talking. And whatever you
           do, don't stare...

           REY AND FINN
           At what?

                          HAN
           Any of it.
          The door opens. Music. Madness. And...

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

          We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a
          room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble,
          drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the
          BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who
          suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS
          TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES.
          This is MAZ KANATA.

                          MAZ
           Han Solo!
          Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here.

                          HAN
           (Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving)
           Hey, Maz!
          NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.

                          MAZ
           Where's my boyfriend?

                          HAN
           Chewie's working on the Falcon.

                          MAZ
           I like that Wookiee. I assume you
           need something. Desperately. Let's
           get to it.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey
          are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do --
          passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE
          NETAL, who watches them suspiciously.
          A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8
          following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a
          small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.

                          GA-97
           Alert the Resistance. Their missing
           droid is here!
          And we CUT TO:

          IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER
          Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a
          communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled:

                          BAZINE
           Inform the First Order... I've found
           the droid.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY

          A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone
          OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see.

                          KYLO REN
           Forgive me. I feel it again. The
           pull to the light. Supreme Leader
           senses it. Show me again, the power
           of the darkness, and I will let
           nothing stand in our way. Show me,
           Grandfather, and I will finish what
           you started.
          As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW
          HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,

          ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY

          Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says:

                          MAZ
           A map to Skywalker himself? You're
           right back in the mess.

                          HAN
           Maz, I need you to get this droid to
           Leia.

           Hmm. No. You've been running away
           from this fight for too long. Han,
           nyakee nago wadda. Go home!

                          HAN
           Leia doesn't want to see me.

                          FINN
           Please, we came here for your help.

                          REY
           What fight?

                          MAZ
           The only fight: against the dark
           side. Through the ages, I've seen
           evil take many forms. The Sith.
           The Empire. Today, it is the First
           Order. Their shadow is spreading
           across the galaxy. We must face
           them. Fight them. All of us.

                          FINN
           There is no fight against the First
           Order! Not one we can win. Look
           around. There's no chance we haven't
           been recognized already. I bet you
           the First Order is on their way right--
          Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing
          him -- her eyes get HUGE.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           What's this? What are you doing?
          Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly
          BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the
          tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards
          Finn.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Solo, what is she doing?

                          HAN
           I don't know, but it ain't good.

                          MAZ
           If you live long enough you see the
           same eyes in different people. I'm
           looking at the eyes of a man who
           wants to run.

                          FINN
           (eyes on Maz)
           You don't know a thing about me.
           Where I'm from. What I've seen.

           You don't know the First Order like
           I do. They'll slaughter us. We all
           need to run.
          Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her
          chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.

                          MAZ
           You see those two? They'll trade
           work for transportation to the Outer
           Rim. There, you can disappear.
          Finn sees them. Considers.

                          REY
           Finn!

                          FINN

                          REY
           What about BB-8? We're not done
           yet. We have to get him back to
           your base.

                          FINN
           I can't.
          Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.

                          HAN
           Keep it, kid.
          Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses
          back to normal, and turns to Han.

                          MAZ
           Who's the girl?

                         ON FINN
          Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.

                          FINN
           I was told you could get me to the
           Outer Rim.
          Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.

                          REY
           What are you doing?
          Finn gets up to talk to her.

                          FINN
           (to Big Head)
           Don't leave without me.

           You can't just go. I won't let you.

                          FINN
           I'm not who you think I am.

                          REY
           Finn, what are you talking about?

                          FINN
           I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero.
           I'm a Stormtrooper.

                          (STOPS HER)
           Like all of them, I was taken from a
           family I'll never know. And raised
           to do one thing...

                          (EMOTIONAL)
           But my first battle, I made a choice.
           I wasn't going to kill for them. So
           I ran.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Right into you. And you looked at
           me like no one ever had. I was
           ashamed of what I was. But I'm done
           with the First Order. I'm never
           going back. Rey, come with me.

                          REY
           Don't go.

                          FINN
           Take care of yourself. Please.
          Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
          watches Finn return to the aliens...
          And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
          back at her one last time.

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

          DOOR OPENS.
          Hesitant, Rey enters.

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY

          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

                          YOUNG GIRL

           NO!
          She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

                          YOUNG GIRL
           No, come back!

           Quiet, girl!
          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

                          REY
           What was that? I shouldn't have
           gone in there.

                          MAZ
           That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
           father's before him and now, it calls
           to you!
          Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.

                          REY
           I have to get back to Jakku.

                          MAZ
           Han told me.
           (reaches out, hold

                          REY'S HAND)
           Dear child. I see your eyes. You
           already know the truth. Whomever
           you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
           never coming back. But... there's
           someone who still could.

                          REY
           Luke.

                          MAZ
           The belonging you seek is not behind
           you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,
           but I know the Force. It moves
           through and surrounds every living
           thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.

                          MAZ (CONT'D)
           The light. It's always been there.
           It will guide you. The saber. Take
           it.
          Rey suddenly stands.

                          REY
           I'm never touching that again. I
           don't want any part of this.
          And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
          Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
          heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
          her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
          Heads toward the woods.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
          HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
          come.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY

          A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
          OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
          SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
          RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

                          GENERAL HUX
           Today is the end of the Republic!
           The end of a regime that acquiesces
           to disorder! At this very moment,
           in a system far from here the New
           Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
           secretly supporting the treachery of
           the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
           machine which you have built, upon
           which we stand, will bring an end to
           the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
           All remaining systems will bow to
           the First Order! And will remember
           this... as the last day of the
           Republic!

                         

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of
          nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY


                          GENERAL HUX

           FIRE!
          And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a
          ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
          to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

          SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC

          BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO
          THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!
          The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
          FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
          For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
          Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
          CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
          Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
          eyes, CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

          TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY

          Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
          makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
          runs cold, his heart sinks.

          EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

          At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL

          SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST

          FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!

          EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT

          The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
          structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
          horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
          FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN

          APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
          NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING

          ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
          FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
          horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           FINN (O.S.)
           It was the Republic.
          Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through
          the crowd. With dread:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           The First Order, they've done it.
           Where's Rey?

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
          overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
          she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
          A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

                          REY
           What are you doing?

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You have to go back.
           (he BEEPS again)

                          REY (CONT'D)
           BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to
           go back, you're too important.
           They'll help you.
          Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
          front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
          ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

          FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:

                          MAZ
           I've had this for ages...

          MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
          Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Kept it locked away.

                          HAN
           Where'd you get that?

                          MAZ
           A good question for another time.

                          (TO FINN)
           Take it! Find your friend!
          Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.

                          MAZ (CONT'D)
           Those beasts! They're here!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
          SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
          DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
          OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
          and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
          Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
          STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

                          STORMTROOPER
           FN-417, hold position!
          Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE!
          She panics, then realizes:

                          REY
           Safety!
          SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
          and retreats, calls to BB-8:
          BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
          chasing Troopers!

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches:

                          STORMTROOPER #4
           Sir, the droid was spotted heading
           west, with a girl.
          Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:

                          REY
           You have to keep going, stay out of
           sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.
           (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely
           through her fear)
           I hope so, too.
          BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
          a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --

          EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

          Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through
          debris.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          HAN
           Come on, Chewie!
          Maz turns to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now
           go.

                          FINN
           I need a weapon.
          Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.

                          MAZ
           You have one!
          He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
          lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON.
          HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at
          Stormtroopers, taking some out!

                          HAN
           Hey, can I try that?
          Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
          and sends them flying.

                          HAN (CONT'D)

                          (TO CHEWBACCA)
           I like this thing.
          FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then
          another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
          Stormtrooper has a MACE --

                          STORMTROOPER
           Traitor!
          FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper
          KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him,
          when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS!
          Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!
          Han helps him up.

                          HAN
           You okay, Big deal?

                         

                          FINN
           Thanks!
          But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.

                          STORMTROOPER
           Don't move! TK-338, we have targets

          Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them.
          Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward
          a transport, hands on their heads.
          But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han
          turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-

          WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE

          FIRST ORDER SHIPS!

          The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED
          in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT

          UP.

                          HAN
           Quick!
          Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster
          aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer.
          And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
          COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
          Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
          Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
          again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

          DEFLECT EVERY BLAST.
          She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand
          rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE.

                          KYLO REN
           The girl I've heard so much about.
          He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           The droid.
          He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS

          HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           Where is it?

          WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST

          ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES
          TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After
          a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand.
          She is relieved but still afraid.

                          KYLO REN
           The map. You've seen it.
          Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
          stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
          She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony --
          Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE
          EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.

                          STORMTROOPER #5
           Sir, Resistance fighters! We need
           more troops.
          Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.

          Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS.
          FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of
          breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY
          IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS --
          Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle.
          Han is ROCKED.

                          FINN

           NO!! REY!!!
          Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS
          AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally

          CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           No, no, no, no... REY!!
          In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the
          receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order
          ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads

          BACK FOR THE CASTLE.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Post battle. Finn runs to Han:

                          FINN
           He took her! Did you see that? He
           took her. She's gone!

                          HAN

                          (WALKS PAST)
           Yeah, yeah, I know...
          And he and Chewie head off.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris.
          BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport.
          ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
          Finally, the transport door opens.
          And standing there is LEIA.
          She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
          wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
          embers, no one says a word.
          Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

                          C-3PO
           Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-
           Threepio!
           (sees Han, stops)
           You probably don't recognize me
           because of the red arm.
           (sees Leia,

                          INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)
           Look who it is! Did you see who?
           Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General.
           Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Yes, I must get my proper arm
           reinstalled.
          He hurries off. Finally, alone again.

                          HAN
           You changed your hair.

                          LEIA
           Same jacket.

                          HAN
           No, new jacket.
          Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
          a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
          It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son.
           He was here.
          Leia hears this.
          Maz watches through the smoke.

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant
          trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING
          to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS,
          a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium
          Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate,
          searching.
          Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
          Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
          THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.

          IT IS POE!
          Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
          WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the
          droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't
          believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a
          distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.

                          FINN
           Poe. Poe Dameron.
          They move to each other -- and embrace.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You're alive!

                          POE
           So are you!

                          FINN

                          POE
           What happened? I got thrown from
           the crash, woke up at night -- no
           you, no ship, nothing--
          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           BB-8 says that you saved him.

                          FINN
           No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

                          POE
           You completed my mission, Finn.
           That's my jacket?

           Poe -- I need your help.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift
          command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They
          arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance
          Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA:

                          POE
           General Organa. Sorry to interrupt,
           this is Finn, he needs to talk to

                          LEIA
           (takes Finn's hand)
           And I need to talk to him. That was
           incredibly brave, what you did.
           Renouncing the First Order, saving
           this man's life --

                          FINN
           (surprised she knows)
           Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of
           mine was taken prisoner--

                          LEIA
           Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
          Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:

                          POE
           Finn's familiar with the weapon that
           destroyed the Hosnian system. He
           worked on the base.

                          LEIA
           We're desperate for anything you can
           tell us.

                          FINN
           That's where my friend was taken --
           I've got to get there, fast.

                          LEIA
           And I will do everything I can to
           help, but first you must tell us all
           you know.

          C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a
          BASE COMPUTER. THE PROJECTED MAP APPEARS in HOLOGRAM. Leia
          enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING
          HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.

                          C-3PO
           General, I regret to inform you, but
           this map recovered from BB-8 is only
           partially complete. And even worse,
           it matches no charted system on
           record. We simply do not have enough
           information to locate Master Luke.

                          LEIA
           I can't believe I was so foolish to
           think that I could just find Luke
           and bring him home.

                          HAN
           Leia...

                          LEIA
           Don't do that.

                          HAN
           Do what?
           She heads off.

                          LEIA
           Anything.
           Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.

                          C-3PO

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
          dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off
          the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T
          RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
          R2. Nothing. Then:

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           BB-8. You're wasting your time.
          BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           It is very doubtful that R2 would
           have the rest of the map in his backup
           data.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in
           low power mode ever since Master
           Luke went away. Sadly, he may never
           be his old self again.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns.

                          HAN
           Listen to me, will you? I know every
           time you... every time you look at
           me, you're reminded of him.

                          LEIA
           You think I want to forget him? I
           want him back!
          Han looks at her with sympathy.

                          HAN
           There was nothing we could've done.
           (hard for him to say)
           There was too much Vader in him.

                          LEIA
           That's why I wanted him to train
           with Luke. I just never should have
           sent him away. That's when I lost
           him. That's when I lost you both.

           We both had to deal with it in our
           own way. I went back to the only
           thing I was ever good at.

                          LEIA
           We both did.

                          HAN
           We lost our son, forever.

                          LEIA
           No.

                          (LONG BEAT)
           It was Snoke.
          Han takes this in.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           He seduced our son to the dark side.
           But we can still save him. Me.
           You.

           Luke is a Jedi... you're his father.

          Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright
          restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask
          in place, standing there.

                          REY
           Where am I?

           You're my guest.

                          REY
           Where are the others?

                          KYLO REN
           You mean the murderers, traitors and
           thieves you call friends?
           (Rey stares at him)
           You'll be relieved to hear that I
           have no idea.

          Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You still want to kill me.

                          REY
           That happens when you're being hunted
           by a creature in a mask.
          Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
          and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
          before she regains her own mask of defiance.

                          KYLO REN
           Tell me about the droid.

                          REY
           (a nervous beat)
           He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
           and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

                          KYLO REN
           He's carrying a section of a
           navigational chart. We have the
           rest, recovered from archives of the
           Empire. We need the last piece.
           And somehow, you convinced the droid
           to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
          Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You know I can take whatever I want.
          Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
          his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
          go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
          THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
          between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
          And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
          quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           ... You're so lonely... so afraid to
           leave...
           (then, slight smile)
           At night, desperate to sleep... you
           imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
           the island...
          Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
          break free, but can't budge.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           And Han Solo. You feel like he's
           the father you never had. He would've
           disappointed you.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:

                          REY
           -- Get out of my head --
          But this just makes Kylo lean closer.

                          KYLO REN
           I know you've seen the map. It's in
           there... and now you'll give it to
           me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
           too.
          Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:

                          REY
           I'm not giving you anything.

                          KYLO REN
           We'll see.
          He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --

          DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
          On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
          slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
          certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
          FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

          AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED

          AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!

                          REY
           ... You... you're afraid... that you
           will never be as strong as... Darth
           Vader!
          KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were
          FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body
          is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on
          Kylo Ren, who starts to leave.
          And we PRELAP:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           This scavenger, resisted you?

          INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           She's strong with the Force, untrained
           but, stronger than she knows.
          And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:

                          SNOKE
           And the droid?

                         CONTINUED:
          Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:

           GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
           Ren believed it was no longer valuable
           to us.
          Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the
          platform beside Ren.

           GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
           That the girl was all we needed. As
           a result, the droid has most likely
           been returned to the hands of the
           enemy. They may have the map already.
          Snoke is visibly furious.

                          SNOKE
           Then the Resistance must be destroyed
           before they get to Skywalker.

                          GENERAL HUX
           We have their location. We tracked
           their reconnaissance ship to the
           Ileenium system.

                          SNOKE
           Good. Then we will crush them once
           and for all. Prepare the weapon.
          Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant
          at all --

                          KYLO REN
           Supreme Leader. I can get the map
           from the girl. I just need your
           guidance.

                          SNOKE
           If what you say about this girl is
           true, bring her to me.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's
          happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
          emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
          moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
          She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
          intense beat. Then says:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.

           What did you say?
          Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her
          confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
          Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
          laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           I'll tighten those restraints,
           scavenger scum!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And
          tries again.

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.

           I will remove these restraints. And
           leave this cell, with the door open.
          He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS
          AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS
          IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:

                          REY
           And you will drop your weapon.

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           And I'll drop my weapon.
          The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --
          Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has

          LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN.
          REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in

          WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR
          the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces
          of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor.
          Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP
          TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast.

           They've somehow created a hyper

           planet itself.

                          BRANCE
           A laser cannon?

           How is it possible to power a weapon
           of this size?

                          FINN
           It uses the power of the sun. As
           the weapon is charged, the sun is
           drained until it disappears.
          An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.

                          LEIA
           (eyes on datacard)
           The First Order: they're charging

           (then, heart sinking)
           Our system is the next target.

           Oh my. Without the Republic fleet,
           we're doomed.

           In order for that amount of power to

           There is one.

                          HAN
           Their shields have a fractional
           refresh rate. Keeps anything
           traveling slower than lightspeed
           from getting through.
          Finn is suddenly filled with dread.

                          FINN
           We're gonna make our landing approach
           at lightspeed?!
          Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!

                          HAN
           Alright, Chewie, get ready.
          Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           And Now!
          Chewie and Han hit switches --

                         

          EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE/STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          The Falcon's ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS INSTANTLY FROM LIGHTSPEED TO
          PLANET ATMOSPHERE -- it's suddenly FLYING 100 FEET ABOVE THE

          SNOWY, ROCKY GROUND, HEADED FOR A THICK FOREST!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY


                         CHEWIE GROANS:

                          HAN

           I AM PULLING UP!!!

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          But the Falcon has no time -- it PLOWS through the trees!
          It then RISES --

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          ALARMS BLARE as the ship SLAMS THROUGH BRANCHES, SHOOTS TOWARD
          SKY! Han does his best to steer -- Chewie GROANS -- in the
          madness Han YELLS:

                          HAN
           I get any higher, they'll see us!
          And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY

          A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the
          MILLENNIUM FALCON HURTLES OUT OF THE FOREST! From an eruption
          of BRANCHES and PINE, the ship DIVES -- SLAMS INTO THE SNOW!
          It DIGS THROUGH A THOUSAND YARDS OF WHITE until it finally
          comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie
          cross the terrain. WALKERS appears on the horizon. Han,
          Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. Chewie
          carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES.

                          FINN
           The flooding tunnels are over that
           ridge. We'll get in that way.

                          HAN
           What was your job when you were based
           here?

                          FINN
           Sanitation.

                          HAN
           Sanitation? Then how do you know
           how to disable the shields?

                          FINN
           I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.

                          HAN
           People are counting on us! The galaxy

          They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE

          DRY.

          A STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. The
          door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there!

                          STORMTROOPER FN-9330
           Hey!
          He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE
          ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead.
          Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a
          corner, wary.

                          HAN
           The longer we're here, less luck
           we're going to have. The shields?

           I have an idea about that.
          Han and Chewie follow Finn.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY

          Captain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers.
          Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF

          FRAME BY CHEWIE!
          And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS

          ARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER
          ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn.

          Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
          the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
          WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
          behind her.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY

          A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
          Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
          infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
          between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
          makes her way ACROSS.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

          WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off
          into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED
          SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as
          she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY

          CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION --
          Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. Phasma reluctantly
          works controls on the workstation.

                          FINN
           You want me to blast that bucket off
           your head? Lower the shields.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           You're making a big mistake.

                          FINN
           Do it.
          Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the
          controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on

           (to Finn, cruel)
           You can't be so stupid as to think
           this will be easy. My troops will
           storm this block and kill you all.

                          FINN
           I disagree. What do we do with her?

                          HAN
           Is there a garbage chute? Trash
           compactor?

           Finn. What are you doing here?!

                          FINN
           We came back for you.
          She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to
          do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           What'd he say?

                          REY
           (shrugs, smiles, though
           nearly in tears)
           ... That it was your idea.
          Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

                          FINN
           How did you get away?

                          REY
           I can't explain it. And you wouldn't
           believe it.

                          HAN
           Escape now. Hug later.

          The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of
          the snowy planet. INTERCUT BETWEEN the ships SCREAMING past
          each other, and the COCKPITS of the Resistance and First
          Order fighters. Poe's fighter NEARLY COLLIDES with a close-

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          The X-wings ROAR across the sky, BLASTING and DODGING the

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out
          here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the
          lop-sided battle.

          THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES.
          A long moment of communication.

                          HAN
           They're in trouble. We can't leave.
           (to Finn, re: Chewie)
           My friend here has a bag full of
           explosives. Let's use 'em.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          A Resistance Technician turns to Leia:

           KAYDEL KO CONNIX
           General, are you seeing this?

                          VOBER DAND
           Two more X-wings down. That's half
           our fleet destroyed.

                          C-3PO
           And their weapon will be fully charged
           in 10 minutes! It would take a
           miracle to save us now.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY
          STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. Instantly,
          Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and
          the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true.

          ALARMS START BLARING!

          INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS

          Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service
          hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics
          of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of
          Rey.
          And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and:

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout,
          step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS.

                          HAN
           That girl knows her stuff.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones.

                          HAN
           We'll set the charges at every other
           column.
          He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           You're right. That's a better idea.
           (checks his detonator)
           You take the top.

                          (CHEWIE DOES)
           I'll go down below. Detonator.
           We'll meet back here.
          They head off in opposite directions.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear
          and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS

          A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches.
          CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation,
          Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and
          CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure.
          SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards.

                          KYLO REN
           Find them.
          They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking
          carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter.
          They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO
          CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the
          shadows of the grillwork.

          Once they're gone, he plants another charge.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
          and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY

          GONE.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

          Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when
          he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide,
          vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
          demeanor changes --
          HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
          down into the filter.
          Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
          WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
          toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
          OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
          From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

          HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
          watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
          THAT BISECTS the open space.
          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
          CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
          edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

                          HAN
           Ben!
          The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
          catwalk. He turns.

                          KYLO REN
           Han Solo. I've been waiting for
           this day for a long time.
          Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
          that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like
          a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing
          and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on
          the catwalk below.

           Take off that mask. You don't need
           it.

                          KYLO REN
           What do you think you'll see if I
           do?
          Han moves toward Kylo Ren.

                          HAN
           The face of my son.
          Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face
          of his son for the first time as a man.

                          KYLO REN
           Your son is gone. He was weak and
           foolish, like his father. So I
           destroyed him.

                          HAN
           That's what Snoke wants you to believe
           but it's not true. My son is alive.
          SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS

          Kylo flares.

                          KYLO REN
           No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
          UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
          dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
          ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

                          HAN
           Snoke is using you for your power.
           When he gets what he wants, he'll
           crush you -- you know it's true.
          Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

                          KYLO REN
           It's too late.

                          HAN
           No it's not. Leave here with me.
           Come home. We miss you.
          For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
          flood his stoic eyes...

                          KYLO REN
           I'm being torn apart. I want to be
           free of this pain.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS

          Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

                          KYLO REN
           I know what I have to do, but I don't
           know if I have the strength to do
           it. Will you help me?
          Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

                          HAN
           Yes. Anything.
          Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
          Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
          it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
          LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

          VANISHES.
          Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
          but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH

          DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS

          OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

                          KYLO REN
           Thank you.
          ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --

                          (ALSO PANTING)
           No, no.
          Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
          KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
          REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his
          life slipping away.
          Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF

          THE STRUCTURE!

          Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself
          horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when --
          CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO
          REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.

          then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH
          ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for
          them with long strides.
          Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,

          From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from
          the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a
          rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.

                          FINN
           The Falcon's this way.
          Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
          forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
          out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
          they can't run.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes
          out the saber, ignites it.
          A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.

          STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.
          Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.

          After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
          Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
          she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
          Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's
          BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey
          FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away!
          She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.

           no no no...
          Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF
          KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO
          REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.

                          KYLO REN

           TRAITOR!
          In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           That lightsaber. It belongs to me!

                          FINN
           Come get it.
          Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo
          Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but
          Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!
          Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,
          COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys
          this challenge more!
          Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
          men fighting, through the trees.
          Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
          with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
          moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!
          LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --
          wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES
          AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK,
          the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers:
          And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
          Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.
          Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF
          BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses
          balance.

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET!
          Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S

          LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE.

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW.
          Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

          FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN --

          -- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!

          KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF

          REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF,

          BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS

          SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!
          Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

          FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING.
          Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER.
          It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the
          defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked
          by her raw, innate skill.

          INT. X-WING - NIGHT


                          NIV LEK
           We just lost R-1!

                          JESS
           We're overwhelmed! What do we do?
           It isn't working!
          Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming
          from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:

                          YOLO ZIFF
           Black Leader, there's a brand new
           hole in that oscillator. Looks like
           our friends got in!

                          POE
           Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!

           LT. BASTIAN
           I'm on it!

                          ELLO ASTY
           Roger!

                          POE
           Everybody else, hit the target hard!
           Give it everything you got!
          And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the
          trench leading to the oscillator structure!

                          POE
           I need some help here! I need some
           help!

           LT. BASTIAN
           I'm coming in!

                          JESS
           Watch out!

                          ELLO ASTY
           I'm hit!
          The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.

                          POE
           All teams - I'm going in! Pull up
           and cover me!

                          NIV LEK
           Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck,
           Poe!
          The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts
          into the fiery breach.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS

          Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH

          THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN:

                          STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
           Weapon at full capacity in thirty
           seconds.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Prepare to fire.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
          fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
          interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
          volley of torpedoes.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --
          and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground

          EXPLOSIONS!

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S
          BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW
          as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
          She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
          dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
          MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
          Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
          DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A

          MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!

                          KYLO REN
           You need a teacher! I can show you
           the ways of the Force!

                          REY
           The Force.
          Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
          she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
          SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
          FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
          BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
          Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
          GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES

          AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND

          CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
          SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
          And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
          But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
          even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
          SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
          giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
          watches this out the control room window in horror. He
          hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:

                          COLONEL DATOO
           Lieutenant, get back to your station!

                          YOUNG TECHNICIAN
           (stops, fleetingly)
           Just look. We won't survive -- even
           Hux has gone!
          As he hurries off, WE HEAR:

           GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
           Supreme Leader.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
          distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
          but is horrified, heartsick:

                          GENERAL HUX
           The fuel cells have ruptured. The
           collapse of the planet has begun.
          Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.

                          SNOKE
           Leave the base at once and come to
           me with Kylo Ren.

                          (GRIM)
           It is time to complete his training.

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
          FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
          FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
          sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.

                          REY
           Finn! Finn...
          Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
          body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
          holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
          They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
          planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
          is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:

          LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
          KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights

          ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
          CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!

          EXT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie exits the ship.
          MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
          with them back into the ship --

          INT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
          see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
          US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

          INT. X-WING - NIGHT


                          POE
           All teams! I got eyes on them!

                          SNAP
           Yes!
          The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
          IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
          get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
          Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
          corner of the galaxy.
          The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
          headed home.

                          POE
           Our job's done here. Let's go home!

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
          Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
          carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
          meet them, usher them inside.

                          MEDIC
           Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
           heartbeat.
          Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
          C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
          Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
          The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
          face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
          She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
          Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
          their losses.
          As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
          stirs. The droids beep at each other.

                          C-3PO
           R2-D2! You've come back! You found
           what? How dare you call me that!

                          (MORE)

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           (he swats R2-D2, who

                          CONTINUES BEEPING)
           Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
           must go tell the others at once!

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           General? Excuse me, General?
          Leia turns to see droids.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           R2-D2 may contain some much needed
           good news.

                          LEIA
           Tell me.
          Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
          Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

          LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

                          POE
           Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
          Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
          San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
          back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
          SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

          TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN

          R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
          Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

                          C-3PO
           Oh! The map! It is complete!

                          LEIA
           (hand on her heart)
           -- Luke --
          Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
          C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

                          C-3PO
           (to R2-D2)
           Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
           you.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY

          A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
          uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
          despite her fear:

                          REY
           We'll see each other again. I believe
           that. Thank you, my friend.

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

                          LEIA
           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

          EXT. SPACE - DAY

          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY

          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY

          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY

          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY

          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.

          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
          of an adventure, just beginning...

                         

                         

                          THE END
Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace



TITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by
a roll up, which crawls up into infinity.

EPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE

Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to
outlaying star systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the
greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of
Naboo.
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of
events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,
the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the
conflict.....

PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great
speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of
Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.

INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT


In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one
of the battleships.

QUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.

The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.

CAPTAIN : Yes, sir?
QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.
CAPTAIN : Yes, sir.

The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade
viceroy, waits for a reply.

CAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the
Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly
legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.

The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship
looms ever closer.

EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)

The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation
battleship.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE

A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER
DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.

PK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless
protocol gearheads to greet them.

The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.
Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.

TC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

They move off down the hallway.

EG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?
PR-4 : I'm not made to think.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the
formal conference room by TC-14.

TC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master
will be with you shortly.

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the
door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window
at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white
hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is
twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several
exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.

OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
QUI-GON : I don't sense anything.
OBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's
somethging...elsewhere...elusive.
QUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration
here and now where it belongs.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
QUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
living Force, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
the chancellor's demands?
QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.

NUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?
TC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
DOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,
we're done for!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference
room hallway.

NUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.

The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the
door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their
weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the
tray of drinks.

TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.

The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords
fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they
can fire.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the
viewscreen.

OWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...

OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried
look.

NUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?
RUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
NUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.
RUNE : That won't be enough, sir.

The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

NUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
RUNE : We will not survive this.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and
metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS
crashing into the wall.

QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.

NUTE : Close the blast doors!!!

The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then
a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs
the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the
center of the blast door.

RUNE : ...They're still coming through!

On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.

NUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!
RUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just
before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their
battle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.

QUI-GON : Destroyer droids!
OBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.

The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,
blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a
semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be
seen.

P-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!

The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the
doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with
their laser swords.

OBI-WAN : They have shield generators!
QUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL
DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.

RUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer
droids.
TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are
careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing
craft.

QUI-GON : Battle droids.
OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.
QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the
Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.
OBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW recieves a transmission.

TEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet.
RUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself.
NUTE : At last we're getting results.

On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her
elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING
COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.

NUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is
pleased.
AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,
Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

NUTE smirks at RUNE.

NUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.
AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of
yours.
NUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
AMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's
Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a
settlement.
NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.

AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.

AMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
NUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of
the Senate. You assume too much.
AMIDALA : We will see.

The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.

RUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....
NUTE : It's too late now.
RUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?
NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications
down there.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a
hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.

PALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the
Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
the...get...negotiate...

The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.

AMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?

CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT

CAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...
BIBBLE : A malfunction?
CAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not
dare go that far.
CAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be
finished.
AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
BIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the
Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend
ourselves.
CAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security
volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
AMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)

Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the
perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation
warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the
background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.
OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy
swamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)

The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.
OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the
rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.

RUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one
of your landing craft.
OOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of
the swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.
NUTE : Excellent.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the
monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run
past him in a panic.
An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has
retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue
snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the
wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a
charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam
shell in one hand.

JAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!

JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is
caught by surprise.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!
QUI-GON : Let go!

The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.
Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes
splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the
war machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.

JAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!

The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.

QUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR : I spake.
QUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta
here!

QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.

JAR JAR : No...no! Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble servaunt.
QUI-GON : That wont be necessary.
JAR JAR : Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa
culled Jaja Binkss.

In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing
OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : I have no time for this now...
JAR JAR : Say what?

The two STAPS barrell down on OBI-WAN.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....

QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.

QUI-GON : Stay down!

His head pops up.

JAR JAR : ...dieeee!

The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts
back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to
catch his breath.

OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.

OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR
JAR pulls himself out of the mud.

QUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?

OBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I
hope you've learned, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
JAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
OBI-WAN : What's this?
QUI-GON : A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.
JAR JAR : Mure? Mure did you spake??!?

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be
Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.

They all stop.

QUI-GON : A city! (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there?
JAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.
QUI-GON : No??!
JAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My
forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my
goen back dare.

A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.

QUI-GON : You hear that?

JAR JAR shakes his head yes.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading
this way...
OBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little
pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
JAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!

JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR
tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.

QUI-GON : Much farther?
JAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that
turn into breathing masks.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't
expict a wern welcome.
OBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.

JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the
water.
Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.

EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the
water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh
Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.
They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically
through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON follow.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS
armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The
GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping
trio.

JAR JAR : Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!
CAPT. TARPALS : Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big
dudu this time.

CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps
and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.

JAR JAR : How wude.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM

The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming
around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with
GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS
NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.

BOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new
weesong!
QUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
BOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink
day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big.
OBI-WAN : After those droids take control of the surface, they will come
here and take control of you.
BOSS NASS : No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no
nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of

OBI-WAN : You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of
you will affect the other. You must understand this.
BOSS NASS : Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no

QUI-GON : (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.
BOSS NASS : Wesa gonna speed yousaway.
QUI-GON : We need a transport.
BOSS NASS : Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen
through da core. Now go.
QUI-GON : Thank you for your help. We go in peace.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.

OBI-WAN : Master, whats a bongo?
QUI-GON : A transport, I hope.

The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict.
QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

JAR JAR : Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
QUI-GON : Thank you, my friend.
JAR JAR : Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.

JAR JAR's soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.

OBI-WAN : We are short of time, Master.
QUI-GON : We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This
Gungan my be of help.

QUI-GON walks bact to BOSS NASS.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS : Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be pune-ished.
QUI-GON : He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will not be
too severe.
BOSS NASS : Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR : (grimacing) Oooooh...Ouch!

OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.

QUI-GON : We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. I have
saved Jar Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
BOSS NASS : Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand.

QUI-GON : Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
BOSS NASS : Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone wit him.
JAR JAR : Count mesa outta dis! Better dead here, den deader in da

EXT. NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving
the glow of the settlement in the distance.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.

JAR JAR : Dis is nusen.
OBI-WAN : Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along
with us?...Here, take over.
JAR JAR : Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??
QUI-GON : You're the navigator.
JAR JAR : Yo dreamen mesa hopen...,br QUI-GON : Just relax, the Force will
guide us...
JAR JAR : Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Wellen, dat smells stinkowiff.

JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral
vistas are grand, fantastic, and wonderous.

OBI-WAN : Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
JAR JAR : Tis a long tale, buta small part wawdabe
mesa...ooooh...aaaa.....clumsy.
OBI-WAN : They banished you because you're clumsy?

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to
follow.

JAR JAR : Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say
boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished.

Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side.
QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked
them with its long gooey tongue.

QUI-GON : Full speed ahead.

Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse. The sub
flies into the mouth of the creature.

JAR JAR : Oooops.
OBI-WAN : Give me the controls.

OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases
the sub from its mouth.

JAR JAR : Wesa free!

As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the
hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The
lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the
gloom.

QUI-GON : There's always a bigger fish.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the
time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to
accept your control of the system.
NUTE : The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Queen Amidala is yound and naive. You will find controlling
her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.
NUTE : Thank you, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.

RUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
NUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the
power drive drops.

OBI-WAN : .....we're losing power.

OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.

QUI-GON : Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.
JAR JAR : What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and
nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
OBI-WAN : Power's back.

The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of
them.

JAR JAR : Monstairs back!

The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around
and speeds away.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Wesa in trouble now??
QUI-GON : Relax.

QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.

OBI-WAN : You overdid it.

The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the
tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.

OBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good!

JAR JAR regains consciousness.
JAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!

JAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the
deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so
lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips
away.

QUI-GON : Head for that outcropping.

EXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX)

The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to
Theed, the Naboo capital.

EXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)

As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport
carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.

NUTE : Ah, victory!

INT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is
brightly lit.

JAR JAR : Wesa dude it!

EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD
RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast
moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.
QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.

JAR JAR : Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON : Get this thing started.
JAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?
OBI-WAN : What is it?

JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a
huge waterfall.

JAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!

OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly
begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the
waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop
drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In
the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs
and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!

QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the
shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs
precariously over the edge of the waterfall.

QUI-GON : Come on...

OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON
starts in after him.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR : No! Too scary!
OBI-WAN : Get up here!
JAR JAR : No a mighty no!

JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!

JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to
pull QUI-GON out of the water.

OBI-WAN : That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!

The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.
JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.

BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons

QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut
down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks
lose, crashing down the waterfall.
The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.

JAR JAR : Whoa!!!

EXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY

The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,
PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and
FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the
middle of the room.

BIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
NUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will
legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by
the Senate.
AMIDALA : I will not co-operate.
NUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in
store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see
our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.
OOM-9 : Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four.

The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.

EXT. PALACE - PLAZA - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO
BIBBLE,
and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza
is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the
detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak
across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an
attack to rescue the QUEEN.

FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are
also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the
DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to
QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.

JAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!

QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.
They move between two buildings.

QUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme
Chancellor.
BIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
QUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make
contact with the republic.

CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.

CAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.
QUI-GON : Do you have transports?
CAPT. PANAKA : In the main hanger. This way.

THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks
in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are
behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE
DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.

CAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.
QUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the
circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.
CAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of
theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else
behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move
here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate
to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
CAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.
Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have
to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you
must leave...

The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.

AMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
PADME : We are brave, Your Highness.
QUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
AMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be
careful, Governor.

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE),
followed
by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and
SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.

CAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.

CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a
corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

OBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of
captured pilots.

QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP
approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.

GUARD DROID : Where are you going?
QUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those
people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD : You're under arrest!

The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire,
they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the
GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS
rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC
OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER
PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone has made it onto the
ship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger
and fire as the ship takes off.

EXT. THEED - HANGER ENTRY - DAY (FX)

The ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at
them.

EXT. SPACE (FX)

The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the
deadly Federation blockade.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.

RIC OLIE : ....our communications are still jammed.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five
short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for
thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.

JAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?

JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.
He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying
out.

JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi! Just yoken!
RIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main
power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.

The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The
Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.

RIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive
is leaking.
QUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.

OBI-WAN : Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The
Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT. PANAKA : How can you be sure?
QUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??
OBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.
CAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are
gangsters... If they discovered her...
QUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system
controlled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us an advantage.

CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft races away.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH
SIDIOUS.

NUTE : We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any
other settlements...
DARTH SIDIOUS : Destroy all high-ranking officials,
Viceroy...slowly...quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
NUTE : She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the
blockade.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
NUTE : My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
DARTH SIDIOUS : ...not for a Sith...

A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : (Cont'd) ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He
will find your lost ship.
NUTE : Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.
NUTE : (Cont'd) This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
RUNE : We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi
become aware of these Sith Lords?

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID stand before
QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE.

CAPT. PANAKA : ...An extremely well put together little droid. Without a
doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
AMIDALA : It is to be commended...what is its number?

The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps.CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over
and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:

CAPT. PANAKA : R2-D2, Your Highness.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!

PADME bows before the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : (Cont'd) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our
gratitude...(to Panaka) Continue, Captain.

CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.
It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will
be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
CAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled
by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on
this.
QUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.

AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astra Droid.
JAR JAR pops out of an open door.

JAR JAR : Hidoe!

Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The Gungan is
embarrassed that he frightened them.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.
PADME : That's all right.
JAR JAR : I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
PADME : Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.

JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.

JAR JAR : Mesa Ja Ja Binksss... PADME : I'm Padme, I attend Her Highness,
You're a Gungan, aren't you? (Jar Jar nods) How did you end up here with
us?
JAR JAR : Me no know...mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning

ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.

INT. ANBOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC OLIE'S shoulder. A
large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes.

OBI-WAN : Tahyt's it. Tatooine.
RIC OLIE : There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like.
QUI-GON : Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.

EXT. TATOOINE - SPACE (FX)

The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The spaceport
of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR rushes up
to him and falls to his knees.

JAR JAR : Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!
OBI-WAN : Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious.

JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer)
enters the main area.

OBI-WAN : (Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new
one.

QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.

QUI-GON : Don't let them send ant transmissions. Be wary...I sense a
disturbance in the Force.
OBI-WAN : I fell it also, Master.

QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR JAR. They head
to the exit ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the
distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport.

JAR JAR : Dis sun doen murder tada skin.

From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them.

CAPT. PANAKA : Wait!

QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant's garb.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden
with you. She wishes for her to observe the local...
QUI-GON : No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport
is not going to be pleasant...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
PADME : I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself.
CAPT. PANAKA : Don't make me go back and tell her you refuse.
QUI-GON : I don't have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay
close to me.

He gives PADME a stern look.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass
dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this
exotic enviroment.

QUI-GON : ...moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous
tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for
those who do not wish to be found...
PADME : ....like us. JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.

JAR JAR : Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze)
Ooooh...icky...icky...goo.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship
dealers.

QUI-GON : We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships
stacked up behind it.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are
greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a
hummingbird.

WATTO : (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?)
QUI-GON : I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
WATTO : Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk?
(subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!)
QUI-GON : My droid here has a readout of what I need.

A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about
nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and
ANAKIN flinches.

WATTO : (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like
you...)
WATTO : (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind! Watch the
store) Me dwana no bata. (I've got some selling to do here.) (to Gui-Gon)
Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need.

ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with
PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure
out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.

QUI-GON : Don't touch anything.

JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue.
ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME.
She is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a
little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile.
Finally, he gets the courage to speak.

ANAKIN : Are you an angel?
PADME : What?
ANAKIN : An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They
live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in
the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most
hardened spice pirate cry.

PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I've never heard of
angels.

ANAKIN : You must be one...maybe you just don't know it.
PADME : You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
ANAKIN : Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to
Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto,
who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
PADME : You're...a slave?

ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.

ANAKIN : I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME : I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around)This is a
strange world to me.

ANAKIN studies her intently.

ANAKIN : You are a strange girl to me.

JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it
instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around,
knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hit the nose!

JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original
state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair.

EXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands before a
hyperdrive.

WATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the
only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It
would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all
this?
QUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
WATTO : Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need
something more real...
QUI-GON : I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will
do fine.
WATTO : No they won'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand
again.
QUI-GON : Credits will do fine.
WATTO : No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your
hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only
money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all
come tumblimg down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down.
ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.

ANAKIN : ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing
things. I'm making my own droid...

QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We're leaving.
JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.

PADME : I'm glad I met you,....ah...
ANAKIN : ...Anakin.
PADME : Anakin.
ANAKIN : Anakin Skywalker.
PADME : Padme Naberrie.

PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.

ANAKIN : I'm glad I met you too.

WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head.

WATTO : (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia.
(Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center, we don't
know nothing.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO :
(subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you
can go home.)

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY

QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two
buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking
creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously
watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.

QUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on
board?
OBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe.
Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking
about.
QUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back.

QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR
grabs his arm.

JAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un
crunched.
QUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is
walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough
gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like
creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs
hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks
out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.
Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly
appears.

VENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!

JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets
around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR
moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the
hapless Gungan.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :
(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)

SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER
CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan
desperately tries to scramble to safety.

JAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.

JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up
to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,
Sebulba...This one's very connected.)

SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected?? Whada
you mean, slave?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda
co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one... I'd
hate to see you diced before we race again.)
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time
we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du
pom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.)

SEBULBA turns away.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if
you had to pay for me.)

QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange
goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called
Sebulba.
JAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
QUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.
Thank you, my young friend.

PADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down
the crowded street.

JAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by
squashing you...be less afraid.
PADME : And that works for you.
ANAKIN : To a point. (he smiles)

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and
begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.

OBI-WAN : This storm's going to slow them down.
CAPT. PANAKA : It looks pretty bad. We'd better seal the ship.

CAPTAIN PANAKA'S comlink sounds off.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Yes? CAPT. PANAKA : We'll be right there.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very poor,
old lady named JIRA.

ANAKIN : How are you feeling today, Jira?
JIRA : The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
ANAKIN : Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I
promise.
JIRA : You're a fine boy, Annie.
ANAKIN : I'll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You'll like these...

ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one.
QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not
hungry.

The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA
gives them their pallies.

JIRA : Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd
better get home quick.
ANAKIN : (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
QUI-GON : We'll hed back to our ship.
ANAKIN : Is it far?
PADME : On the outskirts.
ANAKIN : You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very,
very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!

The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - STREET - SANDSTORM - DAY

The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow ANAKIN down
the street and into a slave hovel.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living space.

ANAKIN : Mom! Mom! I'm home.
JAR JAR : Dissen cozy.

Anakin's mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters
from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.

SHMI : Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?
ANAKIN : These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know
any of your names.
QUI-GON : I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a
little beep.
PADME : ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
ANAKIN : I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
SHMI : Anakin! Why are they here?
ANAKIN : A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.

The wind HOWLS outside.

QUI-GON : Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
ANAKIN : Come on! Let me show you Threepio!

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping all the way.
QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to
SHMI.

QUI-GON : I have enough food for a meal.
SHMI : Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll
never get used to Anakin's surprises.
QUI-GON : He's a very special boy. SHMI looks at him as if he's discovered
a secret.
SHMI : Yes, I know.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one
eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.

ANAKIN : Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
PADME : He's wonderful!
ANAKIN : You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!

ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs
an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.

THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How
might I serve you?
PADME : He's perfect.
ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a
Podracer!

PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and
whistles.

THREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?

ARTOO BEEPS

THREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How
embarrassing!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO
BIBBLE hologram.

BIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is
catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us
what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...

AMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous.

OBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.

OBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent.
QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying?
QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time.

EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.

DARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I
will find them quickly, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no
difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will
have revenge.
DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will
be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is
going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.

The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the
city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the
outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave
quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift
table, having dinner as the wind howls outside.
JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a
little brighter red.

SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no
luck.
SHMI : Any attempt to escape...
ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!

PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.

JAR JAR : How wude.
PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
Republic's anti-slavery laws...
SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.

An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.

ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?

PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches
some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.
QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.

QUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.

SHMI looks askance at her son.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's
never heard of a human doing it.
QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.

ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl
with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and
forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.

JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of
the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.

ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...
QUI-GON : What?
ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
QUI-GON : What makes you think that?
ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.

QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.

QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
QUI-GON : I wish that were so...
ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the
slaves...have you come to free us?
QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...
ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?

QUI-GON thinks for a moment.

QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't
let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central
system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept
secret.
ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair
it.
ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!
QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we
need...
JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful
races.
QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used
properly.
ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.

QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.

SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto
makes you do it.

ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The
prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina
pitty bad goo.
GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who
might be able to help us?

SHMI shakes her head no.

ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in
the universe is no one helps each other...
SHMI : Anakin, don't...

JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.

PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will
find another way...
SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but
he can help you...he was meant to help you.
ANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!

The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and
rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts
shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing
next to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.

PADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
The Queen will not approve.
QUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know.
PADME : Well, I don't approve.

QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese.

WATTO : Patta go bolla!
ANKAIN : No batta!
WATTO : Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
ANAKIN : Bayno, Bayno!

QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.

WATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford
parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)
QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.

QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and
a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of
WATTO. He studies it.

WATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.
WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last
race. It will take some time to fix it.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.

ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his
vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever
built."
WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you
supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings
fifty-fifty, I think.
QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you
front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus
the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win.
WATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a
follish one, methinks.)

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY

OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink.
QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.

OBI-WAN : What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a
long time.
QUI-GON : (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and
there is something about this boy...

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch

PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in
the courtyard below.

QUI-GON : You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of
reward.
SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...
QUI-GON : He has special powers.
SHMI : Yes...
QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to
have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.
QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who
was his father?
SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him
birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
QUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have
identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the
way. But it's too late for him now, he's too old.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl
of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR,
ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring.

ANAKIN : Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and
Wald.

All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.

KITSTER : Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
ANAKIN : This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race
tomorrow!
KITSTER : What? With this??
WALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.)
AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to
run.
SEEK : Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be
bug squash.

SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of
the energy binder plates.

ANAKIN : Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
JAR JAR : Who, mesa?
ANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.

JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps
him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his
mouth is numb and his words are garbled.

JAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)
KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN : It will.

QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets
his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get
words out that make sense.

QUI-GON : I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN :
Yes, sir!!

ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts
the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR
JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with
a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The
BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.

QUI-GON : Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
ANAKIN : There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
QUI-GON : Most of them.
ANAKIN : Has anyone been to them all?
QU-IG0N : (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN : I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!

QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm.

QUI-GON : There, good as new...

SHMI yells from inside the hovel.

SHMI : (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!

QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.

ANAKIN : What are you doing?
QUI-GON : Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN : I've never seen...
SHMI : (O.S.) Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
QUI-GON : Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight.

ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the blood
stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
QUI-GON : Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
OBI-WAN : Wait a minute...
QUI-GON : I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN : All right. I've got it.
QUI-GON : What are your readings?
OBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON : Here's a signal check.
OBI-WAN : Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the
reading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON : (almost to himself) That's it then.
OBI-WAN : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON : No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN : What does it mean?
QUI-GON : I'm not sure.

The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him.
Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the
situation.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus,
scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and
studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the
lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on
his electronic armband.

Six football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three
different directions toward the cities.

DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his
electrobinoculars.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - SUNRISE

Padme exits the hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - SUNRISE

As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod. ANAKIN is
asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.

PADME : I hope you're about finished.

ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding toward them on
an EOPIE, a strange camel-lile creature. He is leading a second EOPIE
behind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he
sleeps. She watches him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up,
yawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.

ANAKIN : You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME : I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and
clean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as
KITSTER arrives.

ANAKIN : Hook 'em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?

PADME : He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being readied
for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making last minute fixes
on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.

WATTO : ...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
QUI-GON : Patienc, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the
suns set, and we'll be far away from here.
WATTO : Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny
business.
QUI-GON : You don't think Anakin will win?

WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his
shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.

WATTO : Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit
to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
QUI-GON : Why?
WATTO : He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
QUI-GON : I'll take that bet.
WATTO : (suddenly stops laughing) What??!! What do you mean?
QUI-GON : I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his
mother.
WATTO : A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the
mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.
QUI-GON : The boy is small, he can't be worth much.

WATTO shakes his head.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) For the fastest Pod ever built?!

WATTO shakes his head again.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet.
WATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or
nothing.
QUI-GON : The boy, then...

WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.

WATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...

WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.
QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.

WATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the
race, so...it makes little difference.

ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine.
KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO
walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting
on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.

WATTO : (Cont'd) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd.
(Better stop your friends betting, or I'll end up owning him, too.)

WATTO walks off, laughing.

ANAKIN : What did he mean by that?

QUI-GON : I'll tell you later.

ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.

THREEPIO : Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.

ARTOO emits a series of beeps.

THREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
dreadful starships!
KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time,
Annie.
PADME : Do what?
KITSTER : Finish the race, of course!
PADME : You've never won a race?
ANAKIN : Well...not exactly...
PADME : Not even finished?!

ANAKN looks sheepish.

ANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.
QUI-GON : Of course you will.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

One of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of
Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN,
QI-GON, or the QUEEN.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A
large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand
people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the
racetrack. INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.

FODE/BEED : -
A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos

classic. The most hazardous of all Podraces.)
B : That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the
Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto
the starting grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of
Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW
MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by
aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box.

FODE/BEED : -
(O.S) A : La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!)
B : I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system.
A : ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in thenew Ord
Pedrovia.)
B : Two time winner, Boles Roor...
A : Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du Pixelito! Splastyleeya

Pixelito. By far the favorite today.)
B : And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.
A : Wampa peedunkee unko ( I hope he has better luck this time.)
B : I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - GRANDSTAND - DAY

Colorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell barbecued
creature parts and colorful drinks.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

All the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the box and
waves to the crowd.

FODE/BEED : -
A : O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt, amu intoe tah parena. (His honor, our
glorious host, Jabba the Hutt has entered the arena.)

The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow, along with humans
and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are led alongside JABBA.

JABBA : (subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his fans. A small
pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer.

KITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin's Pod with a long cable. SHMI
gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye.

SHMI : Be safe.
ANAKIN : I will, Mom. I promise.

She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.

JABBA : ...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin
SKywalker tuta Tatoonine....

The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues with his
introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin's engines. KITSTER and
JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that
everything is OK. JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back.

JAR JAR : Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo.

PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek. SEBULBA bangs
on a part protruding from Anakin's engine. He looks around to see if anyone
has noticed.

PADME : You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN : I won't let you down.

PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and gives him a
sinister grin.

SEBULBA : Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. 9You
won't walk away from this one, slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it,
slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUI-GON
approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.

JABBA : (sutitled)...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge
begin!)

The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy
straps himself into the tiny racer.

QUI-GON : Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember, concentrate on
the moment. Feel. Don't think. Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the
Force be with you.

QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches,
and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a
switch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines
igniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a
droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The PILOTS
flip switches, and poerful energy binders shoot between the engines. Aliens
carrying large flags move off the track. JAR JAR covers his eyes.

JAR JAR : Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
FODE/BEED : -
A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The power couplings are being activated)
B : Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a veiwing platform. PADME and
JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like an elevator.

SHMI : Is he nervous?
QUI-GON : He's fine.
PADME : You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
QUI-GON : The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.
PADME : You assume too much.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

FODE/BEED : -
B : Start your engines.

The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the
start of the race.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The
Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods
and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around
him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer
started. The two-headed announcer reports.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : An dare ovv! (And they're off!)
B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

PADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm
around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin's engines
ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one
quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER
describes the race as it progresses.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the
leaders today.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with
MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA
drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock
formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.
ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.
One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him
on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side
ansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off,
then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast
that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.
Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the
Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of
Anakin's Pod.

FODE/BEED : -
B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on small,
hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder of a strange
alien named FANTA.

JAR JAR : Where's Skywalker?

FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar Jar's view. PADME, SHMI, and QUI-GON
watch another screen and look worried.
ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver
of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other
racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by
another racer, XELBREE.
SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side
vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the
alien's engine.
The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly
veers away.
ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a
dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.
One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the
whole thing EXPLODES.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for
any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information.
The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in
Anakin's defeat.
The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all
directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground
as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.
KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S)
B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings.
A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)

QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is
very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR :
What gooie-on?
FANTA : Bug off.

Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands
and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. QUI-GON and PADME
look worried.

JAR JAR : He musta crash-ud.
PADME : Here he comes!

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells.

THREEPIO : He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack.
The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in...
A : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)

ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is
unbearable.
ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of
the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out
the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,
then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for
some attention.)
ODY : Droids!

TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off
his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,
and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod
to his engines.
ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.
As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.
Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.
SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer
crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of
dust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the
cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely
followed by Skywalker...

ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the
rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes
through the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third
and last lap. WATTO begins to worry.
SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.
ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off
course.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!
A : Oh noah!

On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!

SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and
pushing him through the turns.
SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time
keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake
loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is
trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.
ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,
SEBULBA is able to block.
Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries
to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final
stretch of the track.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : He's catching Sebulba.
A : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)

SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN
over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering
rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.

FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
B : That little human being is out of his mind.
A : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)
B : They're side by side!
A : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)

As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering
rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is
tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts
spinning.
The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine
EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,
but unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws
what's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the
EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down
with excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle
hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line,
the winner.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX - DAY (FX)

The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.

FODE/BEED : -
B : It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah (rock head in
tandem with partner)

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY

As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds
of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off,
CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY

Several ALIENS leave Watto's box, laughing and counting their money. WATTO
sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.

WATTO : You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow
you knew it! I lost everything.

WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI-GON's.
QUI-GON simply smiles.

QUI-GON : Whenever you gamble, my freind, eventually you'll lose. Bring the
parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release
the boy.
WATTO : You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
QUI-GON : Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts...I'm sure they can
settle this.
WATTO : No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!

The SITH PROBE DROID watches with great interest.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The Main Hanger is almost deserted as RACERS depart.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

JAR JAR gives ANAKIN a great hug, then PADME gives him a hug, then SHMI.

ANAKIN : Ah, gee...enough of this...
SHMI : It's so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have
none. I'm so very proud of you...
PADME : We owe you everything.
ANAKIN : Just feeling this good was worth it.

In the background, QUI-GON has harnessed the EOPIES to containers full of
parts.

QUI-GON : Padme. Jar Jar, let's go, we've got to get these parts back to
the ship.

The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES.
PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second EOPIE,
only to slwly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI
wave as they ride off.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) I'll return the eopies by midday.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES;
JAR JAR ridses the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft.
OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.

QUI-GON : Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I'm going
back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.
OBI-WAN : Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
QUI-GON : It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts.

On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE DROID turns
and speeds away.

EXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting. About A
DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling. Suddenly, a long shadow
is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop fighting and look up. QUI-GOMN is
towering above them. KITSTER is with them.

QUI-GON : What's this?
ANAKIN : He said I cheated.
QUI-GON : Did you?
ANAKIN : No!
QUI-GON : Do you still think he cheated?
GREEDO : Yes.
QUI-GON : Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his
opinion, fighting won't change it.

QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO wanders over
to WALD who has been watching the goings-on.

WALD : Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.

Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin's hovel.
QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them
to the boy.

QUI-GON : These are yours. We sold the Pod.
ANAKIN : (suddenly beaming) Yes!

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!

ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.

SHMI : Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
QUI-GON : And Anakin has been freed.
ANAKIN : What?!?
QUI-GON : You're no longer a slave.

ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.

ANAKIN : Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize,
or what?
QUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about
gambling.
SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns
to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
QUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.
You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.
ANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your
starship and everything?!

QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.

QUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And
if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
ANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,
Mom?!
QUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it
is yours alone.

ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : I want to go.
QUI-GON : Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
ANAKIN : Yipee!!

ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and
QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has realized something.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't
you, Mom
QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.
ANAKIN : But the money from selling...
QUI-GON : It's not nearly enough.

SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands
in hers, she draws him close.

SHMI : Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let
go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
ANAKIN : I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
SHMI : You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from
setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.

ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI exchange a
look of concern. When ANAKIN raises up, there are tears in his eyes.

ANAKIN : I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...
SHMI : I love you, Annie...now hurry.

ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.

SHMI : (Cont'd) Thank you.
QUI-GON : I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
SHMI : He was in my life for such a short time.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - SECOND ROOM - DAY

ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack. As he leaves,
he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up. THREEPIO stares at
him blankly.

ANAKIN : Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...
THREEPIO : Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although
I'd like it better if I were a little less naked.
ANAKIN : I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you
coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great
pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.

THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.

THREEPIO : Sell me?!?

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin's hovel. SHMI
stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of coins out of his pocket
and gives them to KITSTER.

KITSTER : There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You're a
hero.
ANAKIN : I... (looks to SHMI) I... have to go.

QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.

KITSTER : Well.
ANAKIN : Well.
KITSTER : Thank's for every moment you've been here. You're my best friend.
ANAKIN : I won't forget.

ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to look back at his
mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to QUI-GON, then turns and
runs back to his mother.

ANAKIN : (starting to cry) I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She kneels down and
looks him in the face.

SHMI : Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase
the Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses
several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?

ANAKIN shakes his head.

SHMI : (Cont'd) This is one of those times when you have to do something
you don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you
can do this...
ANAKIN : Will I ever see you again?
SHMI : What does your heart tell you?
ANAKIN : I hope so...yes...I guess.
SHMI : Then we will see each other again.
ANAKIN : I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I
promise.
SHMI : No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and
don't look back... don't look back.
ANAKIN : I love you so much.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON, and off he
marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches right past
QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes, determined not to look
back.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - DAY

The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH LORD gets on a
speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into Mos Espa.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO'S and stop before JIRA'S fruit stand. ANAKIN
hands JIRA some coins.

ANAKIN : I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit
with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.

JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say.

JIRA : Can I give you a hug
ANAKIN : Sure.

She gives him a hug.

JIRA : I'll miss you, Annie.. there isn't a kinder boy in the galaxy. You
be careful...

ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the street. As
they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out of the corner of
his eye.
Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing
around, and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON
inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.

ANAKIN : What is it?
QUI-GON : Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I've seen before.
Come on.

QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is having a hard
time keeping up.

ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!

QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a
speeder bike.

QUI-GON : Anakin, drop!

ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL
jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord
has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by
QUI-GON.
ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are
bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof
dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets
up, bewildered by the confrontation.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go!

QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN races to
the ship.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where PADME and CAPTAIN
PANAKA are working.

ANAKIN : Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
CAPT. PANAKA : Who are you?
PADME : He's a friend.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

CAPTAIN PANAKA, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit where OBI-WAN and
RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.

CAPT. PANAKA : Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!
PILOT : I don't see anything.
OBI-WAN : Over there! Fly low!

In the distance is a small cloud of dust.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue theirsword battle. Leaping over one another
in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two warrios hear the ship fly
over them a few feet off the ground. QUI-GON almost dissapears for a
moment.
Before DARTH MAUL knows what's happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecrat's
ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY

The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON, but barely
makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop. QUI-GON swings
his laser sword with all his might and knocks DARTH AMUL off the ramp and
onto the desert floor. The ramp closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away,
leaving the Sith Lord standing alone.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON collapsed on the
floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him. The JEDI is breathing
hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt.

ANAKIN : Are you all right?
QUI-GON : I think so... that was a surpirse I wont soon forget.
OBI-WAN : What was it?
QUI-GON : I don't know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My
guess is he was after the Queen...
ANAKIN : Do you think he'll follow us?
QUI-GON : We'll be safe enough once we're in hyperspace, but I have no
doubt he knows our destination.
ANAKIN : What are we going to do about it?

OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a "who are you?" look. ANAKIN returns an innocent
stare.

QUI-GON : We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
ANAKIN : Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?

OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.

INT. COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN watch.

QUI-GON : Let's hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn't get the last
laugh.

The stars streak outside the cockpit window.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The ship streaks into hyperspace.

EXT. THEED - STREET - NIGHT (FX)

SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The Palace can be
seen in the distance.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches SIO
BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE follows a few paces behind.
DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS
watch.

NUTE : When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is
lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much
sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!
BIBBLE : This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people
have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.

BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.

OOM-9 : My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these
rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room.
She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is
stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he
rests.
PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with
a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking
verydejected. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his
eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm.

PADME : Are you all right?
ANAKIN : It's very cold.

PADME gives him her over-jacket.

PADME : You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is
cold.
ANAKIN : You seem sad.
PADME : The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must
convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen.
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll
ever see you again.. (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for
you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will
bring you good fortune.

ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it
around her neck.

PADME : It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things
will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always
remain.
ANAKIN : I care for you too. Only I...miss...

ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.

PADME : ...You miss your mother.

ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.

ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.

RIC OLIE : Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is
one big city.
ANAKIN : Wow! It's so huge!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY

Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on
a landing platform.
The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street
level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR
and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.
CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE,
and
MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME
smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.

PALPATINE : It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I
present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
VALORUM : Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in
person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant
situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your
position.
AMIDALA : I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform
toward a waiting air taxi.

PALPATINE : There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can
overcome it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR. QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the
duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the
taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a
skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks around)
Pitty hot!

VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.

QUI-GON : I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor. The
situation has become more complicated.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand
behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are
waiting in an adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what
is being said.

JAR JAR : Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN : Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.

CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY

PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one
side.

PALPATINE : ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of
greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and
their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility,
only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is
little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real
power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A
manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
AMIDALA : What options do we have?
PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces
the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence
in Chancellor Valorum.
AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
courts...
AMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide
things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each
day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
PALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to
accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX)

A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant
skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.
The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named
KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.

QUI-GON : ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU : A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI : Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we
must.
KI-ADI : I sense he will reveal himself again.
MACE WINDU : This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the
Queen is the target.
YODA : With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
MACE WINDU : We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and
discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.

YODA : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
QUI-GON : With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in
the Force.
YODA : A vergence, you say?
MACE WINDU : Located around a person?
QUI-GON : A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of
midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring
balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
QUI-GON : I don't pressume...
YODA : But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON : I request the boy be tested.

The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON.

YODA : Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
QUI-GON : Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that.
There is too much happening here...
MACE WINDU : Bring him before us, then.
YODA : Tested he will be.

INT. QUEENS QUARTERS - CORUSCANT - DAY Anakin, tentative, walks down one of
the long hallways in Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a dor
that is flanked by TWO GUARDS.

GUARD : May I help you, son?
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.

The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.

GUARD : The boy is here to see Padme.
RABE : Send him in.

The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.
RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.

ANAKIN : I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
RABE : I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.

The Queen speaks out in the next room.

AMIDALA : (O.S.) Who is it?
RABE : Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.

The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks
down, then takes a peek at her.

AMIDALA : I've sent Padme on an errand.
ANAKIN : I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.

The QUEEN just stares at him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say
goodbye.
AMIDALA : We will tell her for you. We're sure her heart goes with you.

ANAKIN bows again.

ANAKIN : Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.

EXT. CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)

A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape
of Coruscant.

INT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY

The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in
the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in
the center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,
QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo
congressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans
over to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,
Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
AMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
PALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I
promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...
Your Majesty, our only, chance.
AMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion
to a vote?
PALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.
VALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of
Naboo.

The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.

PALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has
occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute
you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade
routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the
Trade Federation.

A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with
Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.

LOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
VALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade
Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.

PALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently
elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.

AMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished
delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.
Invaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the
Trade...
LOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a
commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
VALORUM : Overruled.
LOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without
reasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.

A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS
MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.

AKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
VALORUM : The point...

VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.
PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on
the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor
Valorum's strength will dissapear.
VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen
Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to
explore the validity of your accusations?

QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.

AMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people
suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body
is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a
"vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
VALORUM : What?...No!

This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a
roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands
speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.

MAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...

Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.
PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.

BAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in
Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.

MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.

BAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must
be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures
committee for study.

The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.

ASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!

PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.

PALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be
voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong
Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
MAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will
begin the vote.

The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.

VALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have
betrayed me! How could you do this?

EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.

OBI-WAN : The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know
it. He is far too old.
QUI-GON : Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
OBI-WAN : Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
QUI-GON : I will do what I must.
OBI-WAN : Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would
just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
QUI-GON : You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET

ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held
viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.

ANAKIN : A ship...a cup...a speeder.

MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.

YODA : Good, good, young one. How feel you?
ANAKIN : Cold, sir.
YODA : Afraid are you?
ANAKIN : No, sir.
MACE WINDU : Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN : I don't think so.

ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.

YODA : See through you, we can.
MACE WINDU : Be mindful of your feelings...
KI-ADI : YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN : I miss her.
YODA : Afraid to lose her..I think.
ANAKIN : (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?
YODA : Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to
anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I
sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN : (quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA : Then continue, we will.

INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET

QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights
of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR
JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.

JAR JAR : Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
AMIDALA : To motivate us, I imagine...
JAR JAR : Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA : I don't know.
JAR JAR : Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
AMIDALA : I hope not.
JAR JAR : Gungans do die'n without a fight.... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta
grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.

PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the rom and bow before the QUEEN.

CAPT. PANAKA : Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to
succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
PALPATINE : A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your
Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I
will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence
over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
AMIDALA : Who else can be nominated?
CAPT. PANAKA : Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
PALPATINE : I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong
sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
AMIDALA : I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator,
there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
PALPATINE : I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the
Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
AMIDALA : With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do
here...Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have
decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
PALPATINE : Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in
danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
AMIDALA : I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from
that of our people. Captain!
CAPT. PANAKA : Yes, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Ready my ship!
CAPT. PANAKA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.
AMIDALA : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It
is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If
you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to
stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to
the Senate.

AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a self-satisfied smile
on his face.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - TWILIGHT

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI
COUNCIL.

YODA : ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
MACE WINDU : His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
KI-ADI : The Force is strong with him.
QUI-GON : He's to be trained, then.

The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.

MACE WINDU : No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.

QUI-GON : No??!!

OBI-WAN smiles.

MACE WINDU : He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...you must see it.
YODA : Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
QUI-GON : I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.

YODA : An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
MACE WINDU : We forbid it.
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan is ready...
OBI-WAN : Iam ready to face the trials.
YODA : Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?

ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.

QUI-GON : Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force,
but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn from me.
YODA : Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he
has...
MACE WINDU : Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new
Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure
on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
YODA : And draw out the Queen's attacker.
KI-ADI : Events are moving fast...too fast.
MACE WINDU : Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the
dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.

YODA : Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON : I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere
else to go.
MACE WINDU : He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
YODA : Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
MACE WINDU : Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war
until we have the Senate's approval.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the
ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the edge of the
platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly, he leans over too far and falls
overboard. After a moment, he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel
himself back onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he
listens to the JEDI.

OBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
QUI-GON : From your point of view....
OBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it. Why can't you?
QUI-GON : His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will decide
Anakin's future...that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON
goes over to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
QUI-GON : You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines
your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
ANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
QUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all
living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN : They live inside of me?
QUI-GON : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
ANAKIN : Symbionts?
QUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the
midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the
Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
ANAKIN : They do??
QUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to
you.
ANAKIN : I don't understand.
QUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.

Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO
TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by
QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her
HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve
and protect you.
AMIDALA : I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means
to destroy me.
QUI-GON : I promise you, I will not let that happen.

AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON
and ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Wesa goen home!

They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no
further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, is the planet secure?
NUTE : Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life
forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as
they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.

RUNE : A Sith lord here with us?!!

INT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT

ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and
gauges.

ANAKIN : ...and that one?
RIC OLIE : The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN : And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE : You catch on pretty quick.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEEN'S CHAMBERS

SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.

CAPT. PANAKA : The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force
you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON : I agree...I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
AMIDALA : I'm going to take back what's ours.
CAPT. PANAKA : There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no
army.
QUI-GON : I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
AMIDALA : Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.

JAR JAR : Mesa, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Yes. I need your help.

INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY

The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one
Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on
the view screen.

PANAKA : The blockade's gone.
OBI-WAN : The war's over...No need for it now.
RIC OLIE : I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN : A droid control ship.
PANAKA : They've probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN ; We haven't much time.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN HOLD

The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready to disembark
as the ship alnds. The elevator door slides open, and ANAKIN emerges into
the hold area. He see PADME and run up to her.

ANAKIN : Hi! Where have you been?
PADME : Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN : I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
I'm too old.
PADME : This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
ANAKIN : Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
PADME : To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld
decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a
peaceful people...
ANAKIN : I want to help...I'm glad you're back.

ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the
ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-GON.

OBI-WAN : Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.

QUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere.

QUI-GON : Good.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.

OBI-WAN : Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
QUI-GON : The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our
power to help her.
OBI-WAN : I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to
disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the
trials.

QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.

QUI-GON : You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than Iam,
Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - UNDERWATER - DAY (FX)

JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands, stunned, in
amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking.

JAR JAR : Ello! Where das everybody?

The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if
there had been a battle of some kind.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY

JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO,
FOUR
PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.

JAR JAR : Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink. Sorry,
no Gungas...no Gungas.
CAPT. PANAKA : Do you think they have been taken to camps?
OBI-WAN : More likely they were wiped out.
JAR JAR : No...mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go to sacred
place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
QUI-GON : Do you know where they are?

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR JAR stops and
sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.

JAR JAR : Dissen it.

JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of nowhere, CAPTAIN
TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS riding on KAADUS emerge from the brush.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.
CAPT. TARPALS : Binks!! Noah gain!
JAR JAR : We comen to see da boss.

CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.

CAPT. TARPALS : Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for all-n youse.

EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS - DAY

JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, PADME, RABE,
EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN
refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive
carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the
top of a three-quarter-submerged head.

BOSS NASS : Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who's da uss-en others??

QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.

AMIDALA : I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo...I come before you in peace.
BOSS NASS : Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en
omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die'n, mesa tink.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously,
and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed.
ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.

AMIDALA : We wish to form an alliance...

Suddenly, PADME steps forward.

PADME : Your Honor...

ARTOO whistles a quiet "uh oh."

BOSS NASS : Whosa dis?
PADME : I am Queen Amidala (points to Queen) This is my decoy...my
protection...my loyal bodyguard.

ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.

PADME : (Cont'd) ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the
circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not
always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in
peace...until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have
worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we
do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I
beg you to help us.

PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS NASS. There is
a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.

PADME : (Cont'd) We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.

Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL.
Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled
by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.

BOSS NASS : Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.
Maybe wesa bein friends.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in
the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive..
Lord Maul, be mindful.
DARTH MAUL : Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Be patient... Let them make the first move.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah, searching the
landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees something and yells
down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.

GUNGAN LOOKOUT : Daza comen!
ANAKIN : All right. They're here!

ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a
battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS
NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.

BOSS NASS : Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
JAR JAR : Oh, no, no, no...
BOSS NASS : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
JAR JAR : General??! Oh, no..

JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.
FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO
GUARDS
and PILOT pile out and join the group.

PADME : What is the situation?
CAPT. PANAKA : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I
could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much
stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
PADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away
from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the
waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create
a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.

PADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?
QUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're
inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
QUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be
killed.
BOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with
interest, as does ARTOO.

PADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send
what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting
the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication
and their droids will be helpless.
QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons
on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your
Highness, he will return with another droid army.
PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything
depends on it.

INT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through
the throne room.

DARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers
assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do
not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
DARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be
using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the
Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to
our advantage...
NUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE
- DAY (FX)

All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly
there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a
GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL
OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN
ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit
the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.
SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted
on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of
the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills.
HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.
Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the
GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on
the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line.
JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.

GENERAL CEEL : Energize the shields.

A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the
back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled
WARRIORS.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily
makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by
about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a
small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE
and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans
over to ANAKIN.

QUI-GON : Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe placeto hide and stay
there.
ANAKIN : Sure.
QUI-GON : And stay there!

DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza,
SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at
the BATTLE DROIDS.
As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush
into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage
the DROIDS outside.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and PADME's TROOPS
rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin firing at them as they run for
cover. ANAKIN runs under a Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at
PADME back onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle on a large view
screen.

NUTE : I thought the battle was going to take place far from here...this is
too close!
RUNE : What is going on?

DARTH MAUL enters the throne room.

DARTH MAUL : I told you there was more to this...the Jedi are involved.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY (FX)

The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are protected
by their energy shield. The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS CHEER, until
they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE
DROIDS are pulled out and lined up by a squad of STAPS.
The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position. The GUNGANS get
ready for an attack. OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS
OF DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS.
The GUNGANS power up their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march through the
protective shield and start firing. The GUNGANS throw their power poles and
fling small balls of energy with slingshots. The WARRIORS dump large balls
of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE
DROIDS, causing them to short out.
The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the
ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large bolts whiz
past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS
right and left. The QUEEN'S TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the
DROIDS. PADME signals to her pilots.

PADME : Get to your ships!

The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the
hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a fighter right above where ANAKIN
is hiding.

FIGHTER PILOT : Better find a new hiding place, kid. I'm taking this ship.

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as
it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a
second fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the second fighter
to hide.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY (FX)

Two Naboo starfighters exit the main hanger. A tank fires at them, hitting
one of them, which causes it to pinwheel into the ground and EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and overwlm the
few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with
CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.

She looks to QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : I agree.

They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where
ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the
cockpit.

ANAKIN : Hey! Wait for me.
QUI-GON : No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are.
ANAKNI : But, I...
QUI-GON : Stay in that cockpit.

They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly
everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN
PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) We'' handle this...

The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords. DARTH MAUL
takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both ends of the sword
light up.
At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into
their battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS. The
JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.

ANAKIN : Oh, no...

The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We gotta do something, Artoo.

ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship
begins to levitate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.
Let's see...

ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship
begins to shake.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....

ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out
several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster." Yeah!

The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have
moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily
distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a
palace hallway.
The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around
him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on
the right.

ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.

The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear
life.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!! Wrong one.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm not doing anything!

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know...I didn't push anything.

The SITH LORD's moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI at once,
flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on
the transmitter.
BRAVO TWO : Roger, Bravo Leader.

The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit the
hangers and attack.

RIC OLIE : Enemy fighters straight ahead!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY

JAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up in the
wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's
gun firing randomly, accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.
OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF
WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle.
They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves
once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with
energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space above Naboo.
ARTOO beeps a worried concern.

ANAKIN : The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?

ARTOO beeps and whistles.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire
it or something.

ARTOO chirps that he's trying.

ANAKIN : (cont'd) Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is
taking us.

ANAKIN's fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The SITH LORD drives the JEDI out of the hanger and nto the power generator
area next door.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

Three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordmanship. The JEDI
and the SITH LORD fight their way across the narrow bridge of the Theed
power generator. DARTH MAUL jumps onto the bridge above them. The JEDI
follow, one in front of the SITH LORD and one behind. They continue their
sword fight.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, EIRTAE, SABE and THIER TROOPS are trapped in a
hallway by BATTLE DROIDS.

PADME : We don't have time for this, Captain.
CAPT. PANAKA : Let's try the outside stairway.

CAPTAIN PANAKA blasts a hole in the window, and they make their way outside
the building onto a ledge about six stories above a raging waterfall. SABE,
EIRTAE and about TWENTY NABOO SOLDIERS stay in the hallway to hold off the
BATTLE DROIDS.

EXT. THEED - PALACE - OVER WATERFALL - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and about TEN OTHER NABOO SOLDIERS are lined up
along the edge. They have pulled small attachments out of their pistols and
fire at a ledge about four stories above them. Thin cables shoot out of the
pistols and are embedded into the ledge. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the
OTHERS begin to climb up the wall.

EXT . NABOO GRASS PLAINS DAY

The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR tries to run
from the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL CEEL : Retreat! Retreat!

The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in wagons.
JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to
unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the
wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the
balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS aren't so lucky. They get blasted by the
energy balls.
The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling
destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT -SPACE

ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A ship explodes
behind him (over his left shoulder).

ANAKIN : Whoo, boy! This is tense!

He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.

ANAKN : (Cont'd) : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!

ARTOO screams a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I've got control?

ANAKIN fips switches.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Okay, let's go left!

He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!

ARTOO beeps

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and
that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!

An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and
instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops! Whoa!

Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneauvers.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.

ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this
mess is the way we got into it.

ARTOO beeps a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one? This one?

ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the
enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The SQUADRON attacks the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo flight...go for the central bridge.
BRAVO TWO : ROger, Bravo Leader.

The attack is fruitless.

RIC OLIE : Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through
it.

Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks.

ANAKIN : I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!

The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it into a spin.
ARTOO screams.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We're hit!

ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!

ANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge
bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!

ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the
hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started!

ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.

ARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power
pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several
levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on
a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs
away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs
to catch up.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a
series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots
down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several
walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the
DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from
DARTH MAUL.
The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor.
OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open.
QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER
SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne roo.
Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns
around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping
them in the middle.
PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
CAPT. PANAKA : But we can't....
PADME : Captain, I said throw down your weapons.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to
EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart.OOM-9 sees
the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals
a retreat as the tanks enter the battle.
The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and
lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR signals JAR JAR to jump
off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings around trying to knock JAR JAR off.
JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps
onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are
everywhere. It is chaos.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the deadly
rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK
LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a
split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They
move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a
small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.
The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the
melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before
he hits the deadly electron field.
QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated
OBI-WAN watches.
DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes
his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON
slumps to the floor in a heap.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGANS have beeb overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE
DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and
DESTROYER DROIDS.
JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER OFFICERS.

JAR JAR : Dissa bad, berry bombad.
GENERAL CEEL : Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.

INT. THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE
DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.

NUTE : Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you
to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.

SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS.
Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.

SABE : I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!

NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the
TEN GUARDS in the room.

NUTE : After her! This one is a decoy!

SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE turns to
PADME.

NUTE : (Cont'd) Your Queen will not get away with this.

PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that
opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an
OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.
The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to
close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA
throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and
afraid.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
NUTE : Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before
hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD
attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI.
OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they
fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary.
DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting
pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH
MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the
endless shaft.
The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment,
OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing
DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH
down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death.
OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.

OBI-WAN : Master! Master!
QUI-GON : It is too late...It's...
OBI-WAN : No!
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!

QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding
the ship. He ducks back down.

ANAKIN : Uh oh. This is not good.

He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo.

The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot?

ARTOO beeps a reply.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot?

ARTOO whistles.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification!

ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.

ANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition.

He flips the switch and the engine starts.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we'll
blast you!
ANAKIN : Not if I can help it! Shields up!

ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE
DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by
ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them.

ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this!

He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed!

The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here!

ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.

TEY HOW : Sir, we're losing power... There is some problem with the main
reactor...
DOFINE : Impossible!! I don't...

The bridge explodes.

INT. NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE watches in amazement as the Federation battleship starts to
explode from the inside out.

BRAVO TWO : What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside.
RIC OLIE : I don't know, we didn't hit it.
BRAVO THREE : Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in
circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out to inspect the FROZEN
DROIDS. JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE DROIDS, and it falls over.

JAR JAR : Wierdind...

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN and ARTOO follow the squad of yellow Naboo starfighters into the
main hanger.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

RIC OLIE and the OTHER PILOTS gather around as thye exit their ships.

BRAVO TWO : He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted
the main reactor...
BRAVO THREE : Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy.

ANAKIN's ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo starfighters. RIC
OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and GROUND CREW rush to his ship.

RIC OLIE : We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship?

ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the PILOTS stare in
amazement.

ANAKIN : I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?

ARTOO beeps. oh. oh.

INT. MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY

The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard
of the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and
RUNE HAAKO. OBI-WAN, the QUEEN, and her HANDMAIDENS stand before the
NEIMOIDIANS.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and
explain all this.
CAPT. PANAKA : I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.

The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead
the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship. The GRAND CHANCELLOR
PALPATINE and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS descend the walkway, followed by YODA
and SEVERAL OTHER JEDI MASTERS.

The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : Congratulations on youer election, Chancellor. It is so good to
see you again.
PALPATINE : It's good to be home. Your boldness has saved our people, Your
Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring
peace and prosperity to the Republic.

OBI-WAN greets YODA and the OTHER JEDI as CAPTAIN PANAKA takes the
NEIMODIANS onto the cruiser.

INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY

The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not
quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of
the room.

YODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree
on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
OBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in
his training.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without
the approval of the Council if I must.
YODA : Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree, the
council does. Your apprentice, young Skywalker will be.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - FUNERAL TEMPLE STEPS - SUNSET

QUI-GON's body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the QUEEN, SIO
BIBBLE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NABOO
TROOPES, TWENTY OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-WAN (standing with ANAKIN), JAR
JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum
roll that stops. Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to
OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : He is one with the Force, Anakin...You must let go.
ANAKIN : What will happen to me now?
OBI-WAN : I am your Master now. You will become a Jedi, I promise.

To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.

MACE WINDU : There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
YODA : Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an
apprentice.
MACE WINDU : But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?

They give each other a concerned look.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

				JOHNNY
		Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.

	But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch
	a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.

				RASCZAK
		Here in History and Moral Philosophy

	Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump

		It's a reward... what the Federation gives you

	Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.

		No. Something given has no value !

				RASCZAK
		When you vote, you're exercising political

		Gee, we always thought you were the

		In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's 
		exerted by ten or ten billion, political 
		authority is violence by degree. The 
		people we call citizens have earned
		the right to wield it.

	DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.

				DIZZY
		My mother always says that violence
		never solves anything.

				RASCZAK
		Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of
		Hiroshima would have to say about that.
		You.

	Rasczak points at Carmen.

				CARMEN
		They probably wouldn't say anything.
		Hiroshima was destroyed.

	Johnny presses ´"SEND" on his desk, and the cartoon appears
	across the way on Carmen's screen.

				RASCZAK
		Correct. Naked force has settled more
		issues in history than any other factor.
		The contrary opinion 'violence never
		solves anything' is wishful thinking
		at its worst.

	While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful
	smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.

				RASCZAK
		People who forget that always pay...
		They pay with their lives and their
		freedom.

	Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.
	So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump,
	snaps Johnny to.

				RASCZAK
		You. Tell me the moral difference,
		if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?

				JOHNNY
		The difference lies in the field of civic
		virtue. A citizen accepts personal
		responsibility for the safety of the body politic,
		of which he is a member, defending it,
		if need be, with his life.
		The civilian does not.

				RASCZAK
		The exact words of the text. But do
		you understand it ?
		Do you believe it ?

				JOHNNY
		Uh, I don't know.

				RASCZAK
		Of course you don't. I doubt if any 
		of you here would recognize 'civic virtue'
		if it bit you in the ass.

	A bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.

				RASCZAK
		Well, that's it. Have a nice life.

7	EXT	NEW UNI HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	walk with their friends. Several COUPLES hold hands. Johnny
	tries to take Carmen's hand, but she demurs. Johnny broods.

				CARMEN
		C'mon, let's see if they've posted the
		math final test yet.

				STUDENT
		Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ?

				JOHNNY
		How should I know ?

				STUDENT
		You're captain of the team !

8	EXT	QUAD - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	join other students around a MULTI-SCREEN KIOSK.

				CARMEN
		First thing Fleet Academy looks at
		is your math scores. 
		Wish me luck !

	Carmen enters her name, receives her score:	97% !	She beams.

				JOHNNY
		Good for you.

				CARMEN
		Your turn...

	Then she spots Carl across the way talking with MARCO, 17.

				CARMEN
		Hold on... I wanna talk to Marco.
		His sister's at Fleet !

	Carmen rushes off. Johnny checks his score:	35% ! Crushed, he
	makes sure no none else has seen. Carl walks up to him.

				CARL
		You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.

				JOHNNY
		What's the hurry ?

				CARL
		Others are waiting.

	Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends.

				JOHNNY
		Did you read her mind ?

				CARL
		Don't have to... Some mating semaphore
		is pretty hard to miss.

	It's true. You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny.

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, but I want Carmen.

				CARL
		You got it bad.

	Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off.

				CARL
		Don't forget about this afternoon.
			(to Carmen)
		He's always late when he walks you home
		to fish for a kiss.

	Carmen blushes, covers.
	
				CARMEN
		She's flying starships !

				JOHNNY
		Who ?

				CARMEN
		Marco's sister. Can you imagine 
		maneuvering half a million tons through
		crwoded space lanes...
		You gotta have nerves of steel !
		Reflexes are critical

				JOHNNY
		I have good reflexes.

	Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't
	like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm.

				CARMEN
		C'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology.

9	INT	BIOLOGY LAB  -- DAY - THE BIOLOGY TEACHER

	is an older woman, very spry, also blind. Johnny, Carmen and
	other students gather around covered lab tables.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		For our final today, please identify the mouthparts,
		the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the
		nerve cord and count the ganglia.
		You may begin.

	The students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60
	centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES laid out for dissection.

				CARMEN
		Eeuch !

				JOHNNY
		Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are
		Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't 
		true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many
		ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself
		in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and
		mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of 
		society.

				JOHNNY
		Better put your goggles on.

	Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green
	fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have
		identified over two billion species so far.
		Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.

				CARMEN
		But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented
		art, mathematics and interstellar travel.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		True, we know of no insect society that has
		produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a
		Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your
		head, take the example of the Arachnids, a 
		highly organized, highly evolved insect society.

	She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a
	common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR.

				BIOLOGY TEACHER
		They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers
		have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the 
		Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years
		of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the 
		biological means to hurl their spore into space.

	Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity 
	open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out.

				JOHNNY
		Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric
		caecal...

				CARMEN
		Excuse me...!

	She heads for the door, hand over her mouth.

10	EXT	CIVIC PARK - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	walk home from school together.

				JOHNNY
		35% on the math final !  No one could be
		that dumb with numbers.

				CARMEN
		Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch
		over a bug. How embarassing.

				JOHNNY
		Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere
		if you don't know math.

				CARMEN
		Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are
		dumb with numbers.

				JOHNNY
		Then how come you won't hold hands with me
		at school ?

				CARMEN
		I don't want everyone to see.

				JOHNNY
		Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?

				CARMEN
		How come that's all you talk about anymore ?

				JOHNNY
		It's all I think about anymore.

	Indeed, they are all alone now. The look in Johnny's eye says how
	about it. Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand.

11	EXT	PUPLIC TRANSPORTATION - DAY - CARMEN

	and Johnny stand together near a bank of TRANSPORTERS.

				CARMEN
		You can't walk me home.

				JOHNNY
		Why not ?

				CARMEN
		I thought you were going to help Carl.

				JOHNNY
		Carl can wait.

				CARMEN
		Johnny, my Dad's home today.

	Johnny's face darkens with frustration.

				JOHNNY
		What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm
		a teenager. You can't be a citizen when
		you're only a teenager !

				CARMEN
		It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich
		they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff
		means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.

				JOHNNY
		Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come
		we're such good friends ?

				CARMEN
		Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?

	Carmen steps into the flux.	ZAPPP!	She's gone.
	Johnny grins, happy to be in love.

12	INT	CARL'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY - JOHNNY

	is hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's 
	basement workshop. Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card,
	the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.

				CARL
		Don't think about it... go on instinct.

				JOHNNY
		Ace of spades.

	The ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates "no match".
	Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds.

				CARL
		Statistically speaking you should've accidentally
guessed right by know.

				JOHNNY
		In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves 
		I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.

	Wrong again.

				CARL
		Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why 
		some people are sensitive and some aren't.
		Federal studies like this might provide a clue.

	The next card up is the nine of clubs.

				JOHNNY
		I wouldn't want to know what everyone was
		thinking. Four of spades.

	Suddenly, A GIANT YELLOW FROG jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing
	the monitor. Johnny removes the blindfold.

				CARL
		Cyrano, you big yellow turd !

	Johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck.

				JOHNNY
		He just wants attention. You don't play with 
		him like you used to.

	Carl concentrates for a moment.

				CARL
		Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

	Cyrano's eyes widen. He hops off the table and up the stairs two at
	a time. Carl clears the screen.

				JOHNNY
		How do you make him do that ?

				CARL
		I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling
		up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.

	From upstairs, CARL'S MOM shrieks.

				MOM (O.S.)
		Get out ! Get out ! CARL...!

				JOHNNY
		Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that
		to me.

				CARL
		Don't be afraid. Can't do humans... yet.
		C'mon let's go.

	Carl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all.

				JOHNNY
		Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for
		Starside R&D ?

				CARL
		Passport to the Universe.
		Who wouldn't want that ?

				JOHNNY
		I've been thinking about applying for 
		Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.

				CARL
		Your father will never let you.

				JOHNNY
		I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd 
		make a pretty good pilot. I've good great
		reflexes. You need that for maneuvering,
		you know.

				CARL
		Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through
		stellar navigation.
		So what do you think your chances are ?

				JOHNNY
		Eight point... no, uh, seven...

				CARL
		If you can't do those numbers, you haven't
		got a chance.

				JOHNNY
		All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, 
		and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.

				CARL
		Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. 
		Now try and pay attention.

	Carl puts a card up.

				JOHNNY
		Queen of hearts.

	The computer indicates a match. Johnny peers around at the monitor.
	It is the Queen of hearts.

				CARL
		Well, what do you know about that !

13	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - STANDS - DAY - CARMEN

	and other students wearing orange and black sing the "Uni High Song".
	The SCOREBOARD says:	REGIONAL FINAL.
	Across the field, fans wear red and gold and sing another song.

14	INT	LOCKER ROOM - DAY - JOHNNY

	and other UNI HIGH TIGERS, all exceptionally robust young man and women,
	suit up in their orange and black uniforms.

				DIZZY
		Tesla's tough. They tumble good and they
		hit HARD.

	Dizzy bounces a JUMP SHOE to Johnny. The spring fires and vaults it high into
	the air. Johnny catches it, puts it on, smiles cocky at the TESLA GIANTS who
	suit up in red and gold.

				JOHNNY
		We tumble good, too.

15	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - WHAM ! -- TIGERS AND GIANTS 	

collide. Powered by jump shoes, the play is gymnastic. Johnny moves the ball ,
flips high in the air over the Giant defensive line, makes ten meters before he is
brought down.

16	EXT	STANDS - DAY - THE CROWD

	cheers as Johnny runs back to join his team. He sees Carmen waving, glad that
	Johnny has seen her among all the people.

17	EXT	HUDDLE - DAY - JOHNNY
	
	and other Tigers listen as quarterback Dizzy calls the plays.

				DIZZY
		Kick three, fade left. On two.

	They make fists, then breal for thevline of scrimmage.

18	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY - THE TIGERS
	
	have the ball. The Giant's QUARTERBACKassigns ZANDER BARCALOW, 18,
	handsome, super-confident, to guard Johnny.

				ZANDER
		Time's running out.

	Zander points. The SCOREBOARD shows	TIGERS 19,	GIANTS 20,
	three minutes and counting on the clock. Johnny grins.

				JOHNNY
		A lot can happen in three minutes.

				DIZZY
		Hut... hut !

	Johnny takes the handoff, flips over a gauntlet of Giant guards. Zander
	hurls himself at Johnny, misses. Johnny scores.
	Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe.

19	EXT	SIDELINES - DAY-ZANDER

	looks up and sees Carmen, smiling as she offers him a hand. She helps
	him up. He holds her hand longer than necessary.

				CARMEN
		Are you alright ?

				ZANDER
		I'm getting better.

20	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - JOHNNY

	runs back to join his team as the crowd cheers. The Tigers lead 
	21-20. Johnny frowns when he sees Carmen talking to Zander on 
	the sidelines, shaking his head, smiling.

21	EXT	SIDELINE - DAY - ZANDER

	finds his shoe, straps it on.

				ZANDER
		So what are you doing later ?

				CARMEN
		Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?

				ZANDER
		I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian.
		I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

	Zander heads for the field. Carmen follows, interested.

				CARMEN
		You're going to the Academy ?
		That's where I want to go. I'd love
		to talk to you abou that.

	A REFEREE blows his whistle at Zander, signalling impatiently.

				ZANDER
		I'm all ears.

				CARMEN
		Don't you have to finish the game ?

22	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE - DAY-THE GIANTS

	are in possession. Zander lands hard in front of Johnny.

				JOHNNY
		Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.

				ZANDER
		You can never be sure.

	Johnny scowls at Zander, turns his head to look back at Carmen.
	She waves, smiling. The Giants pull ablitz.

				DIZZY
		WATCH THE BLITZ...!

	Zander knocks Johnny on his ass, and the Giants score. It's
	TIGERS 21, GIANTS 22 and less than a minute to go.

23	EXT	HUDDLE -- DAY -- DIZZY

	orders up the next play. Johnny keeps looking over his shoulder
	because Zander's back talking to Carmen again.

				DIZZY
		Flip six, three hole. Rico ?
		Hey !

	Dizzy slams Johnny upside his helmet with her forearm.

				JOHNNY
		What ?

				DIZZY
		You were drifting. Flip six, three hole.
		On one, got it ?

				JOHNNY
		Just throw me the ball, Diz.

	They make fists and break.

24	EXT	SCRIMMAGE LINE -- DAY -- JOHNNY

	takes position again across the line from Zander who now grins at
	Johnny broadly. Johnny  doesn't grin back. 

				DIZZY
		Hut !

	At the snap, Johnny breaks for open field. Dizzy throws, Johnny catches
	it, trips Zander up painfully, and hurls himself into the end zone as a
	horn sounds the game's finish.

25	EXT	ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - CHEERING UNI FANS

	rush onto the field as the school band strikes up a victory march.
	Tigers do flips in the air. Giants look dejected. 
	Zander picks himself up, watches Johnny leave with Carmen.

26	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - JOHNNY

	walks throuh rooms filled with elegant furniture. He's all spiffed up
	for the big dance. His MOTHER catches him preening in front of a
	mirror by the TRANSPORTER in the hall.

				MOTHER
		Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time
		I checked you were only five years old. You had
		such a bright little face...

				JOHNNY
		Aw, don't get mushy.

	Johnny's FATHER enters carrying a FEDERAL SERVICE CATALOGUE.

				FATHER
		This came for you today. I presume on your
		request.

				JOHNNY
		A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...

				MOTHER
		You aren't thinking of applying...?

	Johnny shrugs.

				FATHER
		Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather
		take ten lashes in Public Square than see you
		ruin your life.

				JOHNNY
		It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to
		get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a
		couple of years.

				MOTHER
		Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in
		the Federal Service. If something happened 
		to you I don't know what I would do...

				FATHER
		Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher.
		What's his name ? You know the one I
		mean.

				JOHNNY
		Mr. Rasczak.

				FATHER
		Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be
		a law against using a school as a 
		recruiting station !

				JOHNNY
		No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all.
		He sorta discourages you really.

				FATHER
		Good, because you're going to Harvard,
		and that's the end of it.

				JOHNNY
		I'm eighteen. It's my decision.

				FATHER
Oh, is that how it is ?

				MOTHER
		Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise
		for you that will settle this.
		Can you guess what it is ?

				JOHNNY
		Uh, no.

				FATHER
		A trip to the Outer Rings.
		Whad'ya think of that ?

				JOHNNY
		Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've
		always wanted to go there.

				MOTHER		
		Good good, then it's all settled.

				FATHER
		A year at Harvard and you'll  see this
		"Federal Service" is just menial training 
		for inferior people so they can call 
		themselves "citizens" and take airs for 
		the rest of their lives.

				JOHNNY
		Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal
		and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest 
		kid at school !

				FATHER
		Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...

	Johnny puts on his jacket.

				JOHNNY
		I don't know what they teach at Harvard,
		but I think I'm pretty good enough the
		way I am !
	
				MOTHER
		Johnny, please. Calm yourself.

				JOHNNY
		Well, that's what you're saying ! You're
		saying that I'm not good enough the way
		I am now !

	Johnny stomps out, the transporter goes ZAPPP !

				MOTHER
		Why did you go and do that ? He was all
		ready to go Zegema Beach !

				FATHER
		Teenagers !

27	INT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - EVERYONE

	at the "Farewell Dance" is dressed up. Rasczak and other TEACHERS
	chaperon. A spotlight finds the BAND LEADER.

				BAND LEADER
		Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so
		let's turn down the lights and make it a
		slow one.

	The lights go down. Dizzy, dressed pretty, brightens when she sees Johnny
	standing alone near the dance floor.

				DIZZY
		Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?

				JOHNNY
		Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

				DIZZY
		Too bad for her if she's not around.

	Dizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close.

				DIZZY
		You know, it's sad... Most of us probably
		won't see each other again after tonight.
	
	There is an invitation here. Johnny doesn't take it.

				JOHNNY
		You still gonna play for Brazil ?

				DIZZY
		Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

				JOHNNY
		Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

				DIZZY
		How come we never got together ?

	Dizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully. He's distracted. Carmen crosses
	the room, stunning in her formal.

				JOHNNY
		Can't we just be friends, Diz ?

				DIZZY
		Sure.

				JOHNNY
		Uh, look, Diz...

				DIZZY
		Guess you gotta go.

				JOHNNY
		You're the best.

	Johnny heads for Carmen. Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes 
	his hand. She looks around for someone to dance with.
	Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly.

28	INT	GYMNASIUM - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT - CARMEN AND JOHNNY

	dance. Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids.

				JOHNNY
		Isn't it great to be in love ?

				CARMEN
		How do I know if this is love ?
	
				JOHNNY
		It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...

				CARL
		Outa the way you two !

	Carl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer.
	Johnny goes in for the kiss again.

				CARMEN
		Romance is just a vestigial biological
		response to procreation...

				JOHNNY
		Aw, you're in love with me... 
		You just dont know it yet.

	Johnny's confidence makes her smile. Johnny moves in to kiss her,
	but the music ends. Everyone applauds. The lights come up and 
	people head for the doors. Johnny sees Rasczak.

				JOHNNY
		Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.

				CARMEN
		I'll meet you outside.

	Johnny heads over to Rasczak.

				JOHNNY
		Mister Rasczak ?

				RASCZAK
		What is it, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History
		and Moral Philosophy was the best class
		I had this year.

				RASCZAK
			(smiling)
		Well, it's not really my job to please.
		Hope you learned something.

				JOHNNY
		I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I
		have what it take to be a citizen.

				RASCZAK
		Good for you. Go find out.

				JOHNNY
		Well, my parents are against it, and I 
		know it's my choice, but I was
		wondering...
		What would you do if you were me ?

				RASCZAK
		Figuring things out for yourself is the
		only freedom anyone really has.
		Use that freedom.
		Make your own choice, Rico.

29	EXT	UNI HIGH GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - JOHNNY
	
	walks out and finds Carmen talking with Zander. He wears the blue 
	uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee. Carmen examines his FLEET PIN,
	a pair of silver wings.

				CARMEN
		Johnny, this is Zander.

				ZANDER
		Yeah, we know each other from the game. 
		No hard feeling, eh, chum ?

				JOHNNY
		None at all... We won.

				CARMEN
		Good luck at the academy.

	Zander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic.

				ZANDER
		Always.

30	EXT	PROMENADE - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	walk together along the river holding hands.

				CARMEN
		He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy.
		Isn't that great ?

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, sure, I guess.

				CARMEN
		No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a
		chance.

				JOHNNY
		What are you talking about ? We both know
		you're gonna be a pilot.

				CARMEN
		Zander is going for pilot, too.

				JOHNNY
		You two have so much in common.

	Carmen pulls Johnny to a stop, looks him in the eye.

				CARMEN
		Johnny Rico, you're jealous !

				JOHNNY
		I can't help it.

				CARMEN
		He's nothing like you.

				JOHNNY
		I don't even know if you're my girl.

	Carmen smiles, leans in close to Johnny.
			
				CARMEN
		Are you the boy for me ?

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign
		up for Federal Service.

	They kiss, tentatively, but the passion grows and they break apart,
	breathless.

				CARMEN
		Oh, Johnny...

31	EXT	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	making out as they wait their turn. There are a few other people around
	including a POLICEMAN.

				CARMEN
		Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...

				JOHNNY
		Who cares ?

				CARMEN
		You're right. Let's never stop...

				POLICEMAN
		Hey, you, there's a place for that !

	Without stopping, Johnny pulls Carmen into the flux.	ZAPPP !

32	INT	FEDERAL HOUSING - NIGHT - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	kissing at her front door. Johnny moves his hand tenatively to Carmen 's breast.
	She takes his hand, smiling, puts it under her shirt.

				JOHNNY
		I love you, Carmen.

				CARMEN
		Shhh...

	She puts her mouth on his and they melt together. The door flies open,
	and CARMEN'S DAD stands there.

				CARMEN'S DAD
		Carmen, it's late. Get inside.

				CARMEN
		Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny.

	Carmen ducks inside. Her father looks Johnny over. He carries a terrible
	battle scar oon his face.

				CARMEN'S DAD
		I don't want you around Carmen anymore. Get me ?

				JOHNNY
		Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from
		now on, Mr. Ibanez.

	Carmen's Dad reddens. He'd like to punch Johnny out.
 
				CARMEN'S DAD
		Carmen's gonna be a citizen. She don't need you
		and your rich family. The Federation'll give her
		everything she needs.

				CARMEN (O.S.)
		Dad, leave him alone...
	
	Carmen's Dad slams the door in Johnny's face.

33	EXT	FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

34	INT	LOBBY - DAY - THE RECRUITING SERGEANT

	is missing one arm. He smiles broadly at the three teenagers.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Fresh meat for the grinder, eh ?

				CARL
		That's us. Where do we sign ?

	He turns in his chair to grab the forms. Johnny and his friends see that he is also
	missing both legs. The Recruiting Sergeant catches them looking, 
	smiles even wider.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Here and here and here.

	As he signs, Johnny looks at the campaign ribbons on the Recruiting Sergeant's
	chest. We hear MUSIC: 	"The Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays softly in honor
	of distant battles.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service.
		Follow the blue line.

35	INT	PROCESSING HALL - DAY - JOHNNY, CARMEN AND CARL

	are routed into different lines, joining other hopeful civilians.
	A COLONEL makes a speech over the loudspeaker.

	and others in the line strip down. The guy in front of Johnny is
	DON, 18, athletic and cheerful.

				DON
		They took my sister, they'll take anybody.

37	INT	TESTING FACILITY -- DAY -- JOHNNY

	grimaces as a TECHNICIAN installs an INTERFACE PLATE on 
	his side, drawing fluids.

				DON
		Oh, this is the part that hurts !

	A PSYCH OFFICER sits down across from each candidate.

				PSYCH OFFICER
		No talking please. I'm going to ask you some 
		questions. Please answer all questions truthfully.
		We'll know if you don't.
		Birthplace ?

				JOHNNY
		Here in Buenos Aires.

	The Psych Officer checks Johnny's response on a meter.

38	INT	VARIOUS TESTING STATIONS - DAY - JOHNNY

	is poked and prodded, subjected to aural, visual and pharmacological
	stimuli, and scanned from head to toe.

				PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)
		Are your parents currently citizens ?

		No, sir.

				PSYCH OFFICER (V.O.)

39	INT	DEBRIEF - DAY - JOHNNY

	sits across from a MAJOR who views a list on a monitor Johnny can't see.

				MAJOR
		I'm happy to tell you that you've been
		accepted for Federal Service.

				JOHNNY
		Wow, that's great.

				MAJOR
		Looks like you're quite an athlete.
		Boy, look at those reaction stats.

	The Major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list:
	MOBILE INFANTERY.

				MAJOR
		My job is to dertermine what you're
		best suited for.

				JOHNNY
		I want to be a pilot, sir.

				MAJOR
		Sorry, son, no way. Your school records
		say you don't have the math skills.

	Johnny swallows this. He knew it was coming. The Major deletes
	"Pilot" from the list, then several other items.

				MAJOR
		That rules out the scientific and engineering
		applications, and I'm afraid we reserve
		non-military options for candidates who are
		frankly less able-bodied than you are, son...

	He turns the monitor around and shows Johnny the list.
	The only thing left is MOBILE INFANTERY.

				MAJOR
		It looks like the only thing you're good
		for is cannon fodder.
		I'm putting you down for the
		Mobile Infantery.

40	INT	AUDITORIUM - DAY - CARMEN

	proudly takes the Federal Service oath with about twenty-five other people,

				CARMEN
		I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?

				JOHNNY
		Naw, I made it, Carl made it.

	Just then, Don rushes past, shamefaced, crying.

				JOHNNY
		He was in the group with me.
		I guess he didn't...

				CARMEN
		Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.

	The Recruiting Sergeant is getting ready to go home. He's got legs now,
	and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on.
	He grins when he sees them staring.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted,
		but at the end of the day I go home.
		How'd you kids do ?

				CARMEN
		I'm gonna go for pilot.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Good for you. We need every pilot we can get.

	Johnny holds the door for Carmen and the Recruiting Sergeant. 
	Suddenly Carl appears looking a little paler than usual.

				CARMEN
		Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?

				JOHNNY
		Did you get Starside R&D ?

				CARL
		No.

42	EXT	FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	are stunned.

				JOHNNY
		I don't believe it !

				CARL
		I got Games & Theory.

	Well, everyone's a little impressed by this.

				CARMEN
		Games & Theory ? That's Military
		Intelligence... Oh, Carl !

				JOHNNY
		Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Next time we meet, I'll probably have to salute
		you. What about you, son ?

				JOHNNY
		Infantery, sir.

	The Recruiting Sergeant beams, offers a prosthetic hand.

				RECRUITING SERGEANT
		Well, good for you. The Mobile Infantery made me
		the man I am today.

	Just what Johnny wanted to hear. They watch the old Sergeant walk
	away.	MUSIC:	"The Mobile Infantery Theme".
	Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the arm as they walk.

				CARMEN
		Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always
		be friends no matter what.

				JOHNNY
		I'll go for that.

				CARL
		Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away
		from each other, and chances are we'll never see
		each other again, but sure...

				CARMEN
		I can't wait to tell my Dad I'm in.
		He's gonna be so happy !

43	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - JOHNNY

	stands sullenly as his Father rages at him.

				FATHER
		You'll resign, and that's all there is to it.
		It might look bad, but if that's the worst
		you suffer...

				JOHNNY
		I won't quit !

				FATHER
		I'm telling you, you will !
		You're not going back. You're going
		to go on vacation !

				JOHNNY
		I'm not going on vacation ! I want to
		be acitizen ! It's my decision. 
		I made it.

	Johnny turns for the door. His father throws his last shot.

				FATHER
		You walk out that door, you're cut off,
		young man... You understand me ?
		Alright, THAT'S IT, YOU'RE...

44	INT	JOHNNY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT--JOHNNY

	walks out, grim, sees his mother, tears in her eyes.

				FATHER (O.S.)
		...CUT OFF !

				MOTHER
		Johnny, why won't you change your mind ?
		Does citizenship mean so much to you ?

				JOHNNY
		Well, yeah, sure...

				MOTHER
		I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life
		over some silly little girl who wants to look 
		handsome in a uniform.

	Johnny's face reddens.

				JOHNNY
		Don't talk about my girl that way.

	Johnny turns on his heel, heads for the transporter.		ZAPPP !

45	EXT	FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION HUB - DAY - JOHNNY

	looks for Carmen among hundreds of young people bound for 
	Federal Service destinations. Recruits wear civilian clothes.
	Everyone else is in uniform.  
	
				P.A. (O.S.)
		Outbound group 1380, Ursa Minor

	Now he sees her entering struggling with luggage. Johnny rushes to
	help her and soon he is carrying all her bags.

				JOHNNY
		You're late.

				CARMEN
		My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly
		he's afraid he's never gonna see me 
		again or something. It was sweet, but it
		took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready
		to go.

	At the freight station, Carmen enters her Federal I.D. card and gets
	numbered tags for her bags.

				JOHNNY
		Me, too. I'm wearing everything I own.

	Johnny loads them onto a conveyor belt.

				CARMEN
		Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.

				JOHNNY
		Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything
		I need for the next two years, right ?
	
	Carmen's already moved to the next line. Johnny follows.

				CARMEN
		You talk to Carl ?

				JOHNNY
		He left this morning. He couldn't say where.

	Carmen logs in, enters her destination:	LUNA - TERESHKOVA
	FLEET ACADEMY.	The tickets station spits out a pass.

				CARMEN
		It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it.
		Going someplace new where you don't
know anyone.

	Carmen heads toward a bank of transporters. Johnny stops her,
	takes her by the arms.

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna miss you.

				CARMEN
		I'll miss you, too, Johnny.

				JOHNNY
		I love you.

				P.A. (O.S.)
		Outbound group 948A, Tereshkova,

		Oh, that's me.
	
	She scans her pass, but Johnny stops her again.

				JOHNNY
		Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.

				CARMEN
		Alright, I love you.

	Carmen kisses him, jumps into the transporter.

				JOHNNY
		Do you mean it ?

	is 40, astoundingly fit, and like all drill instructors, he carries a small baton.
	He addresses sixty shorn RECRUITS.

				ZIM
		The problem with you is that none of you are
		good enough the way you are. 

	Johnny stands in formation with his squad, among them:

	BRECKINRIDGE, 18, DJANA'D, 19, KATRINA McINTIRE, 18, ACE LEVY, 
	18, SHUJUMI, 18, and KITTEN SMITH, 18.
		 	 
				ZIM
		I am your senior drill instructor,
		Career Sergeant Zim.
			(then)
		TO THINK THIS HAD TO HAPPEN TO
		ME ! What a bunch of apes. No, strike that.
		You don't rate that good...you sunken-chested,
		slack-bellied, drooling refugees from apron
		strings ! In my whole life I've never seen such
		a disgraceful huddle of momma's spoiled
		little darlings ! Suck in those guts !
		You there, EYES FRONT !

	Zim gives Kitten Smith the hairy eyeball. Smith cracks up.

				ZIM
		Do you think I'm funny ? Do I make
		you laugh ? Do you think I'm a
		comedian ?

	Kitten Smith shake his head  "no" , but he can't stifle himself.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Sorry...!

				ZIM
		The first and last words out of your
		stinking holes will be "sir".
		Do you get me ?

				KITTEN SMITH
		Sir, sorry...sir.

				ZIM
		See the armory ? Run around it !

	Kitten Smith squints. Out in the distance, a tiny building.
	Zim smacks him on the leg with his baton.

				KITTEN SMITH
		YEOW !

				ZIM
		RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace !

	Kitten Smith runs. Big CORPORAL BRONSKI, 28, takes out after
	him, laying a baton across his backside every time he slows.

				ZIM
		You are now all brothers and sisters in
		the same family, my family, the Mobile
		Infantery. I will be your mother.
		I will be your father. If you do not 
		please me I will throw you out of my
		family because I hate all slackers and 
		negative hackers.
		Do you get me ?

				JOHNNY ET AL
		Sir, yes, sir !

	Zim points at the little WHITE PICKET FENCE leading to a
	transporter near the front gate.

				ZIM
		Anytime you think I'm being to tough,
		anytime you think I'm being unfair...
		QUIT ! Grab your gear and take a
		stroll down "Washout Lane". 
		Get me ?

				JOHNNY ET AL
		Sir, yes, sir !

				ZIM
		I wonder if there's a handful of
		guts in the whole bunch. Who
		thinks they've got what it takes
		to knock me down ?

	Breckinridge, a big guy from a farm planet, steps forward.

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Sir, I guess maybe I do, sir.

	Zim crooks afinger at him. Breckinridge charges. Zim knocks
	him flat. Breckinridge holds his arm, twisted now.

				ZIM
		You alright, Breckinridge ?

			BRECKINRIDGE
		Sir, yes, sir. It's my arm. I think it's
		broken, sir.

				ZIM
		MEDIC !

	A MEDIC charges up, checks Breckinridge's arm, grins.

				MEDIC
		Clean break... Doc'll have him back on
		active duty by tomorrow.

				ZIM
		Good. Who's next ?

	Shujumi steps up, assumes a fighting stance. Zim looks him over.
	There's not not much to him. Shujumi attacks Zim, counters his 
	counter, dances out of range.

				DJANA'D
		Lookit the little guy go !

	Now Zim attacks. Shujumi flip kicks Zim in the head.

				JOHNNY
		He's good alright.

				KATRINA
		I'll bet he makes squad leader.

				ACE
		He'll have to get past me.

	The recruits check Ace out. Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a
	knee in the little man's throat. Shujumi passes out.

				ZIM
		MEDIC !

51	EXT	OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITES

	tumble a brutal obstacle course using JUMP BOOTS.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		Some of you may not ´make it.

	Djana'd hits a tower and falls to the deck hard, dropping her rifle.
	She holds her knee, hurt. Zim races over to her.

				ZIM
		WHY IS THAT WEAPON ON THE GROUND ?
		YOUR WEAPON IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
		YOU ARE ! PICK IT UP ! PICK IT UP !

	Zim begins to kick her because she doesn't move fast enough.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		You might think I am unfair.

52	EXT	ZERO GRAVITY COMBAT - DAY - THE RECRUITES

	watch poor Kitten Smith spar with Zim. Kitten Smith whacks Zim across the jaw.
	Zim doesn't even flinch.

				ZIM
		Is that all you got ? You hit like kitten, Smith !
		This is a punch.

	WHAM !	Zim knocks Kitten Smith for a loop.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		You will not like me.

53	INT	HYPERPHYSICAL TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS - DAY - ZIM

	and in a third, screeching ARACHNID WARRIORS.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		But if you survive you will thank me
		because you will be born again hard.
		You will be a new person.
		You will be a Cap Trooper. And then,
		MAYBE, you'll  be good enough...

54	EXT	COMBAT KNIFE PRACTICE - DAY - ZIM

	throws a knife, buries the point in a narrow post.

				ZIM (V.O.)
		...to serve in my family.

				ACE
		Sir, I don't understands who needs a
		knife in a nuke fight anyway...
		All you gotta do is push a button, sir !

	Zim yanks the knife out of the post.

				ZIM
		Put your hand on the post, private.

	Ace obeys. Zim throws, sticks his hand to the post.

				ACE
		AWK !

				ZIM
		The enemy cannot push a button if you
		disable his hand. MEDIC !

	Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post. A
	recruit trots up. Johnny stares, surprised. It's Dizzy.

				DIZZY
		Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty , sir.

	She snaps Zim a salute and hands him her orders.

				ZIM
		I see you specifically requested transfer
		from Fort Cronkite to this training group...

	Dizzy grins self-consciously at Johnny.

				DIZZY
		Sir, I heard it was the best, sir !

				ZIM
		It is the best... BUT WHAT MAKES YOU 
THINK YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH ?
ON YOUR BELLY AND GIVE ME 
FIFTY, RECRUIT !

	Dizzy hits the deck and starts doing push-ups, counting off as
	MEDICS arrive and go to work on Ace's hand.

55	INT	MESS HALL - DAY - THE RECRUITES

	line up for mess piled four-square together on a single plate,
	meat on the bottom, ice cream on top.

		Improper Attitude ! They'll kick you out
		for talking like that...

				DJANA'D
		They can kick you out for anything.
		Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory 
		Performance...

				KITTEN SMITH
		Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye !

	Ace cuts into the front off the mess line.

				ACE
		Aw, you either got what it takes
		or you don't.

				DJANA'D
		C'mon Ace, wait your turn !

				ACE
		At ease, soldier. It's all the same muck.

				JOHNNY
		Better get in line like everyone else, Ace.

	Silence. There could be a fight. Zim, standing nearby, watches
	with interest. Ace opens his hand.

				ACE
		You got some guts for a rich kid.
		I guess you and me could be buddies.

				JOHNNY
		What an honor...

				ACE
		Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have
		a friend like me !

	Ace makes a big friendly show of trading places with Johnny.

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Come on, Ace, back off the line !
		Bacl off the line !

	Now everyone's laughing, pushing Ace to the back of the line.
	Johnny has his grub. Dizzy comes up with her tray.

				DIZZY
		Hey, amigo, come chow with me.

				JOHNNY
		No thanks, Diz.

				DIZZY
		What's your malfunction, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		You are. I joined up to get out on my
		own. And you had to tag along.

				DIZZY
		What ? You think I joined the Mobile
		Infantery because of you ?

				JOHNNY
		You saying you didn't ?

	Johnny turns away. Dizzy watches him go, hurt.

56	EXT	OBSTACLE COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	tumble down the difficult course in their power suits. At the head of
	the pack , breathing hard, Johnny and Ace race.

				ACE
		What makes you think... you'll make...
		squad leader, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		Something... I've got...you don't.

				ACE
		You rich kids... are all the same !

				JOHNNY
		It isn't about rich... It's about
		who's best...!

	They come to a trap, prepare to leap.

				DIZZY
		Coming through !

	Dizzy jumps over them from behind. Johnny and Ace tumble into the mud.
	They watch, chagrined, as Dizzy reaches the end of the course effortlessly.

				ZIM
		C'mon, move it, you apes !

57	INT	SHOWERS - NIGHT - DIZZY

	enters as the recruits scrub down.

				KITTEN SMITH
		We all have one thing in common. We were 
		all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile
		Infanterie. What's your excuse,
		Breckinridge ?

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Well, my family is all farmers. I hate farming.
		Mobile Infantery's pure picnic by comparison.

				KITTEN SMITH
		So the grow 'em big and dumb on the farm
		planet, eh ?	Djana'd ?

				DJANA'D
		I'm going in for politics. You gotta be a
		citizen for that. So here I am.

				KITTEN SMITH
		C'mon, keep it going... Katrina !

				KATRINA
		I wanna be a mom. It's easier to get
		a licence if you've served.

				ACE
		I'm going career... officer's training.
		That's why I wanna be squad leader.
		They look for that.

				JOHNNY
		Wanting it doesn't make you the best
		one for the job.

				ACE
		Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here
		with the chops to lead.

				JOHNNY
		Well, maybe you better look again.

				SHUJUMI
		Federation's gonna give me a scholarship
		when my hitch is up. I wanna be a
		neurologist, study brain chemisty and
		associated stimulus...

	Dizzy dresses down. Johnny and all the other guys check her out.
	She has a fabulous body. Dizzy cathes Johnny looking. He turns
	his back as she steps into the shower next to him.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Your turn, Rico !

				JOHNNY
		Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ?

				KITTEN SMITH
		Me, I got plans to be writer, and a writer's
		got a right to be nosey. Flores, you know 
		Rico from Buenos Aires... What's his story ?

	Dizzy uses her hand to divert the shower spray towards Johnny's crotch.

				DIZZY
		Well, some say he turned his back on the family
		fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for
		a girl... missed a spot there, bucko... which is 
		funny because Johnny says I joined up to be
		with him, but why would I do that ?
		He doesn't even like me.

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Don't look that way to me.

	Everyone look down at Johnny's crotch, laughing. Johnny
	blushes, grabs a towel and exits the shower. 

58	INT BARRACKS - NIGHT - INTO CAMERA - JOHNNY

	pans the barracks with a little handcam, neat bunks in a row, other recruits
	lounging around in their skivvies.

				JOHNNY
		I know it's not much, but it's home. Over
		there's my bunk where I dream about you
		every night...

Ace, Kitten Smith, Shujumi and Breckinridge dance around and moon the
	camera.

				JOHNNY
		Hey, do you mind ?

	Johnny moves the camera away from the guys. Katrina walks by from the
	shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame.

				KATRINA
		Hey, what's going on ?

				DIZZY
		I bet it's that girl I was talking about...
		Her name's Carmen, I think.

				ACE AND THE OTHERS
		Carmen ! Ooh la la, Carmencita !

				KATRINA
		Hi, Carmen !

	Johnny heads for the door.

				ACE AND THE OTHERS
		Hey, where you going ? Come back...! He's
		getting awy... Grab him...!

	The picture goes all screwy, comes up again on:

59	EXT	BARRACKS - NIGHT - INTO CAMERA - JOHNNY

	talk quietly now outside the barracks door.

				JOHNNY
		Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes
		I think I won't make it, but then I
		imagine you're watching me, and that
		gives me someting... I try harder.
		Thanks to you, I think I might have 
		a shot at squad leader.

	The barracks lights go out. Taps plays over the public address.
	Johnny lowers his voice.

				JOHNNY
		Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you're
		having fun, hope you're careful.
		No training accidents for you, eh ?
			(leaning into camera)
		I want to kiss you so badly. I want

		Assistant insructor... You must be some
		kind of a hot stick.
		Should I call you "sir" ?

				ZANDER
		Only when I give you an order.

				DELADIER
		Prepare for departure.

	Carmen and Zander go to work.

				CARMEN
		It's amazing, us running into each other
		like this. Maybe it's fate.

				ZANDER
		Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl
		coming through the academy, solid math,
		a little wild on the stick, but a natural.
		When it turned out it was you, I made
		sure we'd run into each other...

				DELADIER
		Alright, take her out, Ibanez.

				CARMEN
		Yes, ma'am.

	All eyes are on carmen as she grabs the stick. The ship shudders under
	her hand. She winks at Zander.

				CARMEN
		In simulation, my supervisors could never
		keep up.

				ZANDER
		This isn't simulation anymore.
		Take'er out easy, cadet.

				CARMEN
		Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?

				ZANDER
		Twenty-five by five, roll seven.
		And don't exceed port speed.

	Carmen rocks the stick, and the view from the bridge spins smoothly
	away from the dense orbiting yards os Luna toward the outer system.

				CARMEN
		Or...?

				ZANDER
		They revoke our flight status.

				CARMEN
		Oh, I see... teamwork.

	Carmen jogs past lumbering freighters. Zander's impressed.

				DELADIER
		Steady as she goes, number one.
		Prepare for warp. Number two,
		design for Jupiter orbit.

				ZANDER
		Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three...
		two... one...

	Space appears to bend. Zander and Carmen share a smile. They 
	blur together, becoming one, then:	WHAM !

66	EXT	LUNA - STARSHIP ATHENA

	disappears in a flash of blinding light.

67	EXT	WAR GAMES COURSE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	have been divided into two teams. RED TEAM includes Ace, Katrina,
	Breckinridge, and Djana'd. Johnny, Shujumi, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy
	are part of BLUE TEAM.

				ZIM
		The object of this exercise is to capture
		your enemy's flag before your enemy
		captures yours.

	Bronski passes out Morita SmartRifles.

				ZIM
		These weapons have been modified for
		this exercise. If your enemy hits you,
		your suit will fail. You will be unable
		to move. You will be as good as dead.

68	EXT	WAR GAMES COURSE - LATER - DJANA'D
	
	bumps the magnification of her heads up display to survey Blue Team's
	flag guarded by two recruits. She jumps down to joining other Red
	Team members on the move.

				DJANA'D
		It's right over the next ridge...
		Only two guards.

	Johnny, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy open fire from athicket as they pass.
	Djana'd and the others collapse as their suits fail, Djana'd laughing
	because playing at war seems funny.

				KITTEN SMITH
		You are now prisoners of the Blue Team.
		Tell us your plans or die !

				DJANA'D
		Oh no ! Name, rank, and mind your own
		business is all you get from me !

69	EXT	RED TEAM FLAG - DAY - RED TEAM

	opens fire as the Blue Team appears. Shujumi and other Blue Team members
	go down in an ambush led by Breckinridge. Johnny dives for cover, and finds
	himself sharing it with Dizzy.

				KITTEN SMITH
		I'm going in ! Let's go !

	Kitten Smith makes arun for the flag with a rifle team. Ace and Katrina open 
	fire from two new hidden Red Team positions, taking Kitten and his team
	down with a cross fire.

				JOHNNY
		Man, they're defended... no way in.

				DIZZY
		Flip six, three hole.

				JOHNNY
		What ?

				DIZZY
		High school... remember ? Run a flip
		six, three hole play, and you might
		score...

	Johnny looks at the course in a new way, nods.

				JOHNNY
		Cover me.

				DIZZY
		You got it.

	Johnny tumbles open ground, vaults into the air. Dizzy takes out Breckinridge
	as he rises to fire. Johnny lands, knocks out Katrina, then Ace. He picks up
	Ace's fallen Morita.

				JOHNNY
		Thanks, pal.

70	EXT	OBSERVATION TOWER - DAY - ZIM AND CORPORAL BRONSKI

	watch Johnny firing both Moritas simultanously and taking out the remaining
	Red Team defenders. He grabs the Red Team flag and hurls it into the air like spear.

				ZIM
		Kid's got some moves...

71	INT	AIRBORNE SKIMMER - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	line up in the door of a SKIMMER, the military's standard utility aircraft,
	to practice drops from altitude.

				ZIM
		Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO !
		Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !

				JOHNNY
		Sir, thank you, sir !

				ZIM
		Don't stand there dumb... GO !

	Johnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth.

				JOHNNY
		YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa...!

	Next in line, Ace scowls.

72	INT	BARRACKS - NIGHT - THE RECRUITS

	have some free time. Johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons
	that designate him as Squad Leader.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Look at him. Do you think anyone has
		ever been so pleased with himself ?

				ACE
		Zim hadda choose someone to be
		his brown nose, I guess.

				JOHNNY
		I just want you guys to know that I'll
		never do anything that I haven't asked
		you to do first.

	Johnny approaches Dizzy.

				JOHNNY
		Couldn't've done it without you, Diz.
		Friends ?

	Dizzy smiles, shakes.

				DIZZY
		Yeah, sure... friends.

	Bronski walks through with the mail.

				BRONSKI
		Levy... Shujumi... Rico.

	Johnny grabs the E-disk, pops it into his handcam. The Fleet Mail logo appears:
	APPROVED MESSAGE

				JOHNNY
		Bet it's from my girl.

	Johnny's pals gather for a look. Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, 
	in her quarters aboard starship Athena.

				CARMEN
		Hi, Johnny, I would've written sooner,
		but they've really got us going every 
		moment here.

				ACE
		Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that !

				JOHNNY
		Shhhh...!

				CARMEN
		I'm glad you're doing so well. If they 
		haven't made you squad leader by now,
		I'm sure you will.

	Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously.

				JOHNNY
		All it takes is the love of a good woman...

	The image changes abrupltly. Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit.
	She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck. Outside , the rings of
	Saturn sparkle in bright solar light.

				CARMEN
		Look at that. Isn't it beautiful ? I had 
		to show you. It's great to be out here on
		my own. I'm just not some little girl from
		Buenos Aires anymore. I'm gonna be a
		starship pilot, and I'm gonna see the
		universe...
			(she sighs)
		And that's also the problem because I
		don't really want to get married,
		Johnny. I don't want to have kids.
		I want a command, a ship of my own,
		and you know, I don't think that's 
		gonna leave a lot of room for you and
		me.

	Johnny is stunned. All the other recruits suddenly seem to have 
	something else to do.

				CARMEN
		I know that's not what you wanted to hear...
		but I have to follow my heart. I'm sorry.
		I'm afraid you'll hate me, and I couldn't
		stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me,
		so I'll know that we'll always be friends.

	The Fleet Mail logo appears again:	END OF MESSAGE. Johnny
	shuts the handcam off. Ace puts a hand on his shoulder.

				ACE
		Funny how they always want to be your friends
		after they kick your guts out.

				JOHNNY
		It's what I deserve.
	
				ACE
		Whad'ya talkin  about ?

				JOHNNY
		I joined up for her. I wouldn't even 
		be here if it wasn't for her.
		I'm a fool.

				ACE
		You made squad leader on your own,
		and, hey, you still got me to kick 
		around.

	Johnny smiles in spite of himself.

				JOHNNY
		Thanks, Ace.

	Johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin.
	Dizzy watches him leave. She'd so like to comfort him.

 73	EXT	LIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	arm their Marauder power suits. Zim and Bronski wear Command model suits
	with rank designations. Johnny checks weapons, scans the electronics on 
	each squad member's power suit.

				ZIM
		With the Marauder's visual capabilities,
		all you have to do is look at something
		to hit it, so you will exercise EXTREME
		CARE on my firing line.
		Do you get me ?

				RECRUITS
		Sir, yes, sir !

				ZIM
		The live firing combat range is the 
		closest simulation of actual combat
		we can provide. If you do not hit 
		your target, it will shoot you...

	Fifty blackened AUTOMATED TARGET DRONES fitted with pulse guns
	are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story
	building facades.

				ZIM
		The Marauder power suit will prevent
		serious injury, but if you are hit, you
		will be non-operational and your team 
		score will suffer accordingly. Rico,
		has each member of your squad completed
		a weapons safety check ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, yes, sir !

	On a signal from Zim, the Live Fire Combat Range comes to life
	as the target drones take cover and disappear from view.

				ZIM
		Perfect score for this exercise is 300.
		B company came through last week
		with 285. I expect you to do better.

74	EXT	LIVE FIRE COMBAT RANGE - DAY - THE RECRUITS

	take out the target drones as they appear. Halfway through the course,
	a recruit takes a hit and goes down, immobilized. Djana'd has a clear
	shot, but Breckinridge gets in her way.

				DJANA'D
		You're in my line of fire, Breckinridge

	Before the others can react, a second drone appears.

				JOHNNY
		CROSSFIRE ! EVERYBODY DOWN !

	Everyone kisses dirt. Pulses from the two drones fly thick overhead.
	Shujumi rises to fire, a round slams him back to the ground.
	Johnny and Djana'd knock out the two drones.

				JOHNNY
		Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes
		point. Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover
		the flanks. Djana'd, you're rear guard.
		Move out.

	The squad resumes ist advance. Breckinridge bangs on his helmet.
	There is something wrong with his "head up" display.

				JOHNNY
		What's the problem ?

				BRECKINRIDGE
		Dunno. Display's fritzed.

				DJANA'D
		Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up
		our score...
			
				JOHNNY
		Let me see.

	Breckinridge takes off helmet, hands it to Johnny. Djana'd turns on
	Breckinridge. Her "head up" zeroes him.

				DJANA'D
		How come when something goes wrong,
		it's always you, Breckinridge ?

	That's when Djana'd trips on a loose stone. She fumbles her rifle and
	it discharges. The round tears the top of Breckinridge's head off.
	The recruits stare in horror.

				JOHNNY
		Oh, God... uh... MEDIC !

	Zim arrives with Bronski on the bounce.

				ZIM
		Rico, you are relieved of squad command.
		Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico
		to the C.O.'s Office.

	The recruits watch Johnny leave, stare aghast at their dead comrade.
	No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing.

75	INT	C.O.'S OFFICE - DAY - JOHNNY

	stands before the C.O. braced by Katrina and Ace. Zim and the C.O.  are
	both saddened by the proceedings.

				C.O.
		Rico, did you give the recruit permission
		to remove his helmet ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a
		helmet malfunction, and I asked him
		to show it to me, sir.

				C.O.
		Are you rated to repair a Marauder
		power suit, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, no, sir.

				C.O.
		Then why did you order your man to 
		remove his helmet during a live fire
		exercise ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir, I needed everyone in my squad
		operational, sir... I... I wanted to win,
		sir.

				C.O:
			(sigh)
		You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404.
		You may, of course, demand trial by 
		court martial.

				JOHNNY
		Sir, no, sir !

				C.O.
		Do you freely admit to the charges
		made against you ?

				JOHNNY
		Sir... I guess I do, sir.

	Zim looks out the window. Djana'd, dressed for travel, in civilian clothes,
	crying as she heads off down Washout Lane.

				C.O.
		Sergeant, we've lost two recruits
		over this incident already...
		is there any possibility of salvaging
		this man ?

				Zim
		I believe so, sir.

				C.O.
		Alright. We'll try administrative
		punishment. Until then you are 
		confined to your quarters, Rico.

76	INT	BARRACKS - SUNSET - JOHNNY

	looks out the window to the parade ground where a POST has been
	erected. The recruits look up as Zim enters.

				ZIM
		Alright, let's go, Rico.

	Johnny takes off his shirt. Ace who now holds the chevrons of squad
	leader, watches, feels bad for his pal.

77	EXT	PARADE GROUND - SUNSET - THE RECRUITS

	stand with recruits from other platoons. Johnny is led to the post and 
	strung up as the C.O. reads the charge.

				C.O.
		For incompetence of command, for
		failure to abide by safety regulations
		in a live fire exercise, for negligence 
		which contributed to the death of a
		teammate...

	Zim steps up to Johnny, offers him a red rubber mouthpiece.

				ZIM
		Bite on this. It helps. I know.

				C.O.
		... recruit trainee John Rico is sentenced
		to administrative punishment. Ten lashes.

	Johnny takes it in his mouth. His tear away shirt is torn away. Johnny
	stands at the post alone. Corporal Bronski, a big man with an unhappy
	task, unrolls his whip.

				C.O.
		You may carry out the sentence.

				BRONSKI
		One.
	
	CRACK !	Johnny's face wrenched by pain, spontanous tears, a terrible
	sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece.

				BRONSKI
		Two.
	
	CRACK !	Again. Dizzy flinches for Johnny.

				BRONSKI
		Three.

	CRACK !	Ace looks away.

				BRONSKI
		Four.

	CRACK !	Zim watches without any apparent emotion.

				BRONSKI
		Five.

	CRACK !	Johnny faints, sagging against his tether.

	and Carmen.

				CARMEN
		Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch
		always seems to last forever.

				ZANDER
		Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you
		are spending it with.

	He caresses her hair. She kisses his hand. Zander notices the plot map.

				ZANDER
		Profile's wrong... there.

				CARMEN
		No, I replotted the course. It's more
		efficient this way.

				ZANDER
		Three weeks aboard a starship and you
		know it all, huh ?

				CARMEN
		Hey, check it.

	Zander slides into his chair, runs a check.

				ZANDER
		You know I was talking to Captain,
		Deladier, and she said...

				CARMEN
		Don't change the subject. Am I right ?

				ZANDER
		Well, whad'ya know...

				CARMEN
		Don't mess with the boss. So what'd
		the captain say ?

				ZANDER
		She got a command... and she thinks we 
		oughta team up officially and crew for her.
		She thinks we're good together.

				CARMEN
		You and me, huh ?

	Zander turns his chair so they are very close, moves a finger along
	her hand, up her arm and playfully around her breasts.

				ZANDER
		I have a feeling about us. We're good
		together, way ahead of the curve in 
		every department. I seem to be able to
		anticipate your needs. 
		You know what I want...

	Carmen grabs him between his legs.

				CARMEN
		No, what do you want ?

	Zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately. She brteaks it off,
	gets serious for amoment.

				CARMEN
		I want to be part of the best flight team 
		in the Fleet...

				ZANDER
		Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.

	They start to caress again when suddenly ALARMS sound. Captain 
	Deladier appears on the hot screen, still waking up.

				DELADIER
		Report.

				ZANDER
		Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified
		object moving at near light speed...

	Carmen and Zander frantically check their displays.

				CARMEN
		WHERE IS IT ?

				ZANDER
		THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !

				CARMEN
		It looks like an... asteroid.

				DELADIER
		In this part of the system ?

	Carmen and Zander see it through the front screens:		A huge
	ASTEROID tumbles directly towards them at terrific speed.

				ZANDER
		Sweet Jesus...!

	Carmen breaks glass that reads EMERGENCY RETROS, arms the switch 
	within and fires the rockets.

80	EXT	OUTER SYSTEM - STARSHIP ATHENA

	torques to one side. The asteroid grazes the ship, cutting ahuge gash

	Deladier arrives on the bridge, now crowded as other FLIGHT OFFICERS
	rush to their stations. Zander's going through star charts.

				DELADIER
		Where'd it come from ?

				ZANDER
		Trajectory indicates it came out of 
		the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

				DELADIER
		Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em
		there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

				COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
		Communications are down, ma'am.

				DELADIER
		Engineering. Damage assessment.

				ENGINEERING OFFICER
		Hull's compromised. 
		We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

	Deladier notices Carmen staring at a monitor, stunned. A DEAD
	CAP TROOPER trails in the wreckage of the flight deck.

				DELADIER
		Good work, Number 1. You'll do.

				CARMEN
		Thank you, ma'am.

85	INT	BARRACK'S - DAY - JOHNNY

		I don't stay where I'm not wanted.

		Johnny ! Where's your uniform...?

	Johnny's mother makes a face to shut him up.

				FATHER
		Well, it's just good to hear from you.
		What's up, son ?

				JOHNNY
		It's not really working out for me here,
		dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it

		tomorrow !

	Newly minted cap troopres Johnny, Dizzy, Ace, and Kitten Smith happen along.

				NET CORRESPONDENT
		Here's a bunch of M.I. kids who look like they
		eat bugs for lunch !

				DIZZY
		Yum, yum yum ...!

				NET CORRESPONDENT
		So you're not to worried about fighting the
		Arachnids...?

				ACE
		Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, 
		lotta dead bugs, am I right ?

				KITTEN SMITH
		I just hope it's not over before we get in it !

				NET CORRESPONDENT
		Some say the bugs were provoked by human 
		attempts to colonize within the AQZ, that a
		"live and let live" policy is preferable to
		war with the bugs...

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, well, I'm from Buenos Aires, and
		I say kill'em all !

97	INT	RECREATION DECK - NIGHT CYCLE - JOHNNY

	and his friends drink at a crowded bar. Around the room there's 
	singing and dancing, a mad sort of revelry bred of fear and
	excitement, but nearby a VETERAN drinks alone.

				KITTEN SMITH
		That guy's been in it.

				JOHNNY
		How can you tell ?

				KITTEN SMITH
		The eyes. He's got the 1000 meters stare.

	He's hard and humorless, all wised up. Ace admires his LASER CUT TATTOOS.
	Dizzy eyes his skull and crossbone earring.

				ACE
		Great scars.

				DIZZY
		I like the jewelry. Hey, amigo, where can
		I get an earring like yours ?

				VETERAN
		Port Joe Smith, Outer Rings, Dantana...
		Every time I come back from a drop, my
		gunny gives me a bone. I got three now.
		You don't see a lot of guys with three.

				JOHNNY
		Waht's it like... combat ?

				VETERAN
		I guess it's not so bad. I mean as 
		long as you don't get any on you.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Get any what on you ?

				VETERAN
		Oh, you'll know when it happens.
		See you on the bounce.

	The veteran pays his tab and heads out.

				ACE
		I say we all go to the laser parlor
		and get cut together.

				JOHNNY
		What do I want with a scar ?

				DIZZY
		What, your skin's too pretty ?
		C'mon, everyone's doing it !

				CARMEN (V.O.)
		Hey	Johnny !	Johnny Rico !

	Johnny looks up and sees Carmen. She lloks graet in uniform with 
	the hat and the lieutenant's bars on her shoulders.

				JOHNNY
		Carmen... ?

	Johnny remembers himself, snaps to attention, salutes. Dizzy and the others 
	follow suit. Carmen salutes back, sheepish.

				CARMEN
		Oh... at ease. Guess I oughta lose the hat
		when I'm off duty, eh ?

	Dizzy, disgusted, turns back to Ace and Kitten Smith. Carmen tucks her hat
	under her arm. Her hair is very short.
	
				JOHNNY
		What happened to your hair ?

				CARMEN
		What do you think ? Everyone did it when 
		we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?

				JOHNNY
		It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone
		made it out of B.A. alive ?

	Carmen shakes her head, sadly.

				CARMEN
		It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it
		hits me, and I can't stop crying.

				JOHNNY
		I try just to be happy I'm still alive.

				CARMEN
		You don't look very happy to see me.

				JOHNNY
		Should I be ?

				CARMEN
		Johnny... Life is so different from the 
		way it was. One day you'll see what
		I did was best for both of us.

	Zander leaves a group of FLEET OFFICERS to join them.

				ZANDER
		Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?

				CARMEN
		Zander, you remember Johnny ?
		Zander and I are a flight team now.

	Zander puts his arm around Carmen, gives her a squeeze.

				ZANDER
		Best in the Fleet !

				JOHNNY
		I get it. This is the part that's best
		for both of us.
		Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?

	Johnny turns to leave.

				CARMEN
		Johnny, wait...

				ZANDER
		Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery
		does a thankless, dirty job, so they 
		naturally tend to be short-tempered,
		thoughtless and rude.

	Johnny turns back to face Zander.

				JOHNNY
		You got something to say about the
		Mobile Infantery ?

				ZANDER
		You heard me. Wanna make something
		out of it, private ?

				JOHNNY
		Not with an officer, no, sir.
		The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap
		troopers.

	Everyone can see what's about to happen. A circle is forming,
	Fleet on one side, Mobile Infantery on the other.

				ZANDER
		Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear
		that ? Rank is not an issue here.

				CARMEN
		Zander, please... Let's go !

	Zander takes off his hat.

				ZANDER
		It's alright. What's he gonna do ?

	WHAM !	Johnny punches him right in the nose. Zander goes down,
	bleeding. Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny.

				ACE
		Whoa, easy there, buddy... Nice punch.

	Zander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but Fleet Officers pull him
	back. Carmen looks at Johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist.

				CARMEN
		What's wrong with you ?

				JOHNNY
		Hey, it's just a vestigal response to 
		procreation... bitch.

	Carmen turns away, stung. Johnny immediately regrets. Dizzy,
	for her part, couldn't be happier.

				DIZZY
		Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and
		Fleet weren't meant to mix !

98	INT	LASER PARLOR - NIGHT CYCLE - JOHNNY
	
	grinds his teeth as a laser mounted on a robot arm finishes slicing an
	intricate pattern into his arm.

				JOHNNY
		It hurts...!

	Dizzy, Ace, and Kitten Smith awtch, grinning, passing a bottle.
	Ace pours booze directly into the fresh wound.

				ACE
		No, this hurts.

				JOHNNY
		YAAAAAAAA !

				KITTEN SMITH
		Well, here's to it ! We're gonna fightn, and
		we're gonna win !

	They put their arms side by side. Each has a similiar scar:
	Lightning bolts on a shield and the words:	DEATH FROM ABOVE.

				ACE
		Mobile Infantery rules !

				JOHNNY
		Death to all bugs !

				DIZZY
		Don't get any on you !

	wait to drop with other cap troopers. Their mood is grim.
	LIEUTENANT WILLY, 35, easy-going and confident, enters.

				ACE
		Officer on deck !

	Everyone snaps to attention.

				LT. WILLY
		At ease. Alright... we got hot poop straight
		from the top:
		Willy's Wildcats is in with the first wave.
		Means more bugs for us to kill...

	This does nothing to break the tension. Lt. Willy reassures.

				LT. WILLY
		Now if you follow orders and remember
		your training, I guarantee you'll make it
		back alive. Any questions ?

	There are none.

				LT. WILLY
		Alright... next we got a little last minute
		briefing from Military Intelli-gence I
		think you're gonna like...

	The briefingplays on "head up" displays and the ready room screens. A
	captive BUG WARRIOR clicks and shrieks as FEDERAL SCIENTISTS
	torture it. The troopers cheer.

				OFFICIAL VOICE
		Everyday Federal scientists are looking for
		new ways to kill bugs and you can help...

	The head scientists turns and speaks to camera. It's Carl.
	Johnny and Dizzy share an amazed grin, noticing a difference in
	their old friend, something that speaks of... authority.

				CARL
		To defeat the enemy, we must know the
		enemy. Take for instance your basic
		Arachnid warrior. Minimal IQ, armored, 
		completely lethal. You can blow a limb off...

	Carl picks up apulse gun and blows one of the bugs legs off.
	The insect screams.

				CARL
		... and it's still 86% combat effec-tive.
		But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem
		and put it down for good.

	Carl fires again. The bug kicks and squeals as it dies.
	Carl tosses the pulse gun aside.

				CARL
		Now while you are out killing bugs,
		we want you to be our eyes and ears.
		The bugs use some kind of plasma burst
		to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth.
		We need to know how they do this. If you
		encounter any plasma, report it immediately
		to your superior. Good luck and good hunting !

	The briefing ends as klaxons sound.

				P.A. (O.S.)
		This is the Captain speaking.
		All personnel prepare for drop.We
		are at D minus three and counting.

				LT. WILLY
		Move out !

	Johnny and the other troopers climb into capsules on the port track.
	Dizzy gives him "thumbs up". The capsule seals as it moves with 
	the others down the firing tube.

101	INT	CAPSULE - JOHNNY

	gets the shakes as the capsule bumps and booms toward the firing
	tube. Lt. Willy appears on the "head up" display.

				LT. WILLY
		Smash the entire area, kill anything that

		of you loafers come back aboard with

	defensive fire.

				DELADIER
		This isn't random or light.
		Someone made amistake...!

				ZANDER
		That's it, we're empty ma'am !

	Out the front screens, a blast from below hits George Marshall amidships
	and it reels into Yamamoto. Both starships begin to burn.

				DELADIER
		Someone made a big goddam mistake !
		Get us out of here, Number 1 !

	Carmen dodges past burning ships, avoids collision with Dauntless,
	and then KA-WHAM !	they're hit. Carmen flies out of her

	of cap troopers in ordered rows drifting down into the cloud layer. 
	It's quiet in the clouds, then:

108	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - FROM THE AIR - JOHNNY

	looks down as he passes out of the clouds and sees the battlefield.
	Plasma blasts exploode into the sky. THOUSANDS OF BUGS boil
	out of the ground to defend against the invader.

	None of it compares to the sound of his own racing HEARTBEAT.
	Lieutenant Willy shouts.

				LIEUTENANT WILLY
		Up there on the ridge ! We'll nuke those bug positions
		from theAAAAAAAA !

	A HOPPER (an airborne Arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and "pop out"
	wings for gliding) lands on Lieutenant Willy and cracks his head like a nut.

				ACE
		KILL IT !

	Johnny and Ace open fire, backing away. Pulse rounds tear it apart, bug guts
	gushing.

				JOHNNY
		Lieutenant's bought the farm.
		Where's the Sarge...?

				ACE
		I didn't see him !

	Now comes a flood of WORKERS building ever advancing fortifications,
	and with them, hundreds of deadly ARACHNID WARRIORS.

				KITTEN SMITH
		Here they come...!

				DIZZY
		Ace, what're we doing ?

				ACE
		I uh... uh...

	Dizzy and the others open fire simultanously. The whole area goes white hot
	in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. Shujumi fires wildly at 
	advancing insects.

				SHUJUMI
		You want some ? Here's some !
		C'MON !

				JOHNNY
		Don't waste your ammon on the 
		workers !

	Shujumi can't hear. A warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back
	into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs.

				SHUJUMI
		AAAAAAAAAAAA !

	He fights, screaming. A claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off.

				KATRINA
		Let's get out of here !

	Now the ground opens behind her and a huge (6 meters) TANKER BUG 
	lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel-shaped snout extruding above
	multiple eyes.

				DIZZY
		Look out !

	The tanker bug sprays and hits Katrina. She screams, as her legs melt out
	from under her.

				KATRINA
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Warriors converge to feed on her. Ace wants to help her, but Johnny blocks him.

				JOHNNY
		C'mon, Katrina was right. We 
		gotta get out of here !

110	EXT	KLENDATHU - NIGHT - JOHNNY

	and the other survivors on the bounce. The entire surface of Klendathu seems
	to be churning with insects as more and more bugs come to the surface to
	repel the invasion.

				JOHNNY
		It's a general retreat ! The boats are
		coming down.

	They come to the rear lines where the Net Correspondent and his
	CAMERAMAN are doing live coverage of the invasion.

				NET CORRESPONDENT
		We've just landed here on what cap troopers 
		are calling the "Big K" with the 6th Mobile
		Infantery Division. It's an ugly planet, a bug
		planet, a planet hostile to life as we kow iGKKKKK !

	The Correspondent is cut in half by a warrior. Johnny blows it away.

				JOHNNY
		C'mon, let's go ! ON THE BOUNCE !

	The cap troopers move out. Kitten Smith looks up as a purple beacon
	 streaks acroos thr sky.

				KITTEN SMITH
		I can see the beacon...!

				ACE
		Retrieval !

	A hopper pounces on Kitten Smithm, and he goes down screaming.

				JOHNNY
		KITTEN !

	Johnny touches down, stares in horror as Kitten Smith's head rolls past his 
	fee. Johnny opens up with his pulse cannon. The hopper attacks, puts a claw
	right through Johnny's thigh.

				JOHNNY
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Crushing jaws close around him, crushing, cutting his flesh. Johnny brings the muzzle
	of the pulse gun under the hopper's nerve stem and SPLAT !	blows its head apart.

				DIZZY
		Johnny !	JOHNNY !	WHERE ARE YOU ?
		JOHNNY !	Johnny...!

	But Dizzy can't find Johnny, and soon she's lost in the smoke. Johnny looks
	down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes.

				JOHNNY
		Medic... MEDIC...!

	Now two more Arachnid warriors close in on him through the enveloping
	smoke. He fires his pulse rifle empty, and dropping it, crawls desperately,
	dragging his useless leg.

				JOHNNY
		Oh, God... Oh, God, help me...
		please help me...!

	A third Arachnid warrior rears up in front of him, deadly jaws slashing down
	toward him, when suddenly it is blown to pieces in the blinding blast of a
	point-blank pulse cannon.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Take my hand !

	Johnny reaches out. A STEEL HAND takes his, dragging him back as bugs
	attack. His rescuers's pulse cannon thunders overhead. Bug parts fly as 
	insects swarm in for the kill.

				JOHNNY
		Looks like you've got a little bug
		problem, ma'am...

				BIRDIE
		Stow it, trooper. Give it verything
		you've got !

	The cao troopers let the bugs have it, but the insects keep coming, the living
	crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a
	TANKER BUG.

				JOHNNY
		WATCH OUT !

	The tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole.
	Rasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus
	an arm, screaming.

				BIRDIE
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Johnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole. It turns 
	with surprising speed. Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his
	pulse cannon.

				RASCZAK
		Sugar, in for pick up !

	Rasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety. Johnny fires a rocket into 
	the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear. KA-WHAP !
	The big bug explodes.

				RASCZAK
		Gas that hole and close it !

	The Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole. Johnny touches down
	beside Rasczak.

				RASCZAK
		Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?

				JOHNNY
		Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you
		remember ? I was captain of the
		team.

				RASCZAK
		I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico,
		I need a corporal. You're it until you're
		dead or I find someone better.

	Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past
	to meet an arriving skimmer.

				RASCZAK
		Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes
		with a factory guarantee !

	Dizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back.

				DIZZY
		Way to go, amigo !

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna need a squad leader.

				ACE
		No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive 
		material.

				JOHNNY
		What about it, Diz ?

				DIZZY
			(a snappy salute)
		Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

	Tac Fighters reel by over head. WOMP ! Suddenly, BUG PLASMA shoots skyward
	from the flatlands below. Several Tac Fighters are blown out of the air.
	Flaming debris rains down.

				RASCZAK
		Saddle up, Roughnecks. That's
		our trash !

	Roughnecks head out on the bounce.

126	EXT	TANGO URILLA - RIDGE - DAY - JOHNNY

	and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular
	pit some ten meters across. Inside, something is moving.

				JOHNNY
		What kind of stinkin' bug is that ?

	Johnny jumps the magnification on his "head up". Down in the pit, a giant
	translucent PLASMA BUG rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels
	that ring the battery.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		You never seen how they do it before ?

	Johnny shakes his head. Swollen BREEDER BUGS gather around the 
	plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly.

				ACE
		Agghh ! It's making me sick...!

	The plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from
	yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		It's gonna pop !

	WOMP ! The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron. A blast of bug plasma
	streaks past them towards the heavens. Now a new plasma bug crawls into
	the pit to begin the cycle anew.

				GILLESPIE
		Sir, look !

	Sergeant Gillespie points. A hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors
	rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position.

				RASCZAK
		We must be right over the colony.
		Let's get some air support, eh ?

				GILLESPIE
		Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck
		patrol, over ...?

	Rasczak moves off down the line giving orders.

				RASCZAK
		Corporal, I want pulse cannons there
		and there ! Rifle teams, spread out
		along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that
		flame thrower !

				GILLESPIE
		Fleet's pulling the battle group back
		to safe distance... They'd like us to
		knock out those batteries, sir.

				RASCZAK
		They'd rather spend our lives than
		risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?

				DIZZY
		That'd be me, sir.

				RASCZAK
		Heat it up.

	Dizzy activates a tactical nuke. It makes a distinctive HIGHPITCHED SQUEAL.

				RASCZAK
		Roughnecks, you may fire at will.

	The Roughnecks open fire. Bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing. A 
	warrior breeches their line. Sugar Watkins torches it. The nuke's ready light flashes.

				DIZZY
		I'm hot, sir !

				RASCZAK
		FIRE ! BLAST SHIELDS DOWN !

	Johnny blows a warrior away from the edge. Dizzy leans over and fires. The rocket 
	streaks down toward the battery.

				RASCZAK
		HIT THE DIRT !

	An explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white. When color
	returns Johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the 
	bug battery.

				GILLESPIE
		Now comes the part I hate the most.

				JOHNNY
		What's that ?

				GILLESPIE
		We go down into the colony and make
		sure all the queens are dead.

127	INT	TUNNELS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	fight their way down gassed-out tunnels into bug city. They meet warrors at
	every turn and kill them. Helmet lamps make weird shadows of dead bugs 
	piled everywhere along the way.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		You knew the Lieutenant before the war...
		What was he like ?

				JOHNNY
		He was a teacher , kind of a know it all...
		Always had this little smile.
	
				SUGAR WATKINS
		Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him 
		smile.

				JOHNNY
		Must fill your bottle up real quick
		when your wife and kids get smeared.

	Johnny joins Rasczak, Ace and Dizzy and they blow away several warriors
	guarding the entrance of a large chamber.

128	INT	BUG NURSERY - DAY - THE QUEENS

	are eight meters long with corpulent bodies and tiny heads. Only one survives,
	and though she is herself dying, her abdomen, rippled by life within, continues to
	undulate.

				JOHNNY
		All dead except one, sir.

				RASCZAK
		Kill the bitch.

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir.

	Johnny signals. Dizzy's pulse cannon rips open the dying queen. Thousands of
	wriggling premature bugs come spilling out. Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks
	set them afire.

129	EXT	TANGO URILLA - BASE CAMP - DAY - FLEET ENGINEERS

	unload PRE-FAB BARRACKS from HERCULES CARGO BOATS. 
	Roughnecks eat. Rasczak stands, banging a spoon on his mess kit.

				RASCZAK
		Tango Urilla is now bug free. Means
		the Roughnecks have killed  a
		helluva lotta bugs...!

	Roughnecks cheer. Rasczak kicks open a CARGO MODULE. Beer kegs
	rool out. He kicks open a second module. Inside, musical instruments.
	Ace picks up a violin.

				RASCZAK
		I expect the best, but I give the best.
		Habve some fun. That's an order !

130	EXT	BASE CAMP - NIGHT - LATER - ACE

	leads a little quartet, plays a sweet fiddle. Roughnecks laugh and dance.
	Dizzy tries to pull Johnny into the fun.

				DIZZY
		C'mon...

				JOHNNY
		Nah, I don't do that anymore...

				DIZZY
		You used to dance...

				JOHNNY
		I said no. Want me to pull rank ?

				DIZZY
		Well, excuse me, sir...

	Dizzy heads back to the others. Johnny turns and finds Rasczak regarding him 
	with an odd, sad smile.

				RASCZAK
		Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico.
		Want some now ?

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir...

				RASCZAK
		Never pass up a good thing, eh ?

	Gillespie appears.

				GILLESPIE
		Lieutenant, Brigade's on the com...

	Rasczak heads away. Johnny joins Dizzy.

				JOHNNY
		Hey, Diz...

				DIZZY
		What ?

	Johnny takes her hand, bows implishly.

				JOHNNY
		May I have the honor ?

	He pulls her out among the others and they begin to dance. Ace watches
	with a grin, puts some spirit in his fiddle.

131	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - NIGHT - RASCZAK

	is in holo conference with an INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		At 0821 we received a distress call from 
		Planet P, priority code, requesting
		reinforcement...

				RASCZAK
		I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P. 

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Owen reported the eradication of a low
		generation colony a month ago. That's why 
		MICOM wants onsite assessment.

				RASCZAK
		Sounds more like some idiot at
		Military Intelligence Command
		wants to get me and my cap troopers 
		killed...

	The Intelligence Officer reddens.

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Take your group down to P and have a 
		look see. Leave the thinking to us,
		Lieutenant. That's not your job.

				RASCZAK
		My job is to protect the lives of my
		soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major,
		and if you're walking me into a trap-

				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
		Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't
		intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid
		enough to follow orders !

				VOICE (O.S.)
		That'll be all, Major. Dismissed.

	The Intelligence Officer disappears abruptly. A new hologram appears.
	Rasczak's jaw drops. It's his former student Carl Jenkins, now a Colonel,
	weary and pissed off.

				CARL
		This conference is over. Do your duty,
		Lieutenant. That's an order.

	Rasczak recovers, salutes stiffly.

				RASCZAK
		Yes, sir.

132	INT	PRE-FAB SLEEPING UNIT - DAY - JOHNNY AND DIZZY

	are making love. The door pops open. Rasczak stands there. Dizzy ducks under
	the covers. Johnny manages a salute.

				RASCZAK
		Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving
		out for Planet P immediately. Get
		yourself squared away and report to
		Gillespie for logistics.

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir !

				RASCZAK
		Who's that with you ?

	Dizzy shows herself, grinning.

				RASCZAK
		Report in ten minutes.

	Rasczak slams the door shut on them. They fall back into one anothers arms,
	laughing as they resume lovemaking.

				DIZZY
		Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?

				JOHNNY
		They ran out of names a long time
		ago in this part of the galaxy.

133	EXT	PLANET P - BAD LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	move through canyons of towering wind-carved rock formations.
	Gillespie carries the communications package.

				GILLESPIE
		I don't understand it, Lieutenant.
		It's not getting anything from 4th
		Brigade...
		not even their transponder.

				RASCZAK
		Keep trying, Sergeant.

134	EXT	CANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	walk in a column far below. Something is watching from the above... HOPPERS,
	lots of them, moving from rock to rock for better position.

135	EXT	CANYON FLOOR - CONTINUING - DAY - ACE
	
	sees something out of the corner of his eye.

				JOHNNY
		BUGS...!

	The hoppers hit. Several Roughnecks go down. Everyone opens up. 
	Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits. Roughnecks set them on fire 
	when they hit the ground.

				DIZZY
		Johnny, watch out !

	A burning bug hurls itself at Johnny. Johnny jumps out of the way as
	Dizzy fires, blowing it apart. The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere
	above them in the rocks.

				RASCZAK
		LET'S GO ! ON THE BOUNCE !

136	EXT	FLAT LANDS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	move out into the open. In the distance they see 4th Brigade HQ, a walled 
	compound and partially constructed landing pad.

				RASCZAK
		Gillespie, put in call for retrieval.
		We're off this rock.
		Gillespie, do you read me ?

				GILLESPIE
		AAAAAAAAAAA !

	Two hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs
	join to feast.

				RASCZAK
		Throw a rifle !

	Dizzy tosses her Morita to Rasczak. Gillespie writhes in the hopper's
	claws. Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie.

				RASCZAK
		I expext any one here to do the same
		for me... Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy
		prepare for rear guard action. The rest
		of you make for 4th Brigade.

	Johnny and the others cover the Roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down
	on the flat lands from the canyon walls.

				RASCZAK
		FIRE...!

	Johnny and the others blast bugs out of the air.

				RASCZAK
		FALL BACK 100 METERS...!

	A second wave of hoppers come in.

				RASCZAK
		AND FIRE...!

	For now, the sky is clear.

				RASCZAK
		4TH BRIGADE HQ ! ON THE BOUNCE !

137	EXT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE OUTPOST

	is 50 meters by 100, standard issue pre-fab. The Roughnecks land on the
	compound wall. Inside, WORKER BUGS graze on the remains of 200
	dead cap troopers strewn over the complex.

				RASCZAK
		Jeez, Command really humped the bunk
		on this one...

	Rasczak turns away. Roughnecks engage in the sport of methodically
	killing the workers.

				RASCZAK
		Rico, you're acting Sergeant now.
		My last Sergeant lost the com pack.
		Put together a search team and find
		the radio shack.
		We need retrieval.

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir.

138	INT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - OFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - JOHNNY

	everywhere.

				DIZZY (O.S.)
		It's here, sir.

139	INT	COMMINICATIONS - DAY - RASCZAK AND JOHNNY

	enter the radio room. A DEAD MAJOR is slumped over the console with
	hole in the back of his head. Johnny checks the equipment. 
	It' dead, too.

				JOHNNY
		Diz, see what you can do.

				DIZZY
		I'm on it !

	Dizzy goes to work. Rasczak checks the wound in the back of the dead major's
	head.

				RASCZAK
		What's that look like to you, Rico ?

				JOHNNY
		Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

				ACE (O.S.)
		Lieutenant, I think you're gonna
		wanna see this, sir.

140	INT	MESS HALL - DAY - A BUG HOLE

	in the middle of the floor is surrounded by carnage.

				ACE
		Dirty bugs came in right when they 
		were having chow !

				RASCZAK
		Gas that hole and seal it.

	Then they hear a sound. Tap tap tap. Rasczak signals for quiet. Tap tap tap tap.
	It's coming from the kitchen.

141	INT	KITCHEN - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	enter cautiously. The noise is coming from a freezer. Ace stands ready to fire.
	Johnny levers open the door, jumps back as GENERAL OWEN, 60, tumbles out
	face first.

				ACE
		Officer on the deck, sir.

				RASCZAK
		Pick up the general !

	Roughnecks prop him up. General Owen tries to talk, but no words come out.
	Rasczak bends down to listen.

				GENERAL OWEN
		Get out... you gotta get me out...!

				RASCZAK
		General Owen, sir ?

	The old man grins, hugely relieved.

				GENERAL OWEN
		At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for you,
		for all of you...this is grand...
		so where's the boat ?

142	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - HALLWAY - DAY - JOHNNY AND RASCZAK

	help the old General, now wrapped in a blanket, rambling.

				GENERAL OWEN
		I was forced to hide, of course. The security
		of the Federation in this theater of operations
		was at stake !

				JOHNNY
		Diz, what's with the uplink ?

	Dizzy lokks up from where she is working on the radio controls.

				DIZZY
		Workin on it...!

				GENERAL OWEN
		They get in your mind... they make you do
		things ! Look here... They did it to Farley...!

	He points at the hole of the dead major's head.

				RASCZAK
		The distress call... The bugs wanted us 
		to rescue you...!

				GENERAL OWEN
		Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were
		biding their time... waiting for the most
		opportune moment !

	Rasczak's lost interest in the general. He's on the com.

				RASCZAK
		To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak.
		Prepare for attack. Repeat. We are
		going to be attacked...!

				GENERAL OWEN
		They weren't gonna do it to me.
		Oh no ! I know too many secrets !

	Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt.

				SUGAR WATKINS (O.S.)
		Fire in the hole !

	An explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole.

143	EXT	OFFICE COMPLEX - DAY - GENERAL OWEN

	blinks as he steps out into the light. Roughnecks snap to attention. 
	General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and
	begins to keen, collapsing to his knees.

				GENERAL OWEN
		Oh God...! My soldiers...! All of my
		boys and girls...!

	The Roughnecks are shocked. They've never seen a general break down before.
	Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard.

				LT. RASCZAK
		Shut up ! Your soldier's dead and
		you're not !

				GENERAL OWEN
		I know... I wish you'd shoot me...

				LT. RASCZAK
		I oughta !

	And it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down
	next to Johnny and Rasczak.

				ACE
		Lieutenant, we got trouble !

144	EXT	RAMPARTS - DAY - RASCZAK

		with the wounded. Rico, where's my

	Johnny runs for the communications room.

				JOHNNY
		We don't have a minute !

145	INT	COMMUNICATIONS - DAY - DIZZY

			All bands.

			Roughneck patrol to battle group...
			Roughneck patrol to battle group...

			Landing zone is extremely hostile.
			Come down on this transmission !

			Inside 4th brigade compound ?
			That's crazy !

			Then I hope you have a crazy 
			pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !

	Johnny races out the door.

146	EXT	4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - THE COMPOUND

	is white hot as Roughnecks on the walls unload nukes. Johnny crosses 
	the compound, lands next to Rasczak on the wall.

				JOHNNY
		Boat coming down, sir !

	The Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes.

				ROUGHNECKS
		I'm empty...all nuked out... Me, too !

	Johnny scans the battlefield. Nukes have turned the surface into dark glass.
	Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath 
	millions of marching feet.

				ACE
		Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!

				JOHNNY
		Not enough, I guess.

	Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below,
	stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		General ! GENERAL, stay with the wounded...
		Sir, the general...!

				RASCZAK
		Ah, the hell with him...

	Hoppers sweep into the compound. The Roughnecks open fire. General Owen
	make easy pickings for ones that get through.

				RASCZAK
		Fall back... form a circle ! If no 
		living bug comes over that wall,
		we cannot be harmed.

	Dizzy arrives on thr bounce as the Roughnecks fall back into the compound.
	Bugs pile in over the walls. The circle affords them 360 degrees of kill zone.

				RASCZAK
		Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy ! We 
		control the sky until retrieval !

				JOHNNY ET AL
		Yes, sir !

	Rasczak, Sugar Watkins, Johnny and Dizzy stand back-to-back in the center
	of the circle, sweeping the skies with the heavy guns from the towers.
	Hoppers are blown to pieces.

				ACE
		Getting low here, sir !

				DIZZY
		300 rounds and counting, sir !

				RASCZAK
		Make every shot count !

	Johnny looks up. A RETRIEVAL BOAT hurtles down through bursts of 
	bug plasma, takes a grazing hit, rights itself with retros and lands within 
	the circle. Roughnecks cheer, saved !

				RASCZAK
		Sergeant, secure the boat !

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir !

	Roughnecks move to protect the boat. The hatch blows open.

				RASCZAK
		Board the wounded !

	Dead bugs ring the compound walls, forming ramps for living insect
	soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers.

				RASCZAK
		Move to retrieval on my command !
		First group, now...!

	The circle shrinks as Roughnecks fall back and board the boat.
	More and more bugs pile in over the compound walls.

				RASCZAK
		Alright, Flores ! Levy ! Rico...!

	Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak. He falls in to his waist,
	vomits blood as something chews on him from below.

				RASCZAK
		AAAAAAAAAAAA !

				JOHNNY
		Cover us, Ace !

	Ace and the others fire from the boat. Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground
	around Rasczak. Rasczak stops screaming. They try to pull him free.

				JOHNNY
		Hit your jets, sir !

				RASCZAK
		I can't My legs are gone...
		Get on the boat...

	The compund wall collapses. A wave of bugs charges in.

				RASCZAK
		Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet.
		I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at
		the same time...

				JOHNNY
		We're not leaving you here, sir !

	Weakly, Rasczak picks up his pulse gun, checks the power.

				RASCZAK
		This is my farm. Get on the boat,
		NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.

				JOHNNY
		Give'em hell, sir !

	Johnny and Dizzy run for the boat. Rasczak opens fire, picking his shots,
	but soon the bugs are all over him.

				RASCZAK
		C'mon you sons of bitches !
		There's no bug alive can kill a
		real mAAAAAAA !

	At the boat, Dizzy turns to look back at Rasczak. A hopper swoops
	down on Dizzy, it's claws ripping into her abdomen.

				DIZZY
		AAAAAAA ! GET IT OFF ME 
		GET IT OFF GET IT OFF 
		GET IT AAAAAAAAAA !

	Johnny blows the bug off her back. Blood sprays from a deep gash in 
	her neck. Johnny picks her up, tries to stop the blood with his hand.
	The life is leaving her eyes.

				JOHNNY
		Hang on, Diz... don't die on me...

	A TANKER BUG breaches the broken wall. Ace jumps out to help his
	friends. The hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays. The boat blasts
	off, dripping metal.

147	INT	CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY

	holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting G-forces as the

				JOHNNY
		No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !

				DIZZY
		It's alright 'cause I got to have you,

	MEDICS push Johnny aside, go to work on Dizzy.

148	INT	BOAT - COCKPIT - DAY - JOHNNY

	slams into the cockpit. Out the front screen, violent bursts of BUG PLASMA
	fill the sky as they break atmosphere.

				JOHNNY
		Get on the com and tell Fleet to
		glass that rock...!

	The co-pilot turns around. It's Zander. His eyes narrow.

				ZANDER
		On whose authority, Corporal ?

				JOHNNY
		This would be mine, sir. Acting 
		Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed
		command on this mission.

	The pilot turns around. It's Carmen.

				CARMEN
		Johnny...! I thought you were dead !

				JOHNNY
		I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are.
		Glass the planet !

	Johnny leaves. Carmen punches up Fleet Command.

				CARMEN

		De Ruyter with an official request from
		the Mobile Infantery to bombard
		Planet P-11...

149	INT	BOAT - CARGO BAY - DAY - JOHNNY

	out of her mouth. Her body thrashes.

				DIZZY
		JOHNNY HEH HEH CAN'T HEH
		BREATHE GOD JOHNNY CAN'T
		HEH HEH HEH HEH...!

	Dizzy dies. A Medic slaps her. Her head lolls, mouth open, eyes blank.
	They drop her and move on to the next casualty. Johnny sits there,
	stunned. Carmen enters from the cockpit.

				CARMEN
		Negative on your request. Fleet 
		Command has the battle group 
		on standby...

		Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck.

				CARMEN
		...I'm sorry.

				JOHNNY
		We gotta choke on the mud and the
		blood and Fleet can't be bothered to
		spit.

				CARMEN
		No, I think something's up. The Sky
		Marshall's here.

	She points out for a viewing port. Johnny looks. Fifteen battle groups, 
	100 ships strong, lay off Planet P, all of them dwarfed by the Sky
	Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires.

				CARMEN
		I thought you were KIA, Johnny...

				JOHNNY
		That was just a mix up.

				CARMEN
		You look so... I don't know, you 
		look like you've really been in it.

				JOHNNY
		Dizzy bought the farm. She was my

		luck anyone gets... But in war, we must
		go on without our friends. We take
		with us their memory, and we are left
		to wonder if there is meaning in their
		death. Let me tell you what it is:
		Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep
		on fighting.

	Several INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS march into the bay.

				JOHNNY
		Officer on deck !

	Everyone snaps to attention. Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room.
	His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. He returns Johnny's salute, 
	nods to Carmen.

				CARL
		Please continue, Sergeant.

				JOHNNY
		Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd
		want us to remember her... with a
		vengeance. So go out and kill a bug 
		for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can.
		You are her revenge, and every bug 
		you kill honors her death.

	Johnny nods to the GUNNERY CREW. They load Dizzy's body into a
	tube. Johnny steps back, salutes Dizzy. Everyone salutes.

				JOHNNY
		Womb to tomb, cap trooper !

				ROUGHNECKS
		Womb to tomb !

	The CREW CHIEF fires the tube. Out the viewports, A PULSE OF LIGHT 
	disperses into space. The Roughnecks file out. Carl approaches.
	Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the hand.

				CARMEN
		Well, look at this. The three of us back
		together again.

				JOHNNY
		How are you, Carl ?

				CARL
		Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your
		unit on Planet P. That mission had
		a very low survival probability...

				JOHNNY
		Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?

				CARL
		Elegant proof of intelligence, 
		isn't it ? We thought there might
		be a brain on P.

				CARMEN
		You knew and you sent them
		anyway ?

				CARL
		A colony has to reach a certain size
		before it produces a Brain... we think
		300 generations. Woulda too expensive
		to launch an operation if there wasn't a
		Brain...

	Carl sees the way Carmen is looking at him, like he's a bug.

				CARL
		You don't approve. Well, too bad.
		We're in this for the species, boys
		and girls. It's simple numbers, they
		have more, and everyday I have to
		make decisions that send hundreds of
		people like you to their deaths.

				JOHNNY
		Didn't they tell you, Colonel ?
		That's what cap troopres are good
		for.

	Carl allows himself a tiny smile.

				CARL
		Hope you're ready for more. We're
		going back to P to capture that Brain.

				JOHNNY
		The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

				CARL
		I hear they need a new Lieutenant...
		Want the job ?

				JOHNNY
		I'll take it... until I get killed
		or you find someone better.

	KLAXONS sound. Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.

				CARMEN
		Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl.

				CARL
		It's good to see you two. It reminds
		me of the way things were before...

	Carl turns abruptly and heads away. His entourage follows.

				CARMEN
		Take care, wilya Johnny ?

				JOHNNY
		See you on the bounce !

153	INT	RODGER YOUNG - COMMAND & CONTROL - CARMEN

	steps onto the bridge. There's a new NUMBER 2 sitting in Zander's chair.
	She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared. 
	Carmen turns to Captain Deladier.

				CARMEN
		Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?

				DELADIER
		He requested a combat assignment.
		There's always a need for experienced
		pilots on the ground.
		I had no choice but to let him go...
		He said you'd understand.

	Carmen bites her lip, takes first chair. Deladier feels bad for her, knows
	she's made a painful decision.

154	INT	RODGER YOUNG - DROP ROOM - ROUGHNECKS

	are suiting up. Ace enters.

				ACE
		Officer on the deck !

	Roughnecks fall in. Johnny steps into the room. There are many new and
	much younger faces.

				JOHNNY
		I only have two rules. Rule one,
		everyone fights. Rule two, no one
		quits. If you don't do your job,
		I'll kill you myself.
		Do you get me ?

				ROUGHNECKS
		We get you, sir !

				JOHNNY
			(to Ace, sotto voce)
		Who're all these kids ?

				ACE
		We got reinforced. Most of'em
		just got outa boot...

				JOHNNY
		We're the old men, Ace.

155	EXT	PLANET P - 4TH BRIGADE HQ - DAY - CARGO SHIPS

	have landed. Cap troopers set fire to huge piles of dead bugs. BULLDOZERS
	push bodies into a mass grave, among them Rasczak. 
	Johnny walks past with his team.

				JOHNNY
		We'll take this high ground. Lookouts
		there and therte and up there. If the
		bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood,
		we'll be the first to know.

				ACE
		Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know
		where they can deploy the skimmers.

				JOHNNY
		Down there on the flats, eh ?
		Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our
		primary objective is to assist
		our friends from the Fleet...

	Roughnecks boo.

				JOHNNY
		Alright, cut it out. We will deploy
		from skimmers in teams of six.
		If the bugs open up a battery,
		we put it out of business.
		Any questions ?

	A HERCULES CARGO BOAT hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high
	ground Johnny has intended forb his H.Q. Johnny scowls, marches over
	to the boat and confronts a FLEET OFFICER.

				JOHNNY
		Would'ya mind moving your boat ?

				FLEET OFFICER
		Better talk to the boss.

	The cargo bays open to deploy FLEET SKIMMERS. Zander jumps down
	to oversee the operation.

				JOHNNY
		You're standing on my H.Q., 
		Lieutenant !

				ZANDER 
		This is a Fleet-driven operation, son,
		and the Fleet thinks my boat will be 
		safer on the high ground.
		You can have everything else, eh ?

				JOHNNY
		You heard the Sky Marshall...
		Move it all down -

	Suddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty.
	Zander and Johnny share a look of concern.

				ZANDER
		Rodger Young, prepare to receice 
		outgoing fire...!
			(to his crew chief)
		I'll take the first group.

				JOHNNY
		Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !

156	EXT	SPACE - PLANET P ORBIT - BUG PLASMA

	begins to take a toll on the battle group as the orbiting ships lay their eggs.
	Cap Troopers are scliced as they drop.

157	EXT	RODGER YOUNG - BRIDGE - CAPTAIN DELADIER

	turns to Carmen.

				DELADIER
		Evasive action !

	Carmen dodges other starships, turns to her new number 2.

				CARMEN
		Prepare for warp !

				NEW NUMBER 2
		Yes, ma'am ! Warp in 5... 4...
		3...!

	KA-WHAM ! The Rodger Young takes a direct hit.

158	EXT	RODGER YOUNG - PLANET P ORBIT - THE RODGER YOUNG

	is cut in two. The rear section explodes, the forward section begins to burn towards
	the bridge.

159	INT	RODGER YOUNG - BRIDGE - CAPTAIN DELADIER

	calmy evacuates the bridge. Power fails and so does the gravity.

				CARMEN
		This is Rodger Young, we're going
		down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young,
		we're going down...!

				DELADIER
		Ibanez...LET'S GO !

160	INT	RODGER YOUNG - ESCAPE CORRIDOR - CARMEN

	and Captain Deladier run for the lifepods. An explosion flips the corridor.
	Captain Deladier's leg is crushed when an airlock closes on her.

				DELADIER
		AAAAAAAAAAA !

	Carmen hits the release, pulls her free. Deladier pushes Carmen away.

				DELADIER
		Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !

				CARMEN
		No way, ma'am !

161	INT	RODGER YOUNG - LIFE POD BAY - CARMEN

	pushes into the chaotic life pod bay. PANICKED CREW shoving, screaming,
	fighting. The ship pitches. They tumble, landing near a pod. Carmen jumps
	for it, pulls Deladier in after.

162	EXT	RODGER YOUNG - PLANET P ORBIT - THE RODGER YOUNG

	disintegrates as lifepods shoot away toward the planet.

163	INT	LIFEPOD - PLANET P ORBIT - CARMEN

	navigates through a graveyard of floating wreckage, dead cap troopers,
	someone's trombone. She sets her beacon and the pod plummets 
	downward.

				CARMEN
		Mayday, mayday ! This is 
		Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez in 
		lifepod RY63... I'm going in...

164	EXT	PLANET P - BASE CAMP - DAY - ROUGHNECKS

	board the Skimmers. Zander approaches Johnny, upset.

				JOHNNY
		What's your problem now,
		Lieutenant ?

				ZANDER 
		The Rodger Young just burned up...

	Johnny's face falls.

				JOHNNY
		Any survivors ?

	Zander points. Far in the distance, a glowing pod plummets toward the planet.
	Johnny tracks it on his "head up".

165	INT	LIFEPOD - ATMOSPHERE - DAY - CARMEN

	is shaken violently as the pod hits atmosphere.

166	EXT	PLANET P - DAY - CARMEN'S POD

	hits and goes straight through the crust of Planet P.

167	INT	BUG CITY TUNNELS - DAY - THE POD

	comes to rest. Carmen blows the hatch, pulls Deladier out, grabs a Morita
	pulse rifle. Tunnels lead in every direction.

				CARMEN
		This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez.
		Is anyone receiving ?

168	EXT	BASE CAMP - DAY - JOHNNY

	grabs the handset from Ace.

				JOHNNY (O.S.)
		Affirmative ! Carmen, this is Roughneck
		base camp... What is your present 
		location ?

169	INT	BUG CITY TUNNELS - DAY - CARMEN

	sees a warrior coming at her from out of the shadows. Carmen fires a burst
	and kills it. Now there are two. Carmen backs up firing, but there are 
	too many.

				CARMEN
		My present location is 42 degrees 
		South by 176 degrees East...
		situation is extremely hostile...
		I...AAAAAAAAA !
	
	They have her. She puts the barrel of the Morita in her mouth, but a claw 
	cut her trigger finger off at the knuckle.

170	EXT	PLANET P - ROUGHNECK BASE CAMP - DAY - JOHNNY

	and Zander are horrified by what they hear.

				CARMEN (O.S.)
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !

				JOHNNY
		We've gotta go get her !

				ZANDER
		You know as well as I do she's
		probably already dead.

	Johnny knows it's true, swallows bitterly, turns away. That's when he sees it. 
	Nearby, the ground shifts, a claw breaks through, a hole opens up and bugs
	boil up out of the ground.

				SUGAR WATKINS
		Here they come !

	They turn and see a second bug hole open up.

				JOHNNY
		We're outa here. Lieutenant, get
		your men into the skimmers. This
		real estate's about to go buggy.

				ZANDER
		Hey, just calm down, I'm giving
		the orders here-

	The entire area underneath the base camp collapses to form a huge new
	canyon. The Hercules boat topples, crushing Skimmers and unfortunate
	Fleet personnnel.

171	EXT	NEW CANYON - DAY - JOHNNY

	and the surviving Roughnecks pick themselves up. The are now 30 meters
	below the planet's surface. Above them, bugs line the wide rim of the
	newly formed canyon.

				JOHNNY
		Form a perimeter !

	Through the dust, exposed bug tunnels can be seen in the canyon walls and
	piling out of them by the score, deadly Arachnid warriors. Johnny throws
	Zander a pulse cannon.

				JOHNNY
		Make yourself useful, fly boy...
		PREPARE TO REPEL BUGS !

	The Roughnecks open fire at the charging bug horde. Warriors are blown to 
	pieces. Gas grenades fly and H.E. rounds close tunnels. A maimed warrior 
	gets through and heads for Zander.

				ZANDER
		AAAAAAAAAAA !

	Johnny and Ace team up to blow it away. Zander takes a deep breath,
	loos around, impressed. The Roughnecks have killed a great many bugs.

				JOHNNY
		Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we
		need retrieval... Sugar, salvage some
		armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow.

	Sugar Watkins tosses a bloody jump boot his way.

				ZANDER
		Thanks.

				ACE
		Fleet Command says retrieval's no go.
		The battle group's at safe distance...
		and we got another problem.

	Ace points out a Tanker bug that's been brough up to the rim. 
	Johnny sees another.

				JOHNNY
		Looks like they're gonna hose us down...

	Johnny chews on this.

				JOHNNY
		Alright... Listen up, Roughnecks.
		We're gonna head west down through
		bug city, pick up any Rodger Young 
		survivors we run across, and join A
		Company. Get me ?

				ROUGHNECKS
		We get you, sir !

	Zander, awkward in a power suit, confronts Johnny.

				ZANDER
		What do you think you're doing ?

				JOHNNY
		I'm gonna save Carmen.

				ZANDER
		That would mean a comlete disregard
		for the mission objective. They hang
		you for that, Rico.

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, that's right.

	Johnny and Zander stare each other down.

				ZANDER
		Let's go.
		
				JOHNNY
		Move out.

	Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and
	the others fall in behind him.

				ACE
		Bug hunt !

				ROUGHNECKS
		BUG HUNT !

172	INT	TUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY

	leads his deadly force through enemy territory. The Roughnecks kill
	everything that gets in their way. Zander lends his inexperienced hand.

				JOHNNY
		Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't
		waste it on workers...
		Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our
		way...

				ACE
		Yes, sir !

	Warriors appear in the tunnel behind them.

				JOHNNY
		Sugar, close the tunnel...!

				SUGAR
		Fire in the hole !

	Sugar Watkins fires an H.E. round and seals the tunnel.

173	INT	BUG CITY - FEEDING PIT - DAY - CARMEN

	opens her eyes. She can hear BUGS CLICKING. She's in a pit filled 
	with human dead. A nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade
	Off in the dark she hears HUMAN MOANING.

	She crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound. The moaning turns
	to SCREAMING. It's coming from outside the pit. She pulls herself
	up to peer over the edge. 

174	INT	BUG CITY - THE ROYAL COURT - DAY - CARMEN

	sees hundred of bugs at work, WARRIORS, WORKERS and dozens of 
	small (2 meters) CHARIOT BUGS. Aworker walks pas, stepping on her,
	but pays her no attention.

	She sees the source of the screaming:	Captain Deladier is hold
	between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees,

				DELADIER
		NAAAAAAAA...! OH PLEASE...

	The BRAIN BUG is huge (5 meters) and pulpy. I has vestigial legs that
	cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of
	chariot bugs.

				DELADIER
		...OH GOD AAAAAAAAAAAAA...!

	A thorn-like PALP unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes, driving deep into
	Deladier's head and sucks her brains out.

				DELADIER
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Carmen watches horrified as Deladier dies. The suddenly a warrior grabs her
	from above and drags her out of the pit. She screams as its claws slice into 
	her limbs.

				CARMEN
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	Now the brain bug comes for her. She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like
	spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape.
	All she wants to do is die.

	Suddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen. Carmen hears it.
	A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. 
	Johnny enters the chamber alone.

	The warriors move toward him. He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched
	tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks.
	The warriors freeze.

				JOHNNY
		You know what this is...?

	Johnny makes an explosive sound. The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp.

				JOHNNY
		Sure you do... You're a big fat smart
		bug, aren't you ?

	Johnny moves toward Carmen. The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him.
	The warriors holding Carmen threaten. Johnny turns on the brain bug, 
	his finger on the nuke's trigger. 

				JOHNNY
		I'll take you with me.

	The Brain Bug clicks. The warriors back off. Carmen collapses.
	Johnny reaches for her.

				JOHNNY
		Take my hand !

	Chariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole. Workers seal the hole
	behind it with amazing speed. Johnny drags Carmen back toward the 
	tunnel he entered from. The warriors charge.

				JOHNNY
		Roughnecks...NOW !

	Johnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into
	the chamber, guns blazing. The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to
	bug and Roughneck alike. 

	Sugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off. Zander takes a
	claw through the gut.

				ZANDER
		AAAAAAAAAAAAA !

	He blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves
	them back inside and keeps on fighting. A warrior rears up over Johnny
	and Carmen.

				JOHNNY
		Weapon !

	Ace throws him a Morita. Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the 
	bug's nerve stem. He struggles out from under the dead warrior.
	Every bug in the chamber is dead.

				JOHNNY
		Are you hurt ?

	Carmen throws her arms around Johnny.

				CARMEN
		Johnny...!

	Zander takes this in. Carmen sees him, then his wound.

				CARMEN
		Zander...! Oh, you're hurt.

	Ace takes a look at his wound, makes a face.

				ACE
		Ah geez...

	Zander pushes him away, struggles to his feet.

				JOHNNY
		Can you walk ?

				ZANDER
			(clenched teeth)
		Not a problem.

				JOHNNY
		Let's get some armor on her, and
		the we'll get outa this stinkin 
		bug hole !

	Various components are gladly passed forward. Johnny and Ace 
	help her putting it on.

				CARMEN
		I thought I was dead. Lucky for
		me you jokers showed up, eh ?

				ZANDER
		It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the
		mission objective to rescue you...

				CARMEN
		Is it true ?

				JOHNNY
		Yeah, if I live through this, 
		they'll probably hang me.
		Now com'on, let's move out !

175	INT	BUG CITY TUNNELS - DAY - THE ROUGHNECKS

	double-time it, racing for the surface. They come to a fork.

				CARMEN
		Which way ?

				JOHNNY
		Up. We gotta be near A Company 
		by now.

	The tunnel floor drops out. FIVE ROUGHNECKS disappear into the hole.
	WARRIORS climb up into the tunnel.

				JOHNNY
		FALL BACK !

	The Roughnecks bachk up fast, shooting. Zander staggers, collapses.
	Johnny drops to his side, rolls him over.

				JOHNNY
		How bad are you, pal ?

				ZANDER
		Been better, buddy.

	Johnny sees warriors coming up into the tunnel by the score.

				JOHNNY
		Alright, we're gonna carry you...

				ZANDER
		Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get 
		upstairs before it's too late...
		Gimmee the nuke.

	Zander checks his pulse cannon's available power.

				JOHNNY
		Don't be a hero...

				ZANDER
		This is my farm. Now c'mon, give
		me what you got and get out of
		here...

	Johnny nods, hands him the nuke. Carmen sees what's happening.

				CARMEN
		Zander, what are you doing ?

				ZANDER
		Just giving you something to
		remember me by, baby.

				CARMEN
		Zander, no...!

	He grabs her and kisses her. Johnny drags Carmen away. Zander opens 
	fire as the first warriors reach his position.

176	INT	BUG CITY - INCLINED TUNNEL - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	race desperately for the surface. They hear the chatter of Zander's pulse cannon
	and the screams of dying bugs.

				JOHNNY
		GO.GO GO GO GO...!

	Tears stream down from Carmen's face.

177	EXT	PLANET P - DAY - JOHNNY AND CARMEN

	and the surviving Roughnecks make it to the surface. 	WOMP !
	A subterrenean nuclear explosion blows a column of earth and stone
	into the air.

178	EXT	PLANET P - A COMPANY BASE CAMP - JOHNNY

	and the others enter A Company's perimeter. No one notices their arrival
	because everyone's gathered in a big circle watching the Brain Bug.

				CARMEN
		Look... they got it.

	Several of its delicate legs were apparently broken during the capture.
	Carl approaches it without fear, puts his hand on the thing.

				GENERAL
		What's it thinking, Colonel ?

	Carl smiles in a cruel way.

				CARL
		It's afraid.

	Johnny and Carmen approach the General.

				JOHNNY
		Sir, I'd like to turn myself in.
		Dereliction of duty by an officer
		during wartime.

				GENERAL
		And you freely admit to it ?

				JOHNNY
		Yes, sir.

				GENERAL
		Is what this man says true,
		Lieutenant ?

				CARMEN
		To the best of my understanding,

    from a story by James Cameron

    AUGUST 11, 1993

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    1:06 AM DEC 30, 1999

    Blackness.  We hear:

                             VOICE
              Ready?

                             SECOND VOICE (LENNY)
              Yeah.  Boot it.

    A burst of bright white static exploding across the
    darkness.  A high whine on the audio track gives way to
    street sounds and rapid breathing.

    AN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV.  We're in a
    car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view
    swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the
    windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front
    seat.

    Our POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in "our"
    hands.  A red LED is flashing.  We slip the recorder into
    a coat pocket.

                             OUR VOICE
              Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.

    The guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose
    over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask.
    He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off.

                             LANE
              Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for
              waitin' till I get this fuckin thing
              on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or
              what?

    He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it.
    Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up
    over our field of view.

    We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video.

    WE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS.  Real honest-to-God point of
    view, with no cuts, no music.  This is not film, it is
    human experience.

    The driver is a Hispanic guy named "SPAZ" DIAZ.  Lane is a
    white guy who looks very strung out.  Couple of
    crackheads.  The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald
    with primer.

                             LANE
              Next alley... just pull in slow.
                      (turning to us)
              Hurry up will ya.  Here.

    He hands us a big stainless steel revolver.  The POV looks
    down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the
    rounds, snap it closed.

    Diaz pulls the barge into an alley.  The headlights
    illuminate overflowing dumpsters.  A Chicano busboy is
    making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which
    he has chocked open.  The busboy goes back inside.

                             LANE
              Let's go.

    Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our
    ears.  We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now.
    Through the door, after Lane, moving fast.

    Into the kitchen.  Fluorescent glare.  The busboy turning,
    surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face.  Freezing
    him.  Lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any
    language.

    Our hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face.  We get
    them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with
    the shotgun.  He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the
    front room.

    We hear voices as we approach the swing door.  Go through.

    Whip pan left, then right.  Scoping the layout.  Low-rent
    THAI place.  Red wallpaper.  Closing time.  Middle-aged
    Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money.  Young
    Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up.  They look up, stunned, as we
    put the gun on them.

                             OUR VOICE
                      (shouting, edgy)
              Don't move, don't talk, don't do
              nothing.

    Our POV is whipping around, from the front door to the
    owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway
    covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he
    steps back from the cash-register.

    We scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred
    bucks in tens and fives.

    Now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the
    kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy
    Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up.

    Into the walk-in cooler.  The steel door closes on four
    scared pair of eyes.  POV looking around, seeing... a
    dish-rack.  Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon
    handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch.  Locking
    them in.

    Lane heading out the back door.  Laughing, as he looks at
    the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him.
    We follow Lane to the car.  Snap a look down the alley one
    way, then the other.

    Shit!  Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the
    alley.  Heartbeat goes triple time.  Scrambling into the
    car.

    Door not even closed and SPAZ has it in reverse, burning
    rubber as he launches back down the alley.
    SCRUNCH!  The car grinds along one wall as SPAZ steers
    wildly backward.  Sparks right next to us.  Then--
    KBOOM!  As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out
    into the street.

    The cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us
    as SPAZ cranks the wheel and punches it down the street.
    He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between
    cars.  We pull off the stocking to see better.

    The cop car surges onto the street behind us.

    Looking ahead.  A red light.  Cars stopped, blocking the
    way.  Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the
    cars, into the intersection.

    A near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating.
    Another red light ahead.

                             LANE
              Don't stop!

    Truck entering the intersection.  Everyone yelling.  SPAZ
    cuts the wheel but too late...

    Clipping the truck and spinning.
    The street outside smearing past like the view from a
    Tilt-a-whirl.

    Then KBLAM!  Hitting something, God-knows-what, and
    launching up and over, and--

    KRUNCH!  Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass.

    It gets quiet and still.  Tinkling glass as Lane moves.
    Then SPAZ is screaming.  The car is upside down.

    Crawling out of the side window.  A frenzy now.
    Whip pan to see the cops pulling up.

    Then whipping back to the wreck.  The engine is burning.
    Flames spreading rapidly.  SPAZ inside, pinned, upside
    down, blood pumping across his face.

    Our hands pulling Lane out.  He comes up running.

    We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness
    of an alley.

    Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody
    yelling.
    Gunshots.  Looking back.  Cops next to their car, firing.
    Ahead, Lane running into shadow.

    Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor.
    Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding
    the door open as we dive through into--

    A stairwell.  Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time.
    Trying the door at the second floor landing.  Locked.
    Shit.

    Running up.  Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up.

    The POV is finally broken by a...

                                                 CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE

    But we don't know where we are yet.  We see a man in
    extreme close-up: just his eyes and mouth.  The eyes are
    closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is
    watching a movie in there.  This is LENNY.

                             LENNY
              This is great... the doors are all
              locked.  Who are these losers,
              friends of yours?

                                                 CUT TO:

    BACK TO POV as we reach the fifth floor landing.  Lane is
    coming unglued as he finds this door locked.  We look
    down, see cops coming two floors below.  One cranks off a
    couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing.
    Pounding up the last flight.  Finally!  The door is
    unlocked.

    Blasting through it, behind Lane, onto the roof.  Running
    all out past AC units and pipes, air vents.  Looking up:
    an LAPD helicopter orbiting close.  It flicks the xenon
    onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue
    daylight.

    Running along the edge of the roof.  Looking down.  Car
    burning upside down in the street below.  The gas tank
    explodes, filling the street with orange light.  We don't
    slow.  We're running all out.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.
              Oh, oh, end of the line boys.

    Ahead, in POV we see the edge of the roof coming up.
    Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and
    separated by a 20 foot alley.

    But Lane doesn't slow down.  He leaps across the void and
    makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl.
    We reach the edge and look down.  Six stories.  No ladders
    or fire-escapes.  Whip to behind us.  Cops running across
    the roof.

                             LANE
              Come on!  Fucking jump man!

    The POV backs up from the edge and then runs toward it...
    Out into the void.  Moving... airborne... then...
    WHAM!  Right into the parapet wall.

    Slipping down.  Brick wall right in our face.  Bloody
    fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along
    the edge.

    Looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop.
    A cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below,
    oblivious.
    Breathing raspy.  Snapping a look up as the pipe gives
    way.
    A keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up
    but...
    Snapping a look down--
    Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy
    scream--
    Ground rushing up--

    Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and
    running out of the way as--
    Pavement fills frame.  A burst of violent red light.
    Sound like a gunshot... but no echo.

    Only silence.  And blackness.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE

    Lit by miles of fluorescent.  Empty and echoing.  Close on
    Lenny.  He has something on his head.  Something that
    looks like a mutated set of Walkman headphones, except
    they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples
    and over the forehead.  PLAYBACK "TRODES".  Lenny whips
    off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in
              snuff.  How many times I hafta tell
              you?!

    Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "TICK", a pale-
    skinned creature of the night in T-shirt and leather
    jacket.  Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground
    of the near future.

                             TICK
              Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Well you could've at least warned
              me.  You know I hate the zap... when
              they die.  It just brings down your
              whole day.  Jeez, Tick.

                             TICK
              Sorry.

    LENNY NERO is low thirties.  Handsome.  Charming.  And you
    better check to see if you still have your ring after you
    shake with him.  He is wearing an expensive Italian
    jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie." His Rolex
    isn't real.  His greasy hair is too long and curls around
    his collar.  He needs to shave.  A little sleazy.  But he
    has energy, and heavy street smarts.

    Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 BMW 1035i.  Tick
    is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit
    70's van.  There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled
    inside the van.  Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to
    him, like a drug dealer.  In fact the whole setup looks
    like a drug deal, but it's not.  Though it is illegal.
    The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes,
    and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals.  They
    are about the size of DAT tapes, and hold about 30 minutes
    of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears,
    and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at
    the moment it is happening.

                             LENNY
              How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't
              the cops put it in evidence?

                             TICK
              With all the blood I guess they
              didn't see the rig.  Guy had it
              under a wig.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, but how'd it get to you?

                             TICK
              I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.
                      (off Lenny's impatient
                       look)
              Okay, okay... I got a deal with some
              a the paramedics.  My guy pages me
              and I pick it up at the morgue.  So
              whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be
              worth at least a grand.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I
              don't deal this kind of product, you
              know that.  I'll give you four for
              it, cause I've gotta cut off the
              last bit.  And my customers want
              uncut.

                             TICK
              Fuck that!  The last part's the
              best.  You dry-dive six stories and
              blammo!  Jack right into the Big
              Black.

                             LENNY
              I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's
              policy.  I got ethics here.

                             TICK
              Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,
              man!  It's what people want to see,
              and you know it.

                             LENNY
              So lay it off to somebody else.

                             TICK
              Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I
              got to get this rig fixed.  Look at
              it...

    Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized
    stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record
    deck we saw earlier in the POV.  Also in the bag is the
    SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the
    human head (this is different from playback trodes).  The
    whole works are covered with congealed blood.

                             TICK
              Give me six at least.  This's a good
              clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, well, the first part's okay.
              Better than the usual soaps you
              bring me.

                             TICK
              Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always
              bring you choice.

    Lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet,
    pulling out a tape.

                             LENNY
              Sure, like this low-grade shit here,
              some girl in a fight with her
              boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.
              Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.

                             TICK
              Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me
              real life.  Bring me street life.
              And, like, one man's mundane and
              desperate existence is another man's
              Technicolor.'

                             LENNY
              I said that?  Look, I'll take it for
              five, and you'll make out okay,
              because in this case it's pure
              cream, you don't have to cut
              anything back to the wearer.

                             TICK
              Ha!  That's for fucking sure.

                             LENNY
              What else you got?

                                                CUT TO:

    MONTAGE/SERIES OF SHOTS

    Lenny in his BMW, driving through the LA streets.
    Streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a
    calligraphy of light.  Lenny works the cellular, gets
    messages on his DIGITAL PAGER, weaves in and out of
    traffic -- punches the buttons on his radio, changing
    stations all the time.  Raw, nervous energy: like a kid
    who can't stay still.  It's a hard hustle in the big food
    chain.

                             LENNY
              Look, Jerr.  I'm nothing if not a
              man of my word.  I'll drop the money
              by tomorrow, next day latest.  It's
              a little crazed right now.  Yeah, on
              my mother's eyes, I swear.  Thanks,
              buddy.
                      (hangs up)
              Prick.
                      (to the car ahead
                       honking)
              What kinda move you call that?!
              Lemmings.

    Lenny turns up the radio.  SELECTED DRIVE-BY IMAGES, as
    the talk-radio provides commentary.

    Lenny's car passing under glowing Santa Clauses on the
    light-poles.  Banners proclaiming the coming "Millennium
    LA" festivities.

                             TALK-RADIO HOST
              ... it's a little after 2 am on
              December 30th, 1999... the second to
              last day of the whole darn century,
              and the phone lines are open.  Dan
              from Silverlake, you're on the air.

    Transition to a rougher section of town.  Buildings roll
    by endlessly, tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns.
    some are burnt-out ruins.

                             DAN FROM SILVERLAKE
              Uh, hi.

                             HOST
              So Dan, are you looking forward to
              the New Year?

    A building is burning out of control.  In the foreground,
    silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus-bench.

                             DAN
              Not really.  I mean what's the
              point?  Nothing changes New Years
              day.  The economy sucks, gas is over
              three bucks a gallon, fifth grade
              kids are shooting each other at
              recess... the whole thing sucks,
              right?  So what the hell are we
              celebrating?

    A shanty-camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass.
    Homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants.  Their lives
    in shopping carts.

                             HOST
              You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of
              guy, aren't you Dan?  Well I for one
              happen to think that us making it
              2000 years is worth celebrating--

    Lenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and MUSIC
    blasts.  Something fast... a rap-metal hybrid.  Anger and
    energy.

    WE CUT IN fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic
    weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the
    streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting
    people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance,
    Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by
    a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter.
    Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic
    neighborhood.

    BACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous
    businessman.  We don't hear the conversation.  MUSIC OVER.
    Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a
    squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit
    jacket.  Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away.
    Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the
    number.

    ON LENNY DRIVING.

    Ahead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint.
    The cops have thrown a block across the street and are
    shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through.
    Lenny slaps his ID against the side window with one hand,
    not missing a beat in his conversation.  This is just part
    of life in LA.

                             LENNY
                      (on cellular)
              Jimbo.  I'm there, Jimmy.  Right now,
              can't you hear me knockin'?

    CUT TO LENNY working his way through a crowded club, music
    pounding.  Strobe lights.  We don't see much.  He hears
    his phone rings and pulls the tiny DIGITAL CELLULAR out of
    his breast pocket.  Sticks a finger in his other ear and
    answers.

    CUT TO LENNY, back in the BMW, on the streets.  On the
    move.

                             LENNY
              -- so you line up the talent, shoot
              the clip, get it to me by Monday.
              OK?  Client wants a guy and two
              girls, the guy wears... yeah, I
              know, thinks he's being original.
              Girls have to be young.  So don't
              use your mother like you usually do.
              Yeah, you too, pendejo.  And no big
              tits... French tits.  That's it...
              like Champagne glasses... you got
              it.  What a pro.  Page me.

    LENNY PULLS UP to the security checkpoint of a gated
    community.  The white upper-middle class hiding behind
    walls and paid security.

                             LORI
              If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd
              know that there won't be another
              thousand years.  Right now we are in
              the Last Days, as foretold in the
              book of--

                             HOST
              The Last Days?  You mean the coming
              of the Apocalypse, right?  The
              Rapture?

    Lenny fishes around in the glove compartment, flipping
    through about twenty plastic security passes for different
    parts of town, all bogus.  He finds the right one and
    flips it onto the dash.

                             LORI
              Yes, that's right.  You only have to
              look at the signs... there are wars
              and rumors of wars--

    The RENT A COP at the guardshack hits him with his light.

                             LENNY
                      (lying)
              I live here.

    The cop waves him through.  Lenny is the right color.

                             HOST
              Now just so the rest of us know how
              much time is left, when is the
              Rapture supposed to hit, exactly?
              Is it midnight New Year's Eve?

    And WE CUT to a burst of news videotape, enlarged, noisy,
    distorted... images of a great gathering in the desert,
    the faithful waiting for God's sign as the millennium
    approaches.

                             HOST
              Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern
              Standard or what?  I mean, what time
              zone is God in, anyway?

                             LORI
              I pray for you all.

    Lenny's BMW cruises past an overturned burning car.  There
    is no-one around.  He barely glances at it.  Common sight
    these days.  If it is the end of the world, Lenny's not
    going to let it break his rhythm.

                             LENNY

              I just got something in, Bobby, you
              might appreciate.  A 211 at a Thai
              joint goes south, and these three
              scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run.
              It's a beauty, two thumbs up.
              Parental discretion advised.  I'm
              talking it's the master, not some
              stepped-on copy.  One of a kind.

    LENNY INSIDE A GLOOMY BAR.  He slides into a booth with
    NORM SKINNER, a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses
    too young.  A pretty, stoned-looking girl is leaning
    against Skinner.

                             LENNY
              Yo, Skinner.  The Skin Man.
                      (fingering his
                       jacket)
              Red leather.  Nice feminine touch.

                             SKINNER
                      (laughing)
              Fuck you, Nero.

                             LENNY
              Whattya got for me?

    CUT TO: POV of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy.
    Lovemaking in point-of-view.  We look down, see OUR BODY,
    a woman's body... our hands moving over the other woman's
    torso.  The image is dark, a primal impression.  Sound of
    harsh breathing, rustling sheets.

    BACK TO LENNY in the booth with Skinner.  Lenny has
    Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his
    belt, next to his pager.  He is hunched over the table,
    "sampling" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode
    pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset.
    Like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, I can use this...
                      (to the stoned girl)
              ... but honey you gotta move your
              eyes slower next time.  It's too
              jerky.

                             SKINNER
              It was her first time, Lenny.  Cut
              her some slack.

    NEWS FOOTAGE: LAPD Aerospatiales circling, their xenon

    INSIDE THE COCKPIT, the infrared camera shows green-screen
    images of people in cars, in their homes... like footage
    of hyenas shot at night in total darkness.

    The impression is of a society under siege, an occupied

    police spotlight define our reality.

              Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down
              with 2-K.

    CRASH Unit cops with a bunch of Salvadoran gang kids
    racked up against a storefront.  A dozen 16 year-old girls
    and guys, hands against the wall, acting bored, as the
    cops walk up and down, reading IDs.

                             HOST
              2-K?  What's that DeWayne?

    A group of cops have two black guys proned out.  Nearby a
    crowd jeers, shouting insults.  A black kid throws a beer
    bottle and one of the cops chases him into the crowd.

                             DEWAYNE
              2-K.  The big two thousand.  Comin

              new, make it our own.  History gonna
              start right here, right now--

    LENNY cuts him off as his cellular call connects.

                             LENNY
              Hi, Dave, this is Lenny.
                      (pause)
              Nero.  Lenny Nero.  That's right.
              Oh, is it late?  Sorry.  It's just
              that I have something that might be
              of interest, and since I always call
              you first--
                      (pause)
              Uh, huh.  Well, what would be a good
              time?  Okay, sure.  Catch you then.

                                                CUT TO:

    A GAME ARCADE.  Light and noise as the customers drop
    quarters for synthetic thrills.  Lenny is talking to a
    nice-looking street kid in his early 20's named EDUARDO.

                             EDUARDO
              Let me get this straight... you
              gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a
              hair net and bang some beautiful
              babe.  I don't know, I gotta think
              about this.

    Lenny smiles and pulls out a SQUID-net.  He motions
    Eduardo into the shadows.

                             LENNY
              Okay, let's get you wired up.  I
              hope this axle grease you got in
              your hair doesn't screw up the squid
              receptors.

                             EDUARDO
              What's all this squid shit?

    As Lenny works, fitting the network of sensors over
    Eduardo's head, he holds class.

                             LENNY
              Superconducting QUantum Interference
              Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's
              gonna be a test.

                             EDUARDO
              Hey, fuck you, man.

                             LENNY
              Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a
              sense of humor at all times.  Okay,
              the receptor rig... what I'm putting
              on your head... sends a signal to
              the recorder.
                      (Lenny holds up the
                       recorder)
              See we call it "being wired," but
              there's no wire.  You gotta keep the
              recorder close... five, six feet
              away max, like in your jacket pocket
              by the bed or wherever you're going
              to close escrow, know what I mean?

                             EDUARDO
              Yeah, right.

    Lenny fits a wig from his briefcase over Eduardo's head,
    turning him into a headbanger.  Eduardo scowls at this
    set-back to his suavete.

                             LENNY
              Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes
              around.  Don't look in the mirror or
              you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a
              half hour of tape, so give me some
              lead-in to the main event.  But
              don't wait too long, I don't want to
              be going out for popcorn.  And don't
              act natural.  Don't act at all.
              Just forget the thing is on.  Got
              it?

                             EDUARDO
              No problem.

                             LENNY
              A star is born.

    EXT.  TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

    A woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train
    track at night.  The woman has no shoes, her feet bare.

    IRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe
    pointlessly to her chest.  She is swearing and crying,
    runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale
    face.  Despite this we see that she is attractive, though
    her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt
    sexiness.  Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane
    of curly red hair.

    She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her
    life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks
    lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath
    comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild.

    She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking
    behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling.
    Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over
    the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car
    as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees
    an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the
    yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on.

    She continues her run, moving away from the direction of
    the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying,
    she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her
    dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She
    crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of
    sight.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALLEY AND STREET - NIGHT

    Iris sprints down an alley between buildings.  Rats
    scatter into the shadows ahead of her.  She doesn't seem
    to notice.  All she cares about are the police lights, and
    the sound of the helicopter droning, circling.

    She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well-
    lit street beyond.  There are people here: downtown low-
    life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit
    sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station.

    She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign,
    feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding.
    She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely
    glance at her.

    LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes
    and boots of winter.

    SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a
    black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block,
    behind her.

    IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street.
    They look intense.  Revved up.  They are BURDEN SPREG, a
    massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties,
    and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twenties
    with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a
    ferret.

                             ENGELMAN
              She's a hooker, vice'll have her in
              the book.  We can pick her up later.

                             SPREG
              No.  Now.

    IRIS knows the cops are behind her.  She is terrified to
    turn.  Finally she can't stand it any more.  She breaks
    into a run.  The patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring
    after her.

    Iris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track
    runner.  The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to
    her and the cops jump out.

    Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full-
    tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose
    groceries go flying.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  SUBWAY STATION AND TRAIN

    Iris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the
    filthy tile floor, and comes up running.  Panting with
    fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a
    hurdler.

    The cops pound down the stairs two at a time.  Spreg draws
    his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness...
    a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey.

    Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them.
    They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop
    and his boy wonder.

    The two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight.

    MOVING WITH THEM as they slow to a walk, scanning.  A
    couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains,
    eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover.

                             DISPATCHER (V.O.)
              Do you request back-up?

                             SPREG
              Negative.  Suspect is a black male,
              age 35 to 40.  We're handling it.

    A train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air.  A
    few people board.  There is only the sound of the cops'
    footsteps as they move along the empty platform.  With a
    pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close.

    Suddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a
    full sprint.  Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes,
    thundering along the platform to intercept her.  Engelman
    straight-arms his pistol.

                             ENGELMAN
              FREEZE!

    Iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut.  Her
    momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams
    into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling.  She
    gasps for breath and looks up to see...

    ... Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she
    just came through as the train starts to move.  He tries
    to force the doors apart... can't.  He aims his gun
    through the window.

    Thinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and
    presses herself up against the solid wall next to the
    door, where he can't see her.

    OUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train.
    He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt.

    Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to
    her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is
    still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag
    her right out through the window.

    She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets
    go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her
    long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the
    window, screaming.

    Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head.

    Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a
    red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol
    and fires at Iris.

    She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor.
    A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has
    short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many
    pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for
    air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over.

    SPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train
    disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig in
    his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at the
    cap.

    CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate
    network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of
    the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern
    like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal
    box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET.

    Iris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes
    going crazy wide.

                             ENGELMAN
              Oh shit.

    IT'S 4 AM.  Lenny trudges through a heavy security gate
    into the center court of his ratty building.  The pool
    furniture is in the pool.  Gang graffiti marks the walls.
    Bars on all the windows.  One of the doors looks like
    somebody opened it with an ax.  The pool lights give the
    place an eerie, dead glow.  Can out slick Lenny really
    live in this dump?

    Through a barred window we see Lenny approaching as we
    hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE on his answering machine in the
    F.G.

    BEEP.  And...

                             IRIS (V.O.)

    Iris continues to grip the phone even after she has hung

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    LENNY doesn't stop to play back Iris' message, or any of
    the twenty others on his machine.  He just deadbolts the
    door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then
    carries his Haliburton...

    ... toward the bedroom.  And we see the truth of his
    reality.  Lenny's crib is a shit-box.  It is a small one-
    bedroom, barely furnished.  A couple of chairs.  Swap-meet
    couch.  Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the
    corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a
    table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this
    stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the
    windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes
    everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech
    low-life.

    He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same
    infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated
    by racks of tapes... Squid tapes.

    Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes
    off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on
    the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed.
    This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing
    to look forward to but another day of the hustle.

    He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head,
    fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes,
    squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say
    "FAITH." Only the dates are different.

    He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some
    minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes
    his eyes.  And hits PLAY.

    PLAY BACK SEQUENCE/ POV:

    We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a
    YOUNG WOMAN on Rollerblades.  By our motion, it is obvious
    that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well.
    The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking
    up at our discomfort.
    We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we
    realize the POV is his.  The girl takes our hands, skating
    backward, towing us along the boardwalk.  It is a sunny
    afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all
    around us.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN, a singer.  Lenny is desperately
    in love with her.  It's not hard to see why.  She is
    beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way.  Her hair is a wild
    dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense.  She
    moves with a lithe, sinuous grace.  We are staring at her
    eyes instead of concentrating on skating.

    Whammo!  The POV spins and we are sitting, looking up at
    Faith as she circles, laughing.  She skates over to help
    us up.

    CUT TO LENNY, on his bed, smiling.  He punches Fast
    Forward.

    BACK TO POV.  A kinetic blur of digital hash, then...

    We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the
    steps to a beach apartment.  Inside it is funky and
    comfortable.

    Music from a disk player she left on.  Bob Marley singing
    "Three Little Birds".  Faith, covered with a sheen of
    sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We
    follow her.

    She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts
    to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up
    Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her
    and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing
    behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser.

    He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the
    music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her
    sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off her
    shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A
    voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he
    can replay and relive the moment.

    Their eyes meet in the mirror.

    They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her
    halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly,
    responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directly
    to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP.
    The intimacy is power.

                             FAITH
                      (laughs)
              Hey, you going to watch or you going
              to do?

                             LENNY
              Watch and see.

    We lean toward her, until her eyes fill frame as they
    close in a kiss.  We (Lenny) keeps ours open.  Our hands
    pull her halter over her head.  Then she pulls up on
    Lenny's T-shirt, laughing.  We see it go over our eyes,
    blocking the view for a moment.

    Then Faith kisses Lenny's bare chest.  We are looking down
    at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as
    Faith kisses lower, kneeling in front of us, unbuckling
    our belt and we--

    CUT TO LENNY in the here and now.  Lost in playback memory
    bliss.  He inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically
    recorded pleasure.

    BACK TO POV.  Lenny pulls Faith up to his face, kissing
    her, then pushing her gently to the bed, where we lie down
    together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled
    sheets.  She looks up, right at us...

                             FAITH
              I love your eyes, Lenny.
                      (she touches our
                       eyelids)
              I love the way they see.

    CUT TO LENNY, lost in the swirl of sensation.  He touches
    his tongue to his fingertip.

    IN POV we look down at Faith as we enter her.  She gasps
    and closes her eyes, grabbing the headboard with both
    hands.  There is only the sound of gasping breaths, the
    creaking bed frame.  She rocks with the rhythm of our
    thrusts, borne away by the intensity until she cries out.

    CUT TO LENNY, reliving the past, under the electrodes.  He
    reacts to the past orgasm.  The tape ends, Lenny slowly
    takes off the trodes.  There is a tiny tear at the corner
    of his eye.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT/SERIES OF SHOTS

    2:14 PM, DECEMBER 30

    Lenny cracks an eye as the Sony 35" blinks on in alarm
    mode: news flashes of the day before New Year's Eve...
    police preparations for the epic Millennium L.A. shebang
    downtown, the National Guard doing riot prep, etc.

    Sunlight comes like lasers through holes in the aluminum
    foil over the windows.  Lenny goes to the kitchen in his
    underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is
    empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle.
    Good morning.

    The TV screen shows a murder scene with cops milling
    around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the
    ground.  It cuts to a file photo of a severe-featured
    black man.

                             ANCHORWOMAN
              ... bodies of two men found early
              this morning under the Hollywood
              freeway have been identified as rap
              star Jeriko One and bandmember James
              Polton, known to fans as "Replay".
              A third body, that of a woman, has
              not yet been identified.  With his
              band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko
              One's outspoken political stance
              and violent lyrics have stirred
              nationwide controversy...

    CUT TO: A little later.  Lenny sucks on the popsicle while
    he puts the night's wardrobe together.  This is a ceremony
    he observes carefully.  Suit laid out on the bed, shirt
    beneath the jacket.  Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble
    -- well, maybe -- tries another -- that's the one.

                                                CUT TO:

    Lenny, behind the wheel of the BMW.  He is revved up, his
    look dialed-in.  He's on the move.  Seizing the day.

                             LENNY
                      (on cellular)
              You know I can get you anything you
              want, anytime you want it, just not
              right now.  We'll hook up at the
              club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah.

    Lenny wheels into a parking lot, finds a space, grabs his
    Haliburton and steps out, heading for the front door of
    the Coral Lounge.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    The decor is sort of Polynesian.  Goofy tropical motif
    murals on the walls.  The place has a mixed bag of
    customers, including upwardly mobile low-lifes who have
    graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office.
    It is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior
    entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure
    cooker.

    Lenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a
    number of the early regulars.  We get the impression he
    knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes.  He
    leans on the bar.

                             BARTENDER
              Hey, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Anything without an umbrella.

    He gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket:
    Fabrizio.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny my man, I think you want to
              meet a friend of mine.

    Lenny follows Fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed LA power-
    casual, sitting at a booth across the room.

                             LENNY
              Looks like money to me.

    Lenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows Fabrizio
    across the room.

                             FABRIZIO
              Don't forget your friends.

                             LENNY
              10 percent, Fabri, like always.

    They slide into the booth with KEITH.

                             FABRI
              Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was
              telling you about.  He can get you
              anything you--

                             LENNY
                      (cutting him off)
              Just a second.  Not to be rude,
              Keith, but I got to ask, are you a
              cop?

                             KEITH
              I understand.  No, I'm not.

                             LENNY
              You understand?  Attorney!  Right?
              Am I right?

                             KEITH
              That's right.

    Lenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the
    table.

                             LENNY
              Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law,
              would be my guess.
                      (off the guy's scowl)
              Relax.  I just like to guess, is
              all.  It's my job to know people and
              what they want... what's behind
              their eyes.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny gives people their heart's
              desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny?

                             LENNY
              That's right.  My second question I
              gotta ask, so we get our bearings
              here... have you ever jacket in?
              Have you ever wiretripped?

                             KEITH
              No.

                             LENNY
                      (a winning grin)
              A virgin brain!  Well we're going to
              start you off right.  So what do you
              know about this?  Save us some
              time...

                             KEITH
                      (shrugs)
              Just what I've read.  That the
              technology was developed for the
              Feds, to replace the body wire.  And
              now it's gone black market.  So, uh,
              do I get the deck from you?

                             LENNY
              I'll set you up, get you a deck at
              my cost... since my thing is the
              software.

                             KEITH
              Clips.

                             LENNY
              That's right.  Clips.
                      (Lenny leans in,
                       working the guy)
              Look, I want you to know what we're
              talking about here.  This isn't like
              TV only better.  This is life.  It's
              a piece of somebody's life.  Pure
              and uncut, straight from the
              cerebral cortex.  You're there.
              You're doing it, seeing it, hearing
              it... feeling it.

                             KEITH
              What kind of things exactly?

                             LENNY
              Exactly anything.  Whatever you
              want.  Whoever you want to be.
                      (handing Fabrizio a
                       twenty)
              Fabri, get us another round, would
              you.

    Fabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar.

                             LENNY
              You want to go skiing without
              leaving your den, you can.  But I'm
              assuming a guy like you, you wanna
              go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's
              not what you're interested in here.
              It's about the stuff you can't
              have... right?  The forbidden
              fruit.

    Keith nods, mesmerized by Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Like running into a liquor store
              with a .357 magnum in your hand,
              feeling the adrenalin pumping
              through your veins.  Or...
                      (pointing discreetly)
              ... see that guy, with the drop-dead
              Philipino girl friend?
                      (Keith looks)
              Wouldn't you like to be that guy for
              twenty minutes?  The right twenty
              minutes.  I can make it happen.  And
              you won't even tarnish your wedding
              ring.

    Keith touches his ring self-consciously, then grins.

                             KEITH
                      (hooked like a carp)
              Sounds good.

                             LENNY
              I can get you what you want.  You
              just have to talk to me.  I'm your
              priest, your shrink, your main
              connection to the switchboard of
              souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa
              Claus of the Subconscious.  You say
              it, you even think it, you can have
              it.  You want a girl, you want two
              girls?  I don't know what your thing
              is or what you're curious about...
              you want a guy?  You want to be a
              girl... see what that feels like?
              You want a nun to tie you up?  It's
              all doable.

                             KEITH
                      (flushed, sweating,
                       ready)
              Talk to me about costs, here.

                             LENNY
              Listen, before we get into numbers,
              I want you to try a taste.  I got a
              deck with me.

                             KEITH
              What?  Right Here?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              Step into my office.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE/MEN'S ROOM

    Close on Keith's face, as he sits on the sink counter
    reacting to a Squid tape.  He jerks... his mouth drops
    open... he gasps.  His hands start to move over his body,
    feeling it wonderingly.  He gasps again, tilts his head
    down, moans... and Lenny hits Pause on the Playback.
    Keith opens his eyes to a grinning Lenny.

                             LENNY
              You were just an eighteen year old
              girl taking a shower.  Are you
              beginning to see the possibilities
              here?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/CORAL LOUNGE

    A figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached
    Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and
    a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit.
    She tries the door of the car: locked.  She looks toward
    the Coral Lounge, debates whether to go look for Lenny.
    Better not.

    She takes a Squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a
    note on the label: "HELP ME.  IRIS." She drops the tape
    through a 2-inch gap in Lenny's sun roof... and it bounces
    off the seat, onto the floor.

    She looks through the windshield, totally distraught,
    trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the
    reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street.
    She crouches next to the BMW, trying to blot herself out.
    And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground,
    crying, afraid to move.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    A man in his late 30s: longish hair, no shave since the
    weekend, army jacket bulking over a massive frame.  A
    daunting figure as he approaches the bartender.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Where is he?

    Bobby, the bartender, cocks his eye toward the restrooms.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR/CORAL LOUNGE

    Lenny unlocks the men's room door and walks down the dingy
    corridor with her new customer, Keith.

                             KEITH
              Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get
              someplace a little less public?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops
              have more to worry about in this
              city than the squid-trade, believe
              me--

    Behind them, the door of the women's bathroom whips open
    and the guy in the army jacket grabs Lenny from behind and
    SLAMS him face-first into the wall, jamming a .45 against
    his skull.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Don't move!  That's it, assume the
              position you miserable techno-perv
              puke.

    Cop style, the man in the army jacket kicks Lenny's feet
    apart.  Starts to cuff him.

                             MAN
                      (to Keith)
              Beat it fuckwad.

    Ash-white, Keith lays a smoke trail down the hall.  On the
    main floor of the club, Fabrizio sees him splitting and
    hurries after him.

    Back in the corridor, Lenny spins around and shoves his
    attacker against the opposite wall.  The guy offers no
    resistance.  In fact, he's too weak from laughing.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Gotcha.

                             LENNY
              Damnit, Max, I was with a client!
              You think that's funny?  To mess
              with a man's livelihood?  It's not
              funny!

                             MAX
              You see the look on that preppy
              puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his
              Topsiders.

                             LENNY
                      (laughing a little)
              Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me
              money.

                             MAX
              Come on, amigo, the world's full of
              marks.  And nobody knows how to work
              'em like you do, pal.  You could
              sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a
              wedding ring!  Let me buy you a
              drink.

                             LENNY
              Least you can do.

    Max Peltier, which he mispronounces "Pelcher", slings his
    arm fraternally over Lenny's shoulder.  They cross to the
    bar.  Max roars greetings to several regulars, pushing
    between strangers like an out of control tractor.

                             REGULAR
              Yo, Pelcher!  Mad Max!

                             MAX
              Fuckin' A right I'm mad!  I might
              kill every man in here.  But first
              I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink.
                      (seeing another
                       regular)
              Hey O'Neal!  You were right, your
              wife does give good head.

    Max lurches onto a barstool and hunches there like a
    misanthropic bear, pounding the bartop.

                             MAX
              Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor!
              Double shots.  Make it Tres
              Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the
              best for my good friend Lenny, the
              finest cop that ever got thrown off
              the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.

                             MAX
              D'you always have to dress like a
              fuckin' pimp?

                             LENNY
              This tie cost more than your entire
              wardrobe.

                             MAX
              That's not sayin' much.

                             LENNY
              It's the one thing that stands
              between me and the jungle.

    Max raises his double shooter.

                             MAX
              To the jungle!  Where outa the blue
              some shitbird can cap you in the
              back of the head and ruin your whole
              day.

    He downs it in two fierce gulps.

                             LENNY
              You were lucky, Max.

                             MAX
              Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with
              a .22-short floating in my brainpan,
              and a cop pension I can't live off
              of.  Good thing I wasn't any
              luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter
              right here!

    Bobby pours for Max.

                             MAX
              You seen Faith lately?

    Lenny reacts visibly to the name, his whole demeanor
    sagging.

                             LENNY
              Naw.  She won't call me.

                             MAX
              Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get
              past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by
              far the most outstanding woman a guy
              like you could ever hope to get, I
              mean it's completely and deeply
              humiliating that she's gone, but
              it's over, campadre.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your
              concern.

    CUT TO: Iris, working her way from the front door, staying
    on the fringe of the crowd, wary, moving toward Max and
    Lenny at the bar.

                             MAX
              I just hate to see you pining away.
              It makes me want to vomit, frankly.
                      (philosophically)
              Broken hearts are for assholes.

                             LENNY
                      (seeing Iris)
              Hey, Iris, you okay?

                             IRIS
              Lenny, I got to talk to you, it's
              serious...

                             MAX
                      (looking at her face)
              What happened, honey, some john get
              rough on you?

                             IRIS
                      (to Lenny)
              I mean talk private.  Please, I'm in
              trouble, and so is Faith.

                             MAX
                      (as Lenny reacts to
                       the name)
              There it is, the magic fuckin' word.

    Lenny takes Iris by the arm and pulls her away from the
    bar.

                             IRIS
              Can we go to your car?  There's
              something you have to see right
              away.

    He nods and steers her toward the front door of the Coral
    Lounge.

                             LENNY
              What's going on?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CORAL LOUNGE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT

    Lenny and Iris come out the front door.

                             IRIS
              It's a bad situation... if they get
              me I know they're going to -- OH
              SHIT!

    She bridles like a startled horse.  Lenny looks at what
    she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot.  Must be
    the cops.  He turns back...

    She's gone.  What the hell?

    He looks back at the red light... and edges around the
    corner to see what the cops are up to...

    It's not a cop car.  It's a tow-truck, with Lenny's BMW on
    the hook.  Lenny runs to the TOW DRIVER, who looks like a
    biker only meaner.

                             LENNY
              Hang on, that's my car--

                             TOW DRIVER
              Not anymore.  Belongs to the bank.

                             LENNY
              Hey wait a second...

    Ignoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift,
    and Lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm.
    The guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a .38 in
    Lenny's face.

                             LENNY
              Oh, yeah, that's the answer!  Two
              million years of human evolution and
              that's the best idea you can come up
              with?
                      (driver continues
                       with the hoist)
              Okay.  Look, whattya get to repo a
              car?  Two hundred?  Two fifty?  I'll
              pay you three fifty, right now.  All
              you gotta do is drop it off the hook
              and say you came by, your mark
              wasn't here.  Simple.  Make a few
              bucks.  Do a good deed.  Huh?

                             DRIVER
              You got the cash on you?

                             LENNY
              I was going to write you a check, if
              that's--

    The guy is getting into his truck.

                             LENNY
              Okay, okay, I totally respect that
              call.  I would want cash.  They'll
              take my check inside... I can see
              you're pressed for time, just give
              me two minutes... here keep my watch
              for collateral.

    He hands the guy his watch.

                             LENNY
              It's a Rolex.  Be right back.  Two
              minutes.

    Lenny gets to the front door of the Coral Lounge, turns
    just in time to see the tow-truck pulling out.  Lenny runs
    after his car, yelling, watching it recede.

                             LENNY
              Son of a bitch!

    Lenny walks back to the bar.  He sets his Haliburton up on
    the truck of a car and pops it open.  He takes out a tiny
    digital cellular phone and dials a number.  While it's
    ringing he takes another, identical Rolex knock-off out of
    the briefcase and slips it on.

                                                CUT TO:

    Follow the hand and phone to the face of a black woman.
    LORNETTE "MACE" MASON.  Late twenties.  Striking features.
    Hair pulled back tight to her skull.  She is driving, but
    we don't see the car, or anything but her face.

                             MACE
              Hello?  Hey Lenny, whatup?
                      (listens a beat;
                       then)
              Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Sure.  So what
              happened to your car this time?

    EXT.  CORAL LOUNGE - NIGHT

    A black limo pulls into the lot.  It is a Continental
    armored stretch, downsized from today's standards.  The
    door opens and Mace gets out.  She is compactly built,
    dressed in black slacks, a conservative black jacket,
    heavy rubber-soled shoes.  She glances around as she heads
    for the Coral Lounge entrance, the unconscious sweeping
    gaze of a security professional.

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    Mace scopes the room quickly, professionally, then heads
    for the bar.

    ON Max and Lenny at the bar.

                             MAX
              See, if you packed your piece you
              could've made the guy see sense.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the
              line of a fine jacket.

                             MAX
              An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's
              embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen
              with you.
                      (as she slips up
                       behind them)
              Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?

    She plants herself between Max and Lenny and takes a
    generous handful of their nachos.

                             MACE
              Greetings, gents.
                      (to Lenny)
              So let's hear this week's sad story.

                             LENNY
              They jerked my wheels, d'you believe
              it?  I mean it's outrageous, the
              computer errors the banks are making
              lately.  Have you noticed?

    Mace and Max exchange a weary look.

                             MACE
              No.  I haven't noticed because I
              make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher,
              how's the P.I. business?

                             MAX
              Sucks.
                      (attention caught by
                       TV)
              Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

    The Bartender obeys: it's more news about the Jeriko One
    killing.  There's file footage of Jeriko and his band, the
    Prophets of Rage; interview with a lot of furious fans,
    mostly black inner city kids; and a news clip of Jeriko at
    an outdoor rally, exhorting the crowd with near religious
    fervor:

                             JERIKO ONE (ON T.V.)
              The LAPD is a military force turned
              against its own people.  We live in
              a police state!  The mayor and the
              city council sit up in their offices
              with their social programs that
              don't work... they're rearranging
              deck chairs on the Titanic.  But the
              new day is coming!  Two-K is coming!
              The day of reckoning is upon us.
              History ends and begins again right
              here!  Right now!

    Max raises a glass in salute to the TV screen.

                             MAX
              To the end of all things!
                      (slugs down the shot)
              You know how I know it's the end of
              the world?  Because everything's
              been done, every kind of music's
              been tried, every government's been
              tried, every fuckin' hairstyle.
              How you gonna make it another
              thousand years, for Chrissake?

    On the TV, clip of Jeriko's speech has been replaced by an
    interview with Jeriko One's manager.  TRAN VO.  Tran is
    Vietnamese, and around Lenny's age.  He's angular, suave,
    cool as an early frost.  Dialed in.  Lenny sees his face
    on the screen like a personal nightmare.

                             MAX
              I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used
              it all up--

                             LENNY
                      (riveted to the TV)
              Shutup a second!

                             MACE
              Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?

                             MAX
              Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.
                      (to screen)
              Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden
              goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer
              guy.

                             MACE
              But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
                      (she mouths the word
                       "boyfriend")

                             MAX
              Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You
              may trigger a maudlin display which
              will force us to tranquilize him.

    ON THE SCREEN, Tran is being jostled as he walks,
    answering the reporters questions in a glare of minicam
    lights.

                             REPORTER
              The LAPD have said they believe
              this is a gang-related incident.
              Can you comment on that, Mr. Vo?

                             TRAN
              We have no facts yet.  All we know
              for sure is that we have lost a
              great artist, that a great voice for
              change is now silent...

    Lenny, scowling, pushes away from the bar.  Mace goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just
              have a few stops, mostly on the west
              side--

                             MACE
              Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd
              drop you home, but I'm not taking
              you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've
              already pulled twelve hours today.

                             LENNY
                      (upbeat again)
              Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a
              big night.  Can't you feel it?  The
              energy in the air?  There's money to
              be made, dreams to sell.

                             MACE
              Sleaze to peddle.

                             LENNY
              Just a couple of hours.  It'll be
              fun--

                             MACE
              Excuse me.  What part of NO don't
              you understand?

                             LENNY
              Mace, you're my friend.  I need you.
              Plus I'll give you 25% of what I
              make tonight.

                             MACE
              Lenny, this may be a hard concept
              for you, but friends don't have to
              pay their friends.

    Lenny starts to whine like a puppy.  Mace gives up.

                             MACE
              Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got
              a pickup at the St. James.  I'll
              take you there, you can get a cab.

                             LENNY
                      (an arm around her
                       like a buddy)

              So, what's up with you?  Another
              busy night selling porno to
              wireheads?

                             LENNY
              No, wrong... I sell experiences.
              Sex is only part of it.

                             MACE
              Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.

                             LENNY
              Way I look at it, I actually perform
              a humanitarian service.  I save
              lives.

                             MACE
              Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.

                             LENNY
              Okay, take some executive... bored
              with his life, bored with his
              wife... he picks up a hooker or some
              girl at a bar.  Then he goes around
              for months, torn up worrying that
              he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his
              wife.  And maybe he really does
              catch something--

                             MACE
              Price he pays for being a
              scumsucking pig.

                             LENNY
              Everybody needs to take a walk to
              the dark end of the street sometime,
              it's what we are.  But now the risks
              are outa line.  The streets are a
              war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So
              you slip on the trodes, you get what
              you need and it keeps you from
              jumping your tracks.

                             MACE
              Lenny, this shit's illegal.

                             LENNY
              Define illegal.

                             MACE
              Me bailing your sorry pale ass out
              of jail twice in the last six
              months.

                             LENNY
                      (kidding)
              Yeah, but that was for love.

                             MACE
              Define love.

    EXT.  ST. JAMES CLUB - NIGHT

    Mace's limo wheels up to the hotel on the strip.

    A soberly-dressed Japanese executive is waiting next to
    the doorman.

    INSIDE the car, Mace spots him and scowls.

                             MACE
              Dammit, Lenny, you made me late.

    Lenny opening the door before the car stops.

                             LENNY
              What's his name?

                             MACE
              Fumitsu.

                             LENNY
              Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir,
              Leonard Nero, Security Express.
              Lornette Mason here is just
              completing our routine driver
              evaluation.  We do it to make sure
              that out VIP clients, such as
              yourself, are always treated as
              honored guests.  I just need to ride
              up front and take some notes, if you
              don't mind.

    Fumitsu nods politely and Lenny opens the car door for
    him.  Lenny jogs around behind the car to the front
    passenger door.

                             MACE
              Um, excuse me.
                      (can't stand to say
                       it)
              Sir.  Excuse me.  Mr. Nero.

    She walks calmly to him.

                             MACE
                      (hissing through her
                       teeth)
              What the fuck are you doing?

                             LENNY
                      (winning smile,
                       innocent)
              Coming with you.

                             MACE
              You will not live to see the
              morning.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    As the limo stops at an elegant home in this top-bucks,
    old-line residential area.  There is a loud party in
    progress, with a couple of hundred guests spread through
    the house and backyard.  Mace scowls deeply as Lenny gets
    out of the car and starts into the party with Mr. Fumitsu.
    They are laughing uproariously and getting along like old
    friends.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    Mace, having a cigarette with other security drivers,
    watches Lenny through the tall windows of the old Spanish
    house.  She sees him working the room, rubbing up against
    the money, networking.  No dialogue.  A pantomime of Lenny
    working his prime turf.  She stares at him for a while,
    then looks at her watch.  Sighs.

    EXT./ INT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE/GARDEN - NIGHT

    ... as a tall, stern figure suddenly slides into Lenny's
    path, a top cop named PALMER STRICKLAND.

                             STRICKLAND
              Nero.

                             LENNY
                      (uh-oh)
              Strickland.

                             STRICKLAND
              Commissioner Strickland.

                             LENNY
              Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you
              shitcanned my career, I don't even
              have to call you sir.  One of life's
              small pleasures.

                             STRICKLAND
              Aren't you peddling your wares a
              little far from your usual gutter?

                             LENNY
              I was invited here by a close
              friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right
              over there.

    Lenny waves.  Fumitsu waves back from across the room.

                             STRICKLAND
              I don't like disappointments, Nero.
              And do you know what disappoints me
              very much?

                             LENNY
              Your sex life?

                             STRICKLAND
              Your existence.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    Mace sits in her limo, talking on the cellular.

                             MACE
              Now listen to me... you have to get
              to bed young man.  I mean it.  No
              watching "Tales from the Crypt".  I
              don't care what Cecile says.  I'll
              see you in the morning, baby.
              Night, night.

    As she hangs up, she glances out the window in time to
    see...

    Lenny flying over a hedge.  He lands on the sidewalk, then
    scrambles up and brushes himself off as TWO SECURITY TYPES
    loom toward him.  He adjusts his wardrobe and walks with
    dignity (but quickly) toward the car.

                             MACE
              Are we having a bad night?

                             LENNY
                      (glancing back)
              Let's talk in the car.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls out, Lenny starts fitting a pair of playback
    trodes to his head.  Mace glances at him in disgust.  He
    hits his playback button.

    Lenny's POV as he talks to Faith.  Back when things were
    good.  He's wiring her.  They are playful, like a couple
    of kids.

                             FAITH
              I feel like you're turning me into a
              VCR.

                             LENNY
              I just want to see what we're like
              together through your eyes.

    He turns OFF the record button.  STATIC.  Then TAPE
    RESTARTS.  We see the two of them standing together,
    reflected in a mirror.

    We are Faith now.

                             FAITH
              I don't feel anything.  Is it on?

                             LENNY
              Forget it's there.

                             FAITH
              Make me forget it, baby.

    He turns her to him.  They begin to make love.  Faith's
    face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy
    passion.

    A sudden FLASH OF LIGHT.  Lenny opens his eyes to see...
    Mace's glowing countenance.

    She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head
    and tossed them out the window.  Now she's yanking him out
    of the car by his lapels.

                             LENNY
              Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is
              Armani.
                      (he looks at her)
              You angry?

                             MACE
              I've had enough of this shit.
                      (getting back into
                       the car)
              You're on foot, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              In LA?  Are you crazy?

    Mace starts to peel out, but Lenny leaps and plasters
    himself on the hood.  Mace pretends she doesn't see him.

                             LENNY
                      (as they drive along)
              Can I come in please?  I'm having a
              hard time hearing the stereo.

    Mace jams on the brakes and Lenny slides off in front of
    the car.  Now she starts to move forward...

                             LENNY
              I need my case.  It's still in the
              back.

                             MACE
              Get it.

    He quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back
    door.  Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting
    out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace.

                             LENNY
              Listen, can we talk a little bit
              here, like two rational adults?

    Mace hits a button on the dash.  The privacy divider rises
    suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling.

                             LENNY
              That would be no.

                             MACE
              I've had it.  No more wirehead shit
              in my car.  You understand?  You
              want to poach your lobes, do it
              somewhere else.

                             LENNY
              Okay, you got my attention, but this
              is cutting off the circulation to my
              head, here.  D'you mind?

    She lowers the divider, releasing him.  Lenny straightens
    his jacket and tie.  Runs a hand through his greasy hair.

                             LENNY
              I thought we were friends.

                             MACE
              No, see a friend is more than one
              person constantly doing favors for
              another.  You just suck people along
              with your schemes and your scams and
              your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I
              got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex-
              husband someplace who doesn't send
              me a dime of support... I'm just
              trying to hold on here.

                             LENNY
              So am I.  Just trying to get by.

                             MACE
              No, you're just trying to get off.

                             LENNY
              Macey... I've never seen you like
              this.

                             MACE
              Lenny, you're turning into some
              kinda squid-head low-life.  You're
              always broke, you just go from one
              score to the next.  And you're
              getting strung out... you don't even
              see it.  Getting high on your own
              supply like some crack dealer.

                             LENNY
              I know you wouldn't be saying all
              this if you didn't care about me.
              Thanks, Mace.  Really.

                             MACE
              Look, I gotta get some sleep.

                             LENNY
              You still like me, don't you?  We're
              still buddies?

    She hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm.

                             MACE
                      (a tiny smile)
              Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.

                             LENNY
              Macey, I know you're tired, but can
              you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?
              It's on your way.

                             MACE
              Jesus, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic
              behavior at all?  Will that help?
              Faith's there tonight, and I've got
              to talk to her.

                             MACE
              Sure, Lenny.
                      (she puts the car in
                       gear)
              The only thing worse than a junkie
              is someone in love.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens
    the door.

                             LENNY
              Come on, let me buy you a drink.
              Let's drink and make up.
                      (Mace shakes her
                       head)
              Alright, I'm going to see Faith.
              That means you can watch me suffer.
              I'll be in agony, you'll feel so
              much better.  Total and thorough
              payback, whatdya say?

    Mace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the
    Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a
    converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of
    dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A
    thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of
    chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp
    atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the
    clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge.

    There are many large video screens running a continuous
    montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of
    disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs.

    The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a
    lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You
    can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and
    software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain).

    Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with
    metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned:
    it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur
    9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check
    her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check.

    Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go
    immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of
    light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind.
    SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding
    court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him.

    It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record
    business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep
    everyone in his orbit.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback
    as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed
    jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is
    wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer
    silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her
    features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she
    is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot.

    Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And
    show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable
    -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His
    fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure
    behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a
    moment of suspended time.

    ... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second.

    Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage
    consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's
    personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet-
    thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the
    classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE
    BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY
    MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four.

                             LENNY
              Who's the new side of beef in Tran's
              posse?

                             MACE
              Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a
              running back for the Rams in '96 and
              '97.

                             LENNY
              Rams... that's football, right?

    He can't take his eyes off Faith.  Mace scowls at the
    tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar.

                             MACE
              Forget her.

                             LENNY
              She still loves me.

                             MACE
              She thinks you're a bucket of dog
              vomit.  Trust me on this.

                             LENNY
              She's my destiny.

                             MACE
              Destiny?  You living in a perfume
              commercial?  She's a hard-climber
              that dropped you like a used tampon
              when she got a better ride.

                             LENNY
              You'll see.

    Mace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the
    crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as
    in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny
    virtually ignores them.

    Approaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him;
    no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little
    tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense.

    Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they
    stay casual.

    Lenny doesn't break stride.  It's like a game of chicken
    without cars.  Beemer stands, covering Lenny with his
    shadow.  Vita looks up at Lenny with cobra eyes.  Tran
    gives him a glance; royalty amused by Lenny's presumption.

                             TRAN
              You come to peddle me some tapes,
              Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a
              couple bucks for the holidays?

                             LENNY
              You're not a client anymore, Tran.
              I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a
              dead dog's balls.

                             TRAN
                      (glancing at Faith,
                       back at Lenny)
              I already got everything I need from
              you.

                             FAITH
              Cut it out, Tran.

                             LENNY
              Too bad about your guy Jeriko.
              Tough break.

                             TRAN
              Show a little respect, Nero.  The
              man was an important artist.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, important for your label.
              Which no doubt is why you're in
              mourning.  Don't worry, his
              records'll sell out now he's dead.
              You'll make out.

                             TRAN
              I always do.

                             LENNY
              Faith, can I talk to you a second?

                             FAITH
              I don't think that's a good idea,
              Lenny.

                             LENNY
              I just got to talk to you for one
              second.

                             TRAN
              About what?

                             LENNY
              That would be between me and Faith,
              wouldn't it?

    Tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly
    in the general area between his table and Lenny.

                             TRAN
              I don't feel anything between you.
              See, your trouble is you assume too
              much, Lenny.  You assume there's
              something where there's nothing.
              You assume you have a life.  But
              you're only hustling pieces of other
              lives on tape, and broken parts of
              your own.

    Faith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny.

                             FAITH
                      (icy)
              We have nothing to talk about,
              Lenny.

                             TRAN
              Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely
              to his car.

    Joey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall.

                             LENNY
              Faith, call me, okay?

                             FAITH
              No, Lenny.

    Wade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts
    him moving.  She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering.
    As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him
    coming the other way.

                             LENNY
              Tick, listen, I can't stop right
              now.  but I'll call you tomorrow
              about that thing we were talking
              about.

    He's working the room even as he's getting dragged
    outside.

                             TRAN
              Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of
              stolen dreams.

                             FAITH
              Leave him alone, Tran.

                             TRAN
              He's no concern of mine, as long as
              you don't talk to him.  Don't talk
              to anybody.  You understand?  Not
              with everything that's going on
              right now.

                             FAITH
              You're too goddamned paranoid.

                             TRAN
              Paranoia's only reality on a finer
              scale.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Beemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside.

    A SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.  Lenny brushes
    off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the
    entering crowd.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Lenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor.
    Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below.  And
    one face, looking up at him.  Kind of casual.  Lenny
    clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out.  Decides he
    doesn't know him.  But we do.  It's Spreg.  Lenny walks
    on, crosses to a door, and enters...

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  VJ BOOTH/RETINAL FETISH

    A tiny room overlooking the dance floor.  Crammed with
    electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana,
    whipping from one deck to another, hands flying.  He's in
    a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five
    Lenny as he walks in.

                             LENNY
              So, those rascals still haven't
              grown back yet, huh?

                             TEX
                      (peering under the
                       blanket on his lap)
              Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now,
              though.

                             LENNY
                      (handing Tex a Squid)
              Present.  Something I had made.  Let
              me know what you think.

                             TEX
              Hey, alright.  Got something here
              for you, too.
                      (passes him an
                       envelope)
              It just showed up tonight, don't
              know who left it.

                             LENNY
              Fan mail from some flounder?

    Lenny looks at the envelope, which has "Nero" hand-printed
    in block letters.  Tex takes a pull from a flask as he
    takes a squid-deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in.
    He puts on the headset and pushes PLAY.

    IN POV we are on a beach.  Early morning.  We are running
    flat out, with the wind.  Looking down... we are barefoot
    on the wet sand.  Foaming water races up the sand and
    breaks around our strong male legs.  Looking up again, to
    see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in
    shorts and T-shirt.  She laughs and we speed up.  An
    exquisite moment of pure life force.

    TIGHT ON TEX'S FACE... as a tear leaks from the corner of
    his eye.  He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful
    music.  We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift.

    Tex opens his eyes.  Looks for Lenny to say thanks: but
    Lenny's gone.  Not a guy to hang around for thanks-yous.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    As Lenny comes down the stairs from the VJ booth, tearing
    open the envelope.  An unmarked Squid tape falls into his
    hand.

    The HOUSE LIGHTS dim and the STAGE LIGHTS come up.  And
    Faith is standing there.  Like she beamed in.  She is
    wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her
    milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving
    her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing.
    Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes.

    SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering
    sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses
    like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice
    becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The
    pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on
    its eve of judgment.

    Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels
    across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that
    her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak.

    A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature.

    Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times.
    But it always has the same effect on him.  He is
    transported into another world by her, a world in which
    there is only the two of them.

    TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the
    puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform
    before.  Holy shit.

    Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any
    way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting
    it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now
    shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and
    holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she
    possibly could.  Then nothing.

    When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk
    away.  Fuck you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/BACKSTAGE & DRESSING ROOM

    At BACKSTAGE, Lenny wends his way through the warren of
    corridors... past dim rooms full of wire junkies and
    playback freaks, all trapped into Squid nirvana: post-
    modern opium dens.  Sinister and scary.  He glimpses
    Faith, going into her dressing room.  He hurries...

    ... but she doesn't even look around when his reflection
    appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity
    table.  She is drenched with sweat.  Spent.  Chugging a
    beer.  This is the first time they have been alone
    together in real-time for months.  Pain and the memory of
    joy.

                             LENNY
              Hi, baby.  I've missed you.

                             FAITH
              I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you
              talking to me he'll hurt you.

                             LENNY
              I'm already hurting.

    She doesn't turn.  Just watches him in the mirror.  Most
    of the scene plays this way.  It is a cold parody of their
    love-making playbacks.

                             FAITH
              You have to go.  I mean it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just
              answer one question.  Is anything
              wrong?  Iris said you might be in
              trouble.

                             FAITH
                      (startled, turning
                       to him)
              You talked to Iris?  When?

                             LENNY
              Tonight.

                             FAITH
              Well I haven't seen her in months.
              Who knows what's going on in her
              head.  You're really running out of
              excuses to come around, aren't you?

                             LENNY
              I know you Faith.  You're afraid of
              something.  What's going on?

                             FAITH
              Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take
              care of itself.

                             LENNY
              It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is
              poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's
              got you walled in on all sides.  And
              he uses the wire too much, he gets
              off on tape, not on you.

                             FAITH
              That's a good one, coming from you.

                             LENNY
              Why don't you just split?  You don't
              love him, anybody can see that.  And
              to him you're just some kinda
              possession, like a Ferrari,
              something to show the other guys.

                             FAITH
              He has his uses too.

                             LENNY
              What?  He gonna record you on his
              label?

                             FAITH
              Maybe.

                             LENNY
              Come on, Faith!  He's just toying
              with you.  And when he gets bored,
              you'll be yesterday's papers.

    Lenny is right behind her now.  He puts his hands on her
    shoulders, tenderly.

                             LENNY
              Look, baby, I've watched you create
              yourself out of nothing.  You're
              like a goddamn cruise missile,
              targeted on making it.  And you
              will.

                             FAITH
              Damn right.

                             LENNY
              It's you up on that stage, not him.
              You don't need him.

    She shrugs away from his touch.  Cold again.

                             FAITH
              You have to get out of here.  If
              Tran catches you he'll... he's
              acting crazy.  He's doing way too
              much playback and he's getting
              completely paranoid.  He's such a
              control freak, he's even paying Max
              to follow me around.

                             LENNY
              Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?

                             FAITH
              Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny,
              just stay away from Tran, okay?  And
              stay away from me.  Stop trying to
              rescue me.  Those days are over.
              I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to
              save me, okay, because I don't need
              saving... Just... give up on me.

                             LENNY
              Can't do it.

                             FAITH
              You know one of the ways movies
              still have Squid beat?  Because they
              always say "The End." You always
              know when it's over.  It's over!
              Now please leave.  I have to go on
              again in a couple of minutes.

    She looks at him and, after a moment, he nods and leaves.
    As the door closes behind him, Faith tosses her towel on
    the table.  She looks frightened and alone.

                             FAITH
              Hell.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/CORRIDOR AND MAIN FLOOR

    Turning a corner from the dressing room into the CORRIDOR,
    Lenny runs into Max.

                             LENNY
              Shoulda told me about your new gig,
              buddy.

                             MAX
              I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just
              a job.  I feel like shit about it.

                             LENNY
              You should feel like shit.

                             MAX
              I figured, what the hell, I could
              take the prick's money and make sure
              Faith was OK at the same time.  Do
              us both good.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for
              you.
                      (already over it)
              Hey, at least you got a job!
                      (slaps him on the
                       back)
              Watch her for me.  Stay on her.

                             MAX
              I'm on her.

    Lenny climbs the stairs to the MAIN FLOOR, pushing his way
    through the crowd.

    Vita, watching the backstage area leans over to Tran,
    whispers in his ear.  Tran makes a sign to Beemer, and he
    stands to go after Lenny.

    Mace, at the bar, sees the Tran-Vita-Beemer action, looks
    around for Lenny.  Can't find him.  But figures there's
    got to be only one reason Beemer's on the prowl: he's
    looking for Lenny.  She whips out her cellular.

    CUT TO: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful come-along
    hold and hustling him toward the back of the club.

    Lenny's cellular rings.

                             LENNY
              Can I get that?

    He reaches for his cellular, connects with...

    MACE, over by the bar.

                             MACE
              Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I
              think Tran's got Beemer looking for
              you.

    BACK TO: Lenny, as he's hustled out the rear door.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for the tip.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALLEY/RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    Beemer shoves Lenny into the alley and shuts the door
    behind him.

                             LENNY
              I recognize you.  You're Wade
              Beemer.  Running back for the Rams,
              am I right?

    Beemer, who was about to go to work on Lenny, pauses.

                             BEEMER
              Yeah, that's right.

                             LENNY
              I saw you play, man.  You were good.
              Like a fucking freight train I
              remember saying.  So what happened,
              injuries or what?

                             BEEMER
              Bullshit politics.

                             LENNY
              It's always politics.  Like this
              thing we're in here, he's paying you
              to tune me up, right?  But I could
              pay you more not to.  See what I
              mean?  I could write you a check
              right now--

                             BEEMER
              Come on, let's go, I got to get
              back.

                             LENNY
                      (pulling money out
                       of his pocket)
              Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's
              everything I have on me, what do you
              say?  How about a Rolex?

                             BEEMER
                      (barely a glance at
                       it)
              I already got a real one.  Come on,
              it won't be too bad.  It's not
              personal.

                             LENNY
                      (taking off the
                       Armani carefully)
              Just not the eyes.

    Beemer swings.

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    As Lenny approaches the car, moving painfully, dabbing at
    a bloody nose.  Mace looks at him pityingly.

                             LENNY
              They oughta get some lights back
              there.  A person could get killed
              slipping on those stairs.  Let's go.

    CUT TO: an eerie NIGHT VISION SHOT of Mace and Lenny
    getting into the limo.  Then we see: Spreg and Engelman,
    the two street Hun cops.  Watching.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MACE'S LIMO

    Lenny slumps in the back seat.

                             MACE
              You're some piece of work, you know
              that.  Just calmly backstroking
              around in the big toilet bowl, and
              somehow you never let it touch you.
              I mean, between Vice and this so-
              called occupation you're in now, you
              must've seen it all.

                             LENNY
              I have crawled through the gutter...
              through every wrinkle in the human
              brain.

                             MACE
              What I'm saying.  But you still come
              out this goofball romantic.

                             LENNY
              It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

    Lenny finds the anonymous tape in his pocket.  He looks a
    it, puzzled.

                             MACE
              What's that?  Present from Faith?

                             LENNY
              No idea.

    He opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts
    the Squid rig on and closes his eyes.  Maybe he can forget
    about Faith a minute.  He punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: the first thing we notice is that the POV is
    distorted visually.  The colors are de-saturated.  Almost
    black and white.  Yet the detail is crisp and clear,
    almost hyper-real.

    WE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel.
    An apparently endless row of doors.  The Wearer's glance
    goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time.

    We come to a particular door.  There is a DO NOT DISTURB
    sign on the door.  The Wearer moves to the room next door.
    Looks both ways.  The corridor is empty.

                             LENNY
              It's a test pattern so far.

    "Our" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical
    gloves.  They look like male hands.  The snapping of the
    rubber is the only sound in the corridor.  The POV hunches
    down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with
    lock-picking tools.  Several seconds and the lock is very
    professionally picked.

                             LENNY
              Alright, a little B&E action.

    We enter the dark room, which is vacant.  The drapes are
    open and we see city lights.  It is night.  One gloved
    hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the
    moonlight coming in the window: the SUNSET SHERATON.

    The Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear
    holding... a black ski-mask.  He pulls it on, leaving the
    subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask.

    The Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser.  He has
    avoided his reflection up until now.  We see a man,
    dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of
    course the ski-mask.  Totally anonymous.

                             LENNY
              Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense
              build.

    The Wearer crosses to the balcony door.  Opens it quietly
    and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's
    balcony from the one next door.

    The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the
    pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the
    other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into
    the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a
    woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She
    turns...

    It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties.
    Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep.
    Pours the Scotch shakily.

    CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He
    gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread.

    IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We
    can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy
    the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and
    silently opens it, slipping inside.

    We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her
    movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around
    the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in
    the bathroom, washing her face with cold water.

    We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for
    a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She
    comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying
    her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes
    whip back.  Widening in terror.

    She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed.
    We go after her.

    Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small
    automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it
    and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the
    palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed,
    lightning-fast.

    We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the
    bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short
    hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she
    somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the
    hall.

    Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor.
    Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric
    stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the
    shoulder blades.

    She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The
    Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor...
    nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and
    drag her back into her room, locking the door.

    ON LENNY, reacting.  Going white.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT
              NOW!  Just go!  GO!

    Lenny goes back under the wire, seeing...

    WE ARE DRAGGING a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom...
    propping her up with her back against the white tile
    wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one
    to the steel towel rack above her.  She is moaning.  And
    crying.

                             IRIS
                      (voice distorted)
              I haven't seen your face... I
              haven't heard your voice... you can
              still let me go...

    ZAP!  The Wearer hits her with the stunner again.  She
    jerks and gasps for breath.  We see our latex-gloved
    finger come up in front of us and hear SSSHHH.

    Moving quickly now.  Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack.
    Pull out something... a set of playback trodes.  Our hands
    place them on her head.  She stares uncomprehending.
    What?  We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside
    the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box.

                             LENNY
              Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to
              his own output.  She's seeing what
              he's seeing.  She's seeing herself.

    Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide-
    eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And
    she can feel what he feels.

    The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls
    out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip
    it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now
    she can only see what the wearer sees.

    And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object.
    With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor
    knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by
    segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous
    clicking sound.

    We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T-
    shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look
    down and slide the knife under the side band of her
    panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her
    throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we
    draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to
    tease her with the prospect of her death.

    MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and
    pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the
    Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in
    his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is
    experiencing the stalker's exhilaration.

    IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below
    his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling
    in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her
    hips forward onto him, pushing into her.

    Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She
    feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the
    killer's exhilaration.

    ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops
    the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his
    eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may
    reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He
    pushes her hand away and punches PLAY.

    IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting
    horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly
    wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists
    one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his
    forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter.

    The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the
    T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her
    jaw.

    Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death comes
    at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her...
    blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain,
    death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same
    instant.

    ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he
    just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains
    out of his skull.

                             LENNY
                      (like a mantra)
              On my God.  Oh my God.

    BACK TO POV, a glimpse of the Wearer's hand relaxing the
    knot.  Iris' head lolls.  Her mouth is slack and open.  We
    remove her blindfold.  Her eyes are half-lidded.  Very
    dead looking.  Our fingers gently push them wide open.

    BACK TO LENNY, looking like he has been gut kicked.  He
    gasps for breath.

    TO POV, as the killer's hand calmly moves Iris' head from
    side to side... studying her dead face.  Her staring eyes.
    He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye,
    the pupil wide, seeing nothing.

    A burst of static.  End of tape.

    Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and
    practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull
    off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk
    to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He
    doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach.

    Mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to
    his knees.  She holds his shoulders while he throws up
    again.

                             MACE
              My God, Lenny.  What is it?

                             LENNY
              Black.  Jack.

                             MACE
              Blackjack?  I don't understand--

                             LENNY
              Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said
              she needed my help and I... aw
              Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Are you sure it's real?

    Lenny looks up, in the direction of the hotel.  Mace
    follows his glance.  They notice for the first time: cop
    lights; cop cars; ambulance; coroner's wagon.

    CLOSE on Iris' body, in a bag, being loaded into the
    coroner's van.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/DIM SUM JOINT/LITTLE TOKYO - NIGHT

    Neon reflections on the roof of Mace's limo as it pulls
    into the lot and slides up to Max's car.  Max is sitting
    in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings
    from a take-out carton.  He looks up as Lenny and Mace get
    out of the limo.  Sees their expressions.

                             MAX
              Ohhhh shit.

    TIME CUT: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace's Lincoln,
    has his head propped in his hands.  His eyes are
    distant... replaying.  Still shocked to his soul.  Mace
    paces nearby.

    Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes
    on, playing back the tape.  His face is transformed into
    an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock.  With
    shaky hands he stops the deck.

    Opens his eyes.  Long beat.  He glances down at the dim-
    sum carton in his hands.

                             MAX
              Well... I've lost my appetite.
                      (lofts it into a
                       nearby dumpster)
              For about a year.

    He gets to his feet, offering the deck and trodes to Mace.

                             MACE
              No way.

    Max pulls a hip-flask full of tequila from his army jacket
    and takes an eye-watering pull.  Offers it to Lenny, who
    follows suit.

                             MAX
              You alright?  Y'okay?

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  No, not really.

                             MAX
              Let's work it.

                             LENNY
              Not now... I don't want to think
              about it--

                             MAX
              Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good
              at this stuff.  Play it down.
              What's the perp doing?

                             LENNY
              He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then
              he does her...

                             MAX
              And he records it.  Thrill kill.
              Wants to see it again.  And again.

                             LENNY
              He records himself raping and
              killing her--

                             MAX
              But at the same time he's sending
              the signal to her--

                             LENNY
              So she feels... what he feels...
              while he's in her.  The thrill while
              he's killing her... is sent to her,
              heightening her fear... which in
              turn heightens the turn on for him.
                      (turns to him)
              I've seen a lot, Max.

                             MAX
              So've I.  Too much.

                             LENNY
              But this is a bad one.

                             MAX
              Top ten.

                             LENNY
              He makes her see her own death,
              feeds off the reaction... killer and
              victim merging... orgasm and agony
              merging.  And he records it all.

                             MACE
              And gives it to you.

                             LENNY
              Wants to share.

                             MAX
              That's right.  He wants to share.
              Needs an audience.  This is one sick
              puppy.

                             LENNY
              Why me?

    Mace is hugging herself.  Edgy and tense.

                             MACE
              Cause you're the man, right?  The
              Magic Man.  If it's got something to
              do with the wire, sooner or later it
              washes up on your beach.

                             LENNY
              I've never dealt in black-jacks.
              Never.  Everybody knows that.

                             MAX
              He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying
              to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing
              you to do something.

                             MACE
              Maybe he just figures Lenny will
              appreciate what he's created.  It's
              the dark end of the street, Lenny.
              How do you like it now?

                             LENNY
              Jesus, Mace.  Back off.

                             MACE
              This guy is someone you know, one of
              your squid-head contacts.

                             MAX
              Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.

                             MACE
              Take the tape to the cops.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.

                             MACE
              So some psycho wire-freak gets to
              keep running around--

                             MAX
              Naw, he's right.  They'll figure
              Lenny's the perp, or go through his
              client list, ruin his life... such
              as it is.  Look, I'll call the guys
              in Homicide... tell them she was a
              friend of mine and they'll keep me
              in the loop.  Get me the forensics
              and all that.
                      (he opens his car
                       door)
              Get some sleep.  I'll call you when
              I get something.
                      (he starts his car)
              And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I
              were you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR AND TRAN'S LOFT

    The elevator is huge -- big enough for a truck -- and
    Lenny seems small in the huge space, while shadows crawl
    across his body as the old machinery pulls him up
    toward...

    FAITH, in the loft above.  She looks into the vast
    bedroom...

    ... at Tran sitting in a chair, tranced out under playback
    trodes, his eyes closed.  She softly closes the sliding
    door and walks across the cavernous main room.  The place
    is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge
    television screens along both walls.  Otherwise there is
    little light.  The cavernous loft is sparsely but very
    expensively furnished.  Haute-tech design.  Total contrast
    to Lenny's ratty digs.

    LENNY'S POV through the cage-door of the elevator as it
    reaches the loft and Faith is revealed, waiting for him in
    the shadows.  He slides open the cage-door and she moves
    quickly to him.

                             FAITH
                      (whispering, furtive)
              You're crazier than I thought,
              Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just
              in there.

                             LENNY
              Iris is dead.  She was murdered.

    Faith stiffens.  We see the fear, now, exposed.

                             FAITH
              Who did it?

                             LENNY
              Don't know.  But this guy's real
              damaged goods.  Iris knew someone
              was after her... and she said you
              were in danger too.
                      (he grabs her
                       shoulders)
              Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever
              you're hiding, whatever's going on,
              you have to get out of here now.
              Come with me right now.  Don't even
              think about it.

                             FAITH
              Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You
              going to protect me?  Big tough guy.
              You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't
              even have a gun.

                             LENNY
                      (hurt)
              I have a gun.  It's under my bed.

                             FAITH
              You don't know what you're fucking
              with here.

                             LENNY
              Tell me.

    A VOICE from the shadows, like the whisper of a blade in
    the air.

                             TRAN
              Go ahead, Faith.  Tell him.

    Tran steps forward, totally at ease with the situation.
    Out of the shadows behind him step Joey Corto, Duncan and
    Vita Minh.

                             FAITH
              Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to
              give me some bad news.  An old
              friend of mine has been murdered.
              You remember Iris?

                             TRAN
              A tragic story, no doubt.
                      (to Lenny)
              How'd you get up here?

                             LENNY
              Charm.

                             TRAN
                      (looks at Faith)
              Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you
              an offer.
                      (he grabs Faith by
                       the arm, steps
                       closer)
              Take her.  Right now.  If she wants
              to go, if she's unhappy here, she
              can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith
              always knows what she wants.
                      (he turns her loose)
              Hands off.  See?

    Lenny glances at the open elevator right behind him.  So
    close.  She just has to take one step to him... and they
    will be out of there.  Together.

                             LENNY
              It's alright.  He means it.

                             TRAN
                      (to Faith)
              I do mean it.
                      (to Lenny)
              And I mean this... if Faith stays
              you go away and never come back.
              You scuttle back into your cockroach
              hole and never cross my vision
              again.  You understand?

    She glares at them both for a long moment.  Emotions play
    across her face, complex and unreadable.  She steps back,
    taking her place at Tran's side.

                             FAITH
              I made my choice, Lenny.

                             TRAN
                      (to Lenny, nodding
                       toward the elevator)
              You're going down.

    Joey Corto and Duncan shove Lenny roughly backward into
    the elevator.  Corto slams the gate shut and slaps a
    button to lower the lift.  The last thing Lenny sees as he
    descends is Faith's face, above him.

                             FAITH
              I don't love you, Lenny.  Give up.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BEDROOM AREA/TRAN'S LOFT

    Faith is crying as Tran comes up behind her.

                             FAITH
              You said you were going to get her
              out of this.

                             TRAN
              Maybe now you appreciate the danger
              we're in.
                      (he moves very close)
              It was touching the way you stood by
              me in there.  "Stand by your man".
              I was moved.  You were very good.  I
              don't think he even understands that
              you did it for him.

                             FAITH
              He doesn't know what's going on.
              Leave him alone.

                             TRAN
              I'd love to.  But he keeps showing
              up.  And you keep talking to him.  I
              can't have that--

    And he slaps her.  Really hard.  Decks her.  He's
    trembling with rage... and something else.  Fear.

                             TRAN
              The only time a whore should open
              her mouth is when she's giving head.

                             FAITH
              Fuck you.

                             TRAN
                      (walking away)
              Maybe later.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR/TRAN'S LOFT

    The huge elevator, with Lenny its sole occupant, descends
    through the shadows toward the first floor.  Lenny watches
    the shadow patterns on the wall through the iron grillwork
    door.  He's still thinking about Faith...

    ... even when the elevator reaches the first floor and
    Mace comes into view.  She's waiting for him.  He steps
    forward.  But he can't open the grillwork door.  And the
    elevator doesn't stop.  It keeps going down.  Lenny,
    spooked, works the door hard... as Mace disappears from
    view above him...

    ... and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement.
    With Vita and the beef squad waiting for Lenny, stoney-
    faced.  Last stop.  All out.

    Lenny tries to keep the door shut, but Duncan wrenches it
    open.  Vita grabs Lenny and twists his arm painfully
    behind him in one fluid move.  They hustle him toward a
    dank basement room near the elevator.

                             LENNY
                      (speed-rap)
              Listen, can we be smart here?  I
              could make it really worth your
              while... I could cut you a check for
              500 each... hell, make it an even
              grand... I'm not saying you don't
              land a couple shots, just go light
              is all I'm saying... here, take my
              Rolex.

                             CORTO
              Lemme see.

    A glimmer of hope in Lenny's eye as he whips it off his
    wrist.  Corto doesn't even look at it.  Gets it over his
    hand about mid-way, then -- using the watch like a pair of
    brass knuckles -- clobbers Lenny in the face.  Watch parts
    go flying as Corto steps away and Duncan slams Lenny up
    against a column.

    Vita weighs in... gut-punching Lenny savagely.  She works
    him expertly, with a series of painful jabs.

    He sags to his knees.  Not only is this painful.  It's
    goddamn humiliating.  And Duncan and Corto enjoy every
    second of it.

                             CORTO
              We tried to find a smaller girl, to
              beat the shit out of you, Lenny...
              but it was short notice.

    Vita grabs Lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one
    rock-hard arm.  She is cocking back the other arm for a
    pile-driver punch when...

    Suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her.  Mace
    drives Vita head first into the steel column.

    Duncan lunges in and grabs for Mace.  This is a mistake.
    Mace doesn't fight fancy.  And she doesn't fight fair.
    She fights to win.  And she is awesomely fast.  Her moves
    are street moves, coupled with arm-locks and come-alongs
    she has been trained to use as a security driver.

    Lenny recovers enough to size up Vita, who is still a
    little stunned.  She has blood dripping in her eyes and
    can't see too well.

    But she charges him.  And -- being the gent that he is --
    he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair.

    Mace drops Duncan about the time Vita is hitting the
    ground, leaving...

    CORTO, who fumbles out a Beretta 9mm and sticks it in
    Mace's face.  He sniggers, loving the upper hand.

                             MACE
              Safety's on.

    And like a jerk, he looks.

    She snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly
    fast, twisting the gun out of his hand.  She continues to
    twist his wrist brutally and Corto goes down to one knee,
    groaning.  She takes his Beretta and backhands the barrel
    hard across his face.  Mace releases his wrist and he
    crumples in a heap.

    She and Lenny back out the door.  Then Lenny runs back in
    and kicks Corto in the ribs.

                             MACE
              Lenny!

    Mace grabs him and pulls him out of the room, then slams
    the metal firedoor behind them, locking it with a piece of
    junk wedged behind the release bar.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace and Lenny hotfoot it toward the parked limo.  Mace is
    disassembling the Beretta without looking at it.  She
    chucks pieces over a chain-link fence as they go.  Lenny
    brushes himself off, checking his jacket for damage.  He
    is high from winning the fight.

                             LENNY
              Is this great fabric or what?

                             MACE
              You ever wonder why you get beat up
              a lot?

                             LENNY
              Never really thought about it.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    Squid POV: the killer enters the vacant hotel room,
    passing the mirror on the dresser.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Come on... look in the mirror.  You
              know it's there, you're keeping your
              eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT!
              Who are you?

    CUT TO: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace near
    him.

                             LENNY
              He knows what he's doing.  He's worn
              before... a lot.

                             MACE
              So that gives you something.

                             LENNY
              It gives me... I don't know... maybe
              two hundred people who I know wear.

    As he talks Lenny fiddles with some custom electronics
    gear.  The back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire
    connecting it to some kind of amplifier black-box which he
    is using to boost the gain.

                             MACE
              Don't crank the gain any more.
              You're gonna fry yourself.

                             LENNY
              I need to see more... get more
              detail.  Something.  I feel his
              presence, so strong...

    Mace watches, concerned, as Lenny puts the trodes back on
    and hits playback.

    Squid POVs: strobe-like images of Iris' rape and death,
    separated by burst of static...

    ... as Lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons,
    searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on
    the tape, trying to manage his revulsion...

    ... until Mace yanks the trodes off and Lenny sags back on
    the couch.  He rubs his eyes.  He is seeing ghosts,
    afterimages burned into his visual cortex.  The room is
    alive with them, shimmering.

                             MACE
              No more, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.

    Lenny see Iris' terrified face.  Literally.  It floats
    iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly.

                             LENNY
              She came to me for help.  I should
              have read it better... I just
              figured, y'know... another strung-
              out hooker having a bad night.

                             MACE
              It's not your fault.

    Lenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen.  She goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Sex killers act alone.  So there's
              no information on the street, which
              is how cases get made.  Cops know
              they'll never nail this guy the
              second they look at the scene.

    Lenny sucks down four Tylenol with a long pull from a
    bottle of vodka.

                             LENNY
              And anyway, nobody gives a shit
              about a dead hooker.  They're
              roadkill.

    Requiem for Iris.  Mace watches Lenny rubbing his eyes,
    waiting for the Tylenols to hit.

                             LENNY
              See, it's all about what they see
              walking in.  A dead hooker,
              handcuffs, penetration... they'll
              see a trick gone wrong.  Random
              kill.  The kind you never solve.

                             MACE
              But that doesn't add, does it.

                             LENNY
              No it doesn't.

                             MACE
              Because Iris knew somebody was after
              her.

    Lenny, wound up like a Swiss movement, starts pacing.

                             LENNY
              She said "If they get me".  They.
              Which means the whole sex-killer
              thing is a cover, which means
              somebody whacked her for a reason.

                             MACE
              So the guy's not a sicko.

                             LENNY
              If he could do what's on that tape,
              he's a sicko.

                             MACE
              Okay, so he's a freak who thinks
              he's sane pretending to be a freak.
              The point is, he was a hitter.
              Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But
              why not just put a little lead in
              her ear?

                             LENNY
              Because it had to look random.  Not
              connected to anything or anyone.
                      (he seems to run out
                       of energy)
              But then why give the rape to me?

                             MACE
              That's where it gets a little
              strange.

                             LENNY
              And what about the guy that was
              following me?

                             MACE
              Now you're really getting paranoid.

    Lenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples.

                             LENNY
              The question is not whether I am
              paranoid, but whether I am paranoid
              enough.  You want to rub my neck?

                             MACE
              Sure.

    Mace sits next to him and starts to work.  Strong, knowing
    fingers.  Lenny starts to relax a little.

                             LENNY
              How's Zander?

                             MACE
              OK.  He asks about you all the time.
              It's been weeks since you've seen
              him.

    Lenny sort of keels over.  His head slumps in her lap.

                             MACE
              I'm sorry about getting on your case
              earlier.  I just see you getting
              sucked in deeper and deeper, and I
              -- anyway.  I'm sorry.

                             LENNY
                      (drifting off,
                       joking)
              S'okay.  I know you still love me.

    She looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his
    sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture.  He
    is out cold.

    Mace gazes at Lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't
    seen before: unguarded.  Caring.  Loving.

    And we get it: she does love him.  It makes no sense, and
    it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her... but
    there it is.

    She shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now.
    Maybe not ever.  She leans her head back against the ratty
    top of the couch, sighs.  And keeps her hand moving
    soothingly on his head.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT./ INT.  MACE'S HOUSE/INGLEWOOD - DAY

    Mace pulls the limo into the driveway of a modest stucco
    house in Inglewood.  It's dawn.  A neighbor is walking the
    dog.  Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of
    toys left scattered in the front yard.

    Inside, ZANDER, age 6, is watching TV in his pajamas and
    eating a bowl of cereal.  Behind him, on the couch, is
    Mace's younger sister CECILE, zee'd-out.  Zander frowns at
    her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch.

                             ZANDER
              Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a
              guy?

                             MACE
              Just Lenny.

                             ZANDER
              Right.  That explains it.

                             MACE
              Are you going to make me beg?

    Zander scrambles over to his mom, throws his arms around
    her.  Big hug.

                             MACE
                      (looking at weird
                       stuff in cereal)
              What is that?

                             ZANDER
              Cheerios and wieners.  I made it
              myself.  It's good.

                             MACE
              Well give me some then... I'm
              starving.

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    2:20  P.M.  DEC 31

    Lenny wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing.  He is
    on the couch, still clothed.  He hears Max's voice on the
    answer machine and groggily grabs the receiver.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              Hey, the last day of the world and
              you spend it in bed.

                             LENNY
              W'sup, Max?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  A.M.E. CHURCH AND STREET/SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

    Max, on the cellular, across the street from a church
    where mourners stream out of a memorial for Jeriko One.
    The sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further
    off -- a cordon of very anxious-looking crowd control
    cops.

                             MAX
              Not a whole hell of a lot.  They've
              just been saying words over Jeriko.
              Tensions running pretty high down
              here.  I'm telling you.

    WHAT MAX SEES across the street... SLOWMO as Tran comes
    out of the church with Faith next to him.  Corto, Vita,
    Duncan and Beemer form a loose protective shell around
    them as the press bears down, shouting out questions.
    Tran ushers Faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after
    her.  The rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the
    car as it pulls away.

    CUT TO: Max, still on the phone to Lenny.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Faith OK?

                             MAX
              Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I
              got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris
              checked into the Sheraton last night
              under a false name.  Paid cash.

                             LENNY
              Looks like she was holding out.

                             MAX
              Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in
              on Tran last night.  Another slick
              Lenny move.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              He's in this somehow... I don't know
              how.  Just stay close to Faith.

                             MAX
              I'm on her, amigo.  No worries.
              Gotta jam.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    As Lenny is hanging up he notices something.  A MANILA
    ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his
    front window, next to the door.  "NERO" is printed on the
    envelope.

    Oh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one is
    around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars
    and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He
    stares at it with dread.

    Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  He
    picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He
    notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath and
    punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated
    signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is
    walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment
    building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken
    deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally-
    like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door...
    the back door to Lenny's apartment.

    The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the
    door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We
    are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping
    in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room.

    Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively
    looking around the door frame to the living room.  There
    is Lenny, crashed out on the couch.

    Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside
    him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep
    under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends
    the blade... click, click, click, click.

    The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward
    Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat.
    Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark.

    The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends.

    LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He
    feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel
    anything.

    Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he
    inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line
    over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his
    heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under
    control.

    Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click.

    His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently
    into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and
    pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently
    toward the kitchen.

    Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine.
    He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine
    under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly,
    wincing as he chambers a round.

    Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He
    edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes
    intact.

    Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny
    look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the
    bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed
    casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon
    jacket over a tank-top.

                             MACE
              Whatup Lenny?

                             LENNY
                      (hands shaking)
              Jesus, Mace!

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    A little later.  As Lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag:
    clothes, a playback deck, a box of .45 hollow points.  He
    grabs his grimy old Second Chance body armor from the LAPD
    and stuffs it into his Haliburton.  When Mace sees him do
    that, she knows things are freaky.

                             MACE
              Where we going?

                             LENNY
              Anywhere.
                      (finger to his lips)
              We'll talk about it in the car.

    Mace glances around... unnerved by the possibility of
    audio surveillance.

                             LENNY
              Hand me that box of tapes, will you?

    He's pointing to a shoe box full of "Faith" tapes.  Mace
    hands them over with obvious distaste.  He throws them in
    the bag, starts to zip it...

    ... then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror:
    something's the matter.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              This tie doesn't go with blue!

    He yanks off the tie and grabs another.

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY

    Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last
    day of this millennium.  There are cops in body armor and
    helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles.
    Helicopters orbit endlessly.  And a National Guard tank
    rumbles down the street.  State of siege.  The car radio
    is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending
    Millennium LA party.

                             POOR MAN
              ... the New Years Eve mega-bash of
              the century.  Ten square blocks of
              madness, with live music, fireworks
              and the actual rich and famous of LA
              hobnobbing with us peons.  Also
              yours truly the Poor Man will be
              there at the KROQ bandshell, giving
              away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K"
              T-shirts by the truckload--

    Lenny is keyed up and tense.  He keeps looking out the
    back window.

                             MACE
              Will you relax.  There's nobody back
              there.

                             LENNY
              Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my
              throat.  In my living room.
              Relaxing might be right out, okay?!

                             MACE
              You better keep a low profile for a
              while.

                             LENNY
              No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

    EXT.  BACKYARD/MACE'S HOUSE - DAY

    On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five.
    Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand
    choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander
    laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself.
    Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like
    to see more of.

    Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS,
    and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18,
    dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to "The
    Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a
    dispassion that flirts with distaste.

                             ZANDER
              What do you got?

                             LENNY

              Lenny, have you lost it completely?

              Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is

              John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme."
              Give it a listen, let me know what
              you think, maybe you won't go for it
              now, but it'll get in your head and
              grow like a seed into something
              really beautiful.

              Let's play it now!

                             LENNY
              Later.  Your mom'n I are heading
              right back out.

    Groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from
    Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news.  Cecile even
    musters the gumption to speak up.

                             CECILE
              Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a
              full 24 hours, I have to get ready
              for the party tonight...

                             MACE
              Cecile.

    Mace frosts her with a look.  You don't mess with Mace.

                             MACE
                      (to a disappointed
                       Zander)
              You're not the only little boy I
              have to look out for, honey.

    Zander nods: OK.  Lenny gives him the grip.  Zander's hand
    outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph.

    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE

    POV: squid tape of Iris' death.  Quick barrages of the
    savage imagery interspersed with bursts of static...

    ... until Tick slips off the trodes.  He's been totaled by
    what he's seen.

                             TICK
              Whoa.  That is one unbelievable
              piece of eyefuck.

                             LENNY
              Skip the art criticism, Tick, what
              can you tell me about the wearer.

                             TICK
              Well... the guy's fucked up.

                             MACE
              We know that, Tick.

                             TICK
              No, I mean the killer's got some
              kind of distortion in his visual
              cortex.  The color and gray-scale
              values are all messed up, like color
              blindness.

    He gives the tape a fast run through his processing
    equipment.

                             TICK
              Lookit, you see the peak period
              ratios there?  Could be some kind of
              tumor or brain lesion or something.
              Some kind of trauma
                      (shaking his head)
              This is not good.  I don't like this
              at all...

                             LENNY
              What?

                             TICK
              Well, it's cutting awful close to
              me.  I mean she was just here.

                             LENNY
              Who was just here?

                             TICK
              Iris, man.  Pay attention.

                             LENNY
              Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris
              was here?!

                             TICK
              Yeah, she came by last night.
              Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to
              make a copy of some clip.

                             LENNY
              What clip?  What was it?

                             TICK
              I don't know, man, she wouldn't let
              me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to
              see it.  She said she was going to
              give it to you to hold for her.
              Like insurance or somethin'

                             LENNY
              She never gave me a tape.

                             MACE
                      (to Lenny)
              Think back about what she said.
              Exactly what she said.

                             LENNY
                      (revved up)
              She wanted to go out to my car,
              something about my car...

                             MACE
              Something in your car...

    Lenny and Mace swap a look: oh shit.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO IMPOUND YARD - DUSK

    6:05  P.M.

    The last night of this millennium is falling.  Mace's limo
    pulls to the curb.  The yard is located in the vast no-
    man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near
    harbor piers.  The impound office is locked.  Closed for
    New Years Eve.

    CUT TO Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with
    the long-handled bolt-cutters.  They enter the yard.  Mace
    is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun.  A
    TAZER.

    Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows
    at them, growling, its head low on an attack run.  Mace
    fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low
    amperage, not lethal).  It whines and flips over twice,
    then runs off behind some parked cars.

                             LENNY
              That's a handy little attitude
              adjuster.
                      (sees his car)
              Damn.  I'm boxed in.

    Lenny and Mace approach his BMW, blocked in by ten other
    cars, so he's not getting it back this trip.  He unlocks
    the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace
    covers them with the tazer.  A puppy-like whine comes
    occasionally from behind some cars nearby.  We catch a
    glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them
    warily.

    Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side,
    still wrapped in the note.  He reads the note: "HELP ME.
    IRIS."

                             MACE
              What's it say?

    He crumples the note.

                             LENNY
              Nothing.  Let's go play this back.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo.  As they
    reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams.  It is
    the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but
    looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and
    Mace.  They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or
    later he would lead them to the tape.

                             SPREG
              Give me the tape.  Right now.

                             LENNY
              What tape?  I'm just trying to get
              my car back but the place is
              closed--

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up Nero.

    Engelman grabs a fist-full of hair at the top of Mace's
    head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull.

                             MACE
                      (cool and even)
              Lenny, give them the tape.

                             LENNY
              It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going
              to open my case...

                             ENGELMAN
              Facing us, where we can see it.

    Lenny slowly opens the Haliburton.  He takes out the tape
    and holds it out toward Spreg.

                             LENNY
              Take it and turn her loose.  Okay?

                             SPREG
              Absolutely.

    And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that
    way.  Spreg edges forward and takes the tape.  Then he
    points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire--

    Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through
    the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into
    Engelman's leg.  Engelman screams in pain.  Mace twists
    out of his grip.  Engelman shoots the dog.

    Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and
    dives for the car.  The case takes three rounds from
    Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover.

    Mace just seems to vanish.  She reappears over the trunk
    of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's
    chest, knocking him down.  Lenny and Mace scramble into
    the car, starting it up.

    Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body
    armor stopped the slugs.  No blood.  He comes up firing.
    He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it
    pulls away.  No damage.  They realize the limo is a bullet
    proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked
    nearby, to give chase.

    Spreg's face is a mask of rage.  He slams the truck in
    gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even
    has the door closed.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  LIMO AND SAN PEDRO STREET - NIGHT

    Mace has the big car floored.  She looks in the rear-view
    as the truck gains on them.  Mace is doing her thing...
    what she's trained for.  Security driving.  She whips some
    moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them.

                             LENNY
                      (holding on)
              Oh no, we're not being followed,
              Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.

    They hear rounds hitting the car, and look back.  The
    truck is right behind them.

                             LENNY
              Shit!

                             MACE
              Take it easy.  The glass is bullet
              resistant.

                             LENNY
              Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened
              to bullet proof?

                             MACE
              Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I
              do.

    THE LIMO slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a
    parked van.  Mace accelerates.  The truck stays with them.

    Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an
    AK-47 assault rifle.  He rips off several burst which
    riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns.
    The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the
    rounds don't come all the way through.

    Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them.  The impact
    drives them sideways.  Mace swerves to miss a light-
    standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse
    buildings which front the harbor.

    The truck stays right with them.  Engelman fires bursts at
    the tires, shredding them off the rims.  The limo thunders
    along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange
    sparks.

    Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings.  No way to
    turn.  Ahead is a short concrete pier.  She hits the
    brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier,
    stopping before it reaches the end.

    They are trapped.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO PIER - NIGHT

    Engelman and Spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover
    behind it.  They rake the limo with bursts from their AK-
    47s.

    INSIDE THE CAR.  Lenny and Mace keep their heads down
    below the door frame.  It sounds like they are inside a
    steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band.  But the
    armored body panels hold.

    Lenny is punching his cellular.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!

                             MACE
              It's okay, Lenny
                      (he looks at her
                       hopefully)
              They'd never get here in time
              anyway.

    Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door
    on her side (away from the bad guys).  It is jammed from
    the sideswiping.

    Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a
    gallon gas can.  He uncaps it and throws it across the
    pavement.  It slides under the limo, glugging its contents
    onto the ground.  Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the
    seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it.

    He tosses the flare under the limo...

    KA-WHOOMPH!!  The gas can explodes in a fireball.  The
    Continental is engulfed in flames.  From the inside all
    Lenny and Mace can see is fire.  All the windows are
    covered in roaring flames.

                             MACE
                      (matter-of-fact)
              This is bad.

                             LENNY
              The gas tank's going to go any
              second!

    Mace slams the car into gear and floors it.  The powerful
    Lincoln thunders forward.  It crashes through a chain-link
    fence and launches right off the end of the pier.  A
    fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black
    water.

    Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact.  The car
    sinks.

    UNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting
    there amid the junk.  Shafts of light play down from the
    big streetlights at the end of the pier.

    INSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb.

                             LENNY
              Are you out of your fucking mind?!

                             MACE
              Fire's out, isn't it?

    She scrambles into the back seat.  She wrenches at the
    rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half-into the
    huge trunk.  Water is up around their legs.  She grabs her
    shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge.

                             MACE
              Get in here.  Come on Lenny, move
              it.  MOVE!!

    Mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in.

                             MACE
              Get ready to hold your breath.

    She aims the ten-gauge at the trunk latch mechanism.

                             MACE
              Lenny, kick out hard, then just
              follow me. Okay?

    He nods.  BLAM!!  She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel.
    The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles.  Lenny
    and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier.

    ON THE SURFACE: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside
    the slimy concrete wall.  Lenny comes up beside her,
    spluttering.  Her hand goes over his mouth.  They are in
    the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road
    ties.

    Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the
    black water over the barrels of their AKs.

                             SPREG
              Let's get out of here.

    They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there.

    Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier,
    chest-deep in the water.  They hear the truck pulling
    away.  They let out a big exhalations of relief.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE walking on the pier, shoes
    squishing.  They leave a shiny trail behind them.

                             MACE
              I can't believe we had to give them
              the damn tape.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my
              favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot
              tub on my birthday.  I'm going to
              really miss it.

    He feels around in his jacket pocket.  He pulls out the
    MYSTERY TAPE... nice and dry in its plastic case.  He
    holds it up to show a grinning Mace.

                             LENNY
              Are we impressed yet?

    INT./ EXT.  FREEWAY AND CURTIS' CAR - NIGHT

    7:45  P.M.

    Lenny and Mace, still wet, riding in the back seat of
    Curtis' car.

                      (pissed)
              I got better things to do on New
              Year's Eve than be some kinda damn
              chauffeur...

                             MACE
              Hey Curtis?  Just drive.

    Curtis swears.  But he shuts up and drives.

                             LENNY
              Those two guys were cops.

                             MACE
              You sure?

                             LENNY
              It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway,
              they'll run your plates and get your
              address.  We gotta keep moving.

    Mace takes it in.  She nods.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MACE'S HOUSE

    Mace comes in the front door and walks straight to the TV,
    switching it off.  Zander and Cecile are shocked.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, girl... what's going on?

    Lenny goes past them and starts grabbing his stuff...
    wardrobe bag, playback gear.

                             MACE
                      (to Zander)
              We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey.
              We're going to watch fireworks from
              there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.

                             ZANDER
              Aw, Mom!

                             LENNY
              Come on Zander.  You can ride on my
              shoulders.  Here you go.

    Lenny hoists him overhead and goes out the door.  Cecile
    catches up to Mace in the hall, just as she is opening a
    locked cabinet and pulling out a little .380 auto, holster
    and ammo.

                             MACE
              Cecile, get in the car.  Now.

    INT./ EXT.  STREET AND CIVIC - NIGHT

    Sirens pierce the night.  Two pillars of fire are visible
    blocks away.  There are dark crowds of people everywhere.
    People on the sidewalks, lighting fireworks.  There are
    flashes and explosions.  It could be a celebration, or a
    war zone.  Maybe both.  Or one about to turn into the
    other.

    Mace is driving, scanning the streets.  She has her .380
    auto in her hand, resting in her lap.  Lenny is riding
    shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back
    seat.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    It is gang territory pure and simple.  Blacks and
    Hispanics.  Graffiti everywhere.  Burned-out buildings.
    Lenny sees abject poverty, here.  Even so, people are
    partying.

    They pull up to the front of Cecile's apartment building
    and get out.

    There are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who
    give Mace the local hand-sign.  She returns the sign
    automatically as she carries Zander past them.

                             ONE OF THE BOYS
              Yo, Mace.  Whatup wit you, homegirl?
              You never come roun' here no more.

    Lenny follows with his wardrobe bag.  The homeboys give
    Lenny the eye as he brushes past them.  Mace chills them
    with a glare.

                             MACE
              He's with me.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    A small and dingy place.  Cecile has done her best to make
    it a home.

    Mace and Lenny go into the kitchen and shut the door.

    He quickly sets up his playback deck on the table.  He
    puts on the trodes and pulls the tape out of his pocket.
    Then he pauses, looking at it apprehensively... knowing
    that it contains the answer to all this madness.

    He puts it into the deck.  The deck closes.  He punches
    PLAY.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

    Mace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis on
    the balcony of the apartment... visible through the
    window.  Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic
    weapons, making her flinch.  She goes back into the...

    KITCHEN.  Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table,
    trodes in his hands.  Stunned.  Face the color of old
    cement.  Hands shaking.

                             MACE
              Tell me.

                             LENNY
              I can't tell you.  You've got to
              see.

                             MACE
              Uh unh.  I won't do it.

                             LENNY
              Mace.  I know what you think about
              the wire.  But I'm asking you to do
              this.  It's that important.

    Mace sees how serious he is.  She nods: OK.  He puts the
    trodes on her.

                             LENNY
              Sorry this has to be your first
              playback.

    He hits play and Mace reacts as the sensory input hits
    her.  She opens her eyes...

                             LENNY
              Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see
              double.

    She bites her lip as the sensation of being another person
    floods through her.

    POV SEQUENCE: We are Iris.  Riding in a car.  Fixing our
    makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor.  Iris
    flips the sun visor back up, revealing the moving street.
    It is night.

    We look down, and recognize the dress Iris was wearing
    when we first saw her, two nights ago.  She puts her
    lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist.  Iris
    turns her head and we see the driver.

    It is JERIKO ONE.  He is laughing, talking to someone in
    the back seat.  Iris looks and we see REPLAY, Jeriko's
    sideman, and another woman, DIAMANDA.  They are amorously
    entwined.  Then they are all laughing and passing around a
    bottle of Jim Beam.  The car stereo is thumping loudly.

    Iris' POV swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's
    hand caressing her thigh.  She puts her hand on his chest
    and leans close to him.  Jeriko grins, then looks up and
    swears at a wash of red/blue cop flash.

                             JERIKO
              Shit.  Fuckin' Five-O

    Our POV swings to the rear-view mirror and we see an LAPD
    car behind us, with the gumball machine on.  A spotlight
    hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren.  Jeriko
    pulls over, but they are on an overpass... no shoulder.

                             COP VOICE
                      (on bullhorn)
              Go to the bottom of the ramp.

    Jeriko and Replay are both swearing.  He pulls the car
    down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a
    warehouse district.  Our POV looks around nervously.
    Black shadows and concrete pillars.  No-one around.  Cars
    whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on
    Mars.  The car is stopped next to a train yard.  We hear
    the rumble of diesels nearby, the clank of freightcars.

    We see the outlines of TWO COPS advancing through the beam
    of the spotlight, their guns drawn.

                             JERIKO
                      (jumping out of the
                       car)
              Goddamn, now what you pull me over
              for?  If I was going any slower I'd
              be parked--

                             COP VOICE 1
              Get down on your knees and put your
              hands on your head.  Now!

                             COP VOICE 2
              Everyone else, out of the car and
              down on the ground.

    Our POV comes up and out of the car.  Jeriko is
    righteously pissed off.  He's not following orders.

                             COP VOICE 1
              Put your hands behind your head
              right now!

    He goes along, madder than ever.  The cops get Replay down
    on his knees as well, in the wet gutter next to the curb.

    The cops are closer now.  We see that they are SPREG and
    ENGELMAN.

                             ENGELMAN
                      (to us)
              Put your hands on the hood of the
              car and don't move.

    We exchange a look with Diamanda.  Fucking cops.  But
    Jeriko is winding them up.  Not giving them the pleasure
    of the humiliation.  You can see it escalating.

                             JERIKO
              I suppose you stopped us cause you
              had suspects fitting our description
              in the area, what you're gonna tell
              me.  What was the description?  Two
              black males in a car?  Yeah, right,
              I heard that one before...

    As Engelman pulls out Jeriko's wallet, looks at his ID,
    Jeriko checks name tags.

                             JERIKO
              Well you stopped the wrong black
              male tonight officer... what is it?
              Spreg.  Officer Spreg.  Cause I'm
              the 800 pound gorilla in your mist,
              fucker.  I make more in a day than
              you make in a year, and my lawyers
              love to spend my money dragging
              sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you
              into court.  Get a man down on the
              ground with no probable cause.  Fuck
              you!

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up!

    He kicks Jeriko down on his face.  Jeriko hits the ground
    hard.

                             DIAMANDA
                      (yelling)
              Leave the fuck off of us, we weren't
              doing anything...

                             SPREG
              Shut up!  Don't make me walk over
              there.

    Engelman shows the ID to Spreg, saying something we can't
    hear.

                             SPREG
              You're that rap puke?  Jeriko One?
              You're the one getting all the
              gangbangers to form citizens groups
              and go downtown... trying to rake
              the LAPD over a cheese grater?

                             JERIKO
              That's right.  And you're gonna be
              in my next song, motherfucker, it's
              called Robo-Spreg.

    Replay starts laughing.  Diamanda stifles a giggle.  Spreg
    is white-lipped with rage.  Years of frustration coming to
    a head.  Too many disciplinary actions, too many
    suspensions, too little appreciation of the tough job they
    do.

                             JERIKO
              It's a song about a cop who meets
              his worst nightmare, a nigger with
              enough political juice to crush his
              ass like a stink bug.  You're gonna
              be famous.

    Spreg looks around the empty street.  Looks at Engelman.
    Down at Jeriko, proned out on the pavement.  Replay's
    laughter in his ears.

                             SPREG
              I don't think so.

    And shoots him BLAM!  BLAM!  Twice in the back of the
    head.  Just like that.

    Diamanda screams.  Replay tries to roll to his feet.
    Spreg shoots him twice in the stomach.  Replay is
    screaming.  Rolling around, holding his guts.

                             SPREG
                      (shouting)
              Hey... I don't hear you laughing!

    Engelman's yelling something at him we can't hear.  Spreg
    turns, eyes wide with adrenaline.

                             SPREG
              Get the bitches.

    Engelman hesitates and then spins toward us.  Diamanda is
    screaming, backing away from Engelman.  Spreg shoots
    Replay four more times.

    We spin one-eighty and start to run.  Hear shots... BLAM!
    BLAM!  BLAM!  Spin back... to see Diamanda dropping to her
    knees.  Engelman shoots her again.  Then raises his gun
    toward us.

    We spin away.  The world becomes a kinetic blur.  The
    sound of shots.  We see puffs of dust on the ground in
    front of us.  Missed shots.  We tumble over a guardrail
    and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running.

    Train tracks ahead.  Looking back... here come Spreg and
    Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us.  We hear the
    thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward.
    Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track.  Almost to
    us.

    We leap forward.  Over the track.  The diesel roars past
    behind us.  Looking back... a black wall of moving steel.
    Backing away from it.

    We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim
    through the wheels.  Hear the impotent pop of their guns
    over the roar of the train.

    Turning to run again.  We see a tiny hole appear in a sign
    right in front of us with a metallic SPANG.  Running and
    running.

    Looking back.  No pursuit.  Train still rolling by.  Can't
    see the cops.  Running, running.  Heart pounding and lungs
    heaving.  Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to
    fill the night.

    Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off.  Iris' hand
    takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest.
    We move forward into the dark train-yard as--

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    And Mace sits stone still.  Shakes.  For a beat.  And
    another.  Then she tears the trodes off and throws them
    across the room, near where Lenny is on the cellular.

                             LENNY
                      (into phone)
              Hang on.  Hang on, Max.
                      (looks at Mace)
              You see?

                             MACE
              I see.
                      (trembling)
              I see the earth opening up and
              swallowing us all.

                             LENNY
              Yeah I know.
                      (into cellular)
              So what do we do?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MAX'S CAR - NIGHT

    As Max drives along a crowded downtown street.

                             MAX
                      (into phone)
              Don't talk to anybody.  Anybody.
              You're invisible.  Okay?  Just meet
              me at Tick's in a half hour.  And
              Lenny... don't get pulled over.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny pushes "End" on his cellular and looks at Mace.  The
    first-time impact of the Squid experience, and the killing
    of Jeriko, still haunts her.  We've never seen Mace
    scared.  But she looks scared now.

                             LENNY
              We got to make another copy of this.
              Little life insurance.

                             MACE
              You know what this tape could do if it
              gets out.

                             LENNY
                      (tucking Glock in
                       his waistband)
              I've got a good idea, yeah.

                             MACE
              People finding out... seeing... that
              the LAPD just flat out executed
              Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they
              ought to see.

                             LENNY
              Maybe.  But tonight is probably not
              the best night.  Come on, we're
              rollin'.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Cecile catches them on the steps as they are leaving.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, when you gonna stop laying
              off everything on me?  We had plans
              tonight--

                             MACE
                      (steely)
              Listen to me, little sister.
              There's something going on, and it's
              very big.  Now you've got to take
              care of Zander.  And stay off the
              streets tonight... you hear me on
              this?

    Cecile gets the message.  She nods.

                             MACE
              Curtis.  What about you?  Do we
              understand each other?  You stay
              put.

                             CURTIS
              Yeah.  I'm wit it.

    Mace and Lenny go on down the steps to the car.

                             CURTIS
                      (to Cecile)
              Damn!  She worse than you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  CIVIC AND STREET - NIGHT

    Lenny and Mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver
    the dark streets.  Xenon searchlights crisscross the
    rooftops nearby.  They see patrol cars passing on cross-
    streets, lights flashing.  It feels like the entire LAPD
    is looking for them.

    Everywhere in the street there are small crowds, street
    parties in progress.  People drinking and firing bottle
    rockets.  The police watch everything.

                             LENNY
              So, let's see, I've got Tran's
              goons, some squidhead psycho and the
              LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy
              new year, Lenny.

                             MACE
              Well, look at the plus side.

                             LENNY
              There's a plus side?

                             MACE
              Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape
              to save me.  That's real progress
              for you.

                             LENNY
              It was a tough call.

                             MACE
              I still can't square the psycho
              smarts of whoever did Iris with
              those two cops.

                             LENNY
              I don't think those cops did Iris.
              I think whoever Iris was wearing for
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Why?

                             LENNY
              To break the trail.  If those cops
              had gotten hold of her, they would
              have beat it out of her who she was
              wearing for, and then gone after
              them too.  Our killer is running as
              scared as we are.  Which makes him
              really dangerous.  Judging by how
              scared I am.

    They pull up to the checkpoint; Lenny squirrels into the
    seat, hiding in the shadows, as Mace flashes her security
    pass and the cop waves them on.

    Lenny lets his breath out slowly.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE/TICK'S VAN

    Lenny and Mace pull in with a SQUEAL of brakes and park
    the car.  Sound of rock music -- some kind of refried
    psychedelia -- coming from Tick's van down the ramp.

    Mace and Lenny get out, approaching the van.  Hearing
    tires squeal, they turn to see Max pull up.  He gets out
    wearing an ill-fitting rental tux.  Music louder, echoing
    in the empty garage, even though the van is shut tight.

                             MAX
              Sounds like Tick's already
              celebrating.

                             LENNY
              You may be a little overdressed for
              this party.
                      (Lenny pounds on the
                       van door)
              Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!

    Mace slips out her .380, on alert.

                             LENNY
                      (knocks again, then opens
                       rear van door)
              Tick, I got to talk to you, man...
              oh shit.

    Tick's slumped in the back of the van with playback trodes
    on his head.  He's breathing, but otherwise he's still.
    Near lifeless.  A cyborg after a power outage.  All the
    equipment in the van is trashed.

                             LENNY
                      (as he starts to
                       examine Tick)
              He's been cooked-off

                             MAX
              Is he dead?

                             LENNY
              No.  But his frontal lobes are like
              two runny eggs.  They put an
              amplifier in-line to boost the
              signal till it french-fried his
              brain.

    Mace hits "Off" on the built-in CD player.  The sudden
    silence is creepy.  Lenny gets right in front of Tick's
    eyes, shouting at him, at the top of his lungs.

    TICK'S POV: We see a roaring blizzard of inchoate static.
    Somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of Lenny's
    face, almost invisible.  We hear the tiniest ghost of his
    voice, like a radio playing two blocks away.

                             LENNY
              He's totally cut off from the outer
              world.

                             MACE
              How long does it last?
                      (off Lenny's look)
              Oh.

                             MAX
              Those two psycho cops are on a
              slash-and-burn to find the tape and
              cover their tracks.

                             MACE
              This seems a little sophisticated
              for them.  These are not subtle
              guys.

                             MAX
              There's more to this whole thing
              than you think.

                             LENNY
              Whattya mean?

                             MAX
              All I'm saying... you don't know how
              high up the food chain this thing
              goes.  I've heard stuff.

                             LENNY
              What stuff?

                             MAX
              Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff
              about a death squad.  A group a guys
              loyal to the hardline school.  Guys
              that've had too many years of city
              hall and the review boards and the
              goddamn media pissing down their
              necks, suspending cops right and
              left, tying their hands... while
              outa the other side a their mouths
              these same people're squealing save
              us, save us, do something you
              fucking morons, crime is totally out
              of control.

    Lenny takes this in.  All the fight goes out of him.  This
    is just too overwhelming.

                             LENNY
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  So don't walk near me in
              public, alright.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, buddy.  See... things
              weren't bad enough.  They weren't
              fucking bad enough!

                             MACE
              The only card we have to play is the
              tape.  You know, we get it to the
              media somehow...

                             LENNY
              Yeah, right, blow it open.

                             MAX
                      (interrupting)
              Mace... no disrespect... but you run
              this on the 11 o'clock news, by
              midnight you got the biggest riot in
              history.  They'll see the fucking
              smoke from Canada.

                             LENNY
              Okay... what about Strickland?

                             MAX
              No.  Bad idea.

                             MACE
              Who's Strickland?

                             LENNY
              Deputy Commissioner Palmer
              Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick
              who busted me out.  His ass is so
              tight when he farts only dogs can
              hear it.  I know this guy.  If
              there's one cop who's not dirty
              it's him.

                             MAX
              Listen to me, Lenny... stay away
              from cops.  All cops.  You have no
              way of knowing who you can trust.

    Mace looks from one to the other with a growing expression
    of outrage.

                             MACE
              So you're saying we just pretend is
              didn't happen?  It happened!  The
              LAPD executed one of the most
              important black men in America!  Who
              the fuck are you to bury this?!

                             MAX
              Fine.  Do you want blood running
              waist deep in the storm drains?  The
              gangbangers'll spread like a wave
              through this city and burn it to the
              ground.  And when the fires start
              the street cops'll be capping off at
              anything that moves.  It'll be all-
              out war and you know it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, well maybe it's time for a
              war!

                             MAX
              You really want that on your head?

                             LENNY
              Hey, Max, Mace... whoa... time out.

                             MAX/MACE
                      (together/annoyed)
              What!?

                             LENNY
              Whoever killed Iris did Tick.  It's
              the same sick wirehead shit.  Same
              reason... to burn the trail.  If
              Faith knows anything about this, and
              I think she does, then she's on the
              list.  So... who's driving?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Roadies are loading out gear through the back doors of the
    club into a van in the alley.  Lenny and Mace ENTER FRAME
    and we follow them between the roadies, going through the
    doors into...


    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    A grungy black corridor.  The thunder of music gets louder
    with each step as Lenny and Mace walk down the corridor
    with purposeful strides.

    Through chainlink partitions and banks of dark equipment,
    Lenny catches glimpses of the stage.  He can see Faith in
    a blue-white spotlight.  She is a whirling dervish,
    convulsing with the divine madness of her music.  Beyond
    her, beyond the lights, in the gloom... Lenny can just see
    Tran and his entourage.  Dressed in tuxes, they look out
    of place... clearly on their way somewhere else as the
    evening progresses.

    Faith whirls to a stop as the band crashes in a final
    downbeat.  The spotlight goes out and the set is over.

    ON TRAN, clapping.  Watching.

    NEARBY, Max arrives through the crowd, scanning for
    Tran... spotting him.

    BACKSTAGE... FAITH, bathed in sweat, walking along a dark
    corridor backstage.  WE TRACK WITH HER, as she walks
    through the shadows, like a fighter returning from the
    ring, soaked and breathing hard.

    A HAND shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth,
    pulling her into the shadows.  Terrified for a split
    second... before she recognizes that it is Lenny.  He
    pulls her into the room and closes the door.  It is Tex
    Arcana's VJ control room, full of monitors and constantly
    changing graphic images.  Tex is not there.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!  Jesus!  You scared the Hell
              out of me.

    Faith sees that Mace is standing there, in the shadows,
    waiting.  She turns back to Lenny with a frown.

                             FAITH
              What's going on?

                             LENNY
              Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris
              made me a copy of the tape.

                             FAITH
              Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep
              you out of this.

    But she seems relieved now that he knows, now that there
    is someone to talk to.

                             LENNY
              How did it happen?  What was Iris
              doing riding around with Jeriko
              wearing a wire?

                             FAITH
              We should talk alone.

                             LENNY
              No.  Mace is in this.

                             MACE
              Tell us.

                             FAITH
              Tran's gotten obsesses with
              playback, a total wiretrip junkie.
              And he's such a control freak, he's
              been having people followed,
              videotaped... recording his business
              partners' calls.  Wiring up people
              left and right.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CLUB/MAIN FLOOR

    Tran looks at his watch and gets up from the table,
    impatient.

                             TRAN
              Let's go get her.  We're late.

    Max shows up suddenly, right in front of him.  Stopping
    him.

                             MAX
              Tran, listen.  I was wondering how
              you want me to work it tonight, down
              at the Bonaventure.  You want me
              downstairs at the party or upstairs
              at the suite?  Where you going to
              be, mostly?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    While Max stalls, Faith talks.

                             FAITH
              Tran and Jeriko weren't getting
              along.  He was afraid Jeriko was
              getting ready to dump him, but he
              wasn't sure, so he started with the
              surveillance.  A couple nights ago
              he wires up Iris and sends her and
              the other girl, Diamanda, over to
              Jeriko's table.

    CUT TO: TWO NIGHTS AGO, Iris, wearing a wig, leaves Tran's
    table with Diamanda and moves toward... a booth in the
    Retinal Fetish where Jeriko One sits with Replay.  Iris
    stands over Jeriko for just a moment.  Then he nods,
    smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in
    the booth right next to him.

                             FAITH
              That night Iris calls up, freaking.
              She comes over and Tran watches the
              tape.  He just loses it.  He can't
              believe the disaster she's gotten
              him into.  He's terrified the cops
              will beat it out of her who she was
              working for, and come looking for
              him.

    CUT TO: TRAN'S LOFT as a tear-streaked and frantic Iris is
    telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her (we
    don't hear).  Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin-
    lipped with rage.  She crumples to the floor, sobbing.
    Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's
    poison.

                             LENNY
              Kinda guy you can count on in a
              pinch.

                             MACE
              Why didn't he just go public with
              the tape?  Save himself that way.

    CUT TO: An image of Tran burning the squid tape.  It
    blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like
    a venomous snake.

                             FAITH
              The scandal would wipe him out.  If
              it got out that he had his own
              artists under surveillance... he'd
              lose all his other acts.  He'd be
              over.

    Now we see Tran, more composed, comforting Iris.  He wipes
    at her tear-streaked face.  Hands her a wad of bills.

                             FAITH
              So finally he gives Iris some cash
              and tells her to check into the
              hotel under a wrong name till he
              figures out what to do.

                             LENNY
              Yeah... he figured out what to do
              all right.

                             FAITH
              You think Tran killed her?

                             LENNY
              The killer knew right where she was.
              Because he put her there.

                             FAITH
              What a nightmare.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MAIN FLOOR

    Tran impatiently gestures to Corto.

                             TRAN
              Go get her, Joey.  Stupid bitch.
                      (to Max)
              We'll talk about this later.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    Mace is getting the sixth sense feeling that seconds
    count.

                             MACE
              Come on.  We're out of here.

    Lenny gets close to Faith, taking her face in his hands.

                             LENNY
              Leave here with me, right now.

    Mace sighs heavily, rolls her eyes toward the ceiling.
    Faith considers her options.  Then she smiles at him.

                             FAITH
              Okay, Lenny.  My guardian angel.

    Faith hugs him, and he clutches her.  Mace locks her jaw
    and looks away.  This is hard for her.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR

    Mace leads the way, with Lenny following, gripping Faith's
    hand like Orpheus leading Eurydice out of Hell.  They push
    through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor.
    Half-lit, in alcoves, far-gone wireheads loll in semi-
    consciousness.  Faith looks back and sees:

    TRAN'S POSSE rounding a corner... spotting them.  They
    start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking
    protesting people out of the way.

    Mace, Lenny and Faith break into a run, pounding down the
    corridor.

    Behind them, Duncan leads the charge.  Suddenly TEX ARCANA
    shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path
    with his wheelchair.  Duncan crashes over him, toppling
    the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor.  Vita,
    Beemer and Corto go around the sprawl.

    Tex, like many legless men, has incredibly strong arms.
    Lenny looks back to see him pounding Duncan's head against
    the floor...

                             TEX
              Teach you...
                      (pound)
              to mess with...
                      (pound)
              a helpless cripple!

    Lenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they
    shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobe-flashes and
    a wall of sound.

    Behind them we see Corto and Beemer hurling partiers
    aside, cutting a swath, while Vita moves like a mongoose
    through tall grass.  Mace drops back, going tail-end-
    Charlie... her bodyguard mode kicking in.

    ON LENNY AND FAITH, charging through the jostling crowd,
    Lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and...

    TRAN is right in front of him.  In the whirling shapes and
    colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a
    white tux.  He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the
    bottle in the other.  In one lightning-fast move he
    uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw.
    Faith screams as Lenny staggers.  Tran swings again,
    smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head.  Lenny
    sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass.

    Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see
    Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted
    viciously behind her back.  They go around a chain-link
    divider and double back, heading for the exit.  Lenny
    staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as
    Faith passes within a few inches of him.  He slips down
    the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost
    in the pounding darkness.

    Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a
    cat as the Posse arrives.  She stands guard over him like
    a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering them
    expertly.  Corto eyes her with hatred.  The stitches on
    his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his
    last run-in with her.  He backs off.

                             CORTO
                      (to the others)
              Not here.  Lets go.

    They back off, fading into the crowd... catching up with
    Tran at the exit.

    Mace watches them recede.  Then she bends to Lenny.  Max
    arrives a moment later and they lift him to his feet.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Max and Mace support a semi-conscious Lenny, hustling him
    to the car.  As they are putting him in the car, TWO LAPD
    OFFICERS come through the crowd, eyeing the bleeding
    Lenny.

                             MAX
              Everything's cool.  Too much to
              drink.

    Lenny picks this moment to slump sideways, falling half
    out of the car.  The squid tape of the Jeriko kill falls
    out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement.
    Mace's eyes go wide.  The boot of one of the cops is
    inches from it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, uh... he slipped on the
              stairs.  We're taking him to
              emergency.
                      (to the nearest cop)
              Excuse me.

    The cop steps back, giving Mace room to push Lenny back up
    in the seat.  She surreptitiously kicks the tape under the
    car, over to the driver's side.

                             COP
              Go to Cedars.  It's closest.

    Mace nods and goes around the car.  Max starts asking them
    questions and the cops turn away, distracted.  She picks
    up the tape and gets in.  Closes the door.  Let's out a
    big breath.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  PARKING GARAGE/BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    A line of expensive cars waiting to valet park.  Tran's
    limo jumps the line and swoops up parallel to the elevator
    doors.  The posse get out, scowling at the valet who
    swallows his protest.  Tran emerges, helping Faith out
    with a firm grip on her arm which he does not release as
    they head for the elevators.

    They push through a group waiting for an elevator... men
    in tuxes, women in gowns and diamonds.  The elevator opens
    and Tran's entourage sweeps inside.  Beemer and Duncan
    block any civilians from entering.


    INT.  ELEVATOR

    They ride in silence a moment.  Faith is pale, her jaw
    clenching.  Tran has her arm in a tight grip.  There is a
    march-to-the-gallows feel about the moment.

                             FAITH
              Well, I'm certainly in the mood for
              a party.

                             TRAN
                      (to Wade)
              Take her up to the suite.
                      (to Faith)
              Have a glass of champagne... or
              six... I'll be up in a while to help
              you ring in the New Year.

                             FAITH
              I live for the moment.

    The elevator doors open, revealing...


    INT.  FOYER AND BALLROOM

    The heart of the MILLENNIUM L.A. New Year's ball.  A
    glitterati event in full swing.  Red carpet, minicam
    lights and paparazzi.  Limos pulling up outside four deep.
    Movie stars rubbing elbows with politicos, music movers
    and shakers chatting with city hall types.  This is a
    party to celebrate the millennium, sure, but its main
    function is to celebrate the celebrants: if you're here,
    there's no need to be anywhere else.  There is a heavy
    police presence, as well as lots of private security.

    Tran exits the elevator with Vita Minh, Joey Corto and
    Duncan.  They wedge through the crowd, Tran smiling.
    Nodding to people he knows.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny is in a chair in the kitchen, listening to Max on
    the cellular.  He is holding a dish-towel full of ice
    cubes on his scalp.  It is soaked with blood and his
    Armani jacket and silk shirt are spattered.  Mace lifts
    the ice pack to check that the bleeding has stopped.

                             MACE
              You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass
              motherfucker, you know that?

    She slaps the ice pack back down.

                             LENNY
              Owww!!  Take it easy.
                      (to phone)
              Uh huh.  So where are they now?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BALLROOM/BONAVENTURE HOTEL

    TIGHT ON MAX, leaning against a pillar.  He looks over his
    shoulder, around the column.

    MAX'S POV: through a dense throng of glitterati we see
    Tran and his entourage seated at a table, holding court
    with music types and politicos.

                             MAX
              He's got her up in the room, under
              guard.  And he's still working the
              party... acting smooth like nothin's
              nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work
              a trade.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              What do you mean?

                             MAX
              Give him the tape.  See?  It's
              fucking brilliant!  The tape for
              Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I
              can set it up.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              This is what we laughingly refer to
              as a plan, right?

                             MAX
              Come on!  If he gives us any shit,
              we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?
                      (same old Max)
              Just get your butt down here.  If
              I'm not at the shindig downstairs
              go to the room.  It's 2203.  You
              writin'?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  APARTMENT

    On Lenny, at the table.  He dabs his finger in the blood
    on the ice pack and writes the number on the table top.

                             LENNY
              2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I intend to.

    Lenny punches END.  Mace looks at the number written in
    blood on the white formica.  Her eyes ratchet up, boring
    into Lenny.  Not noticing, he gets up, still woozy, and
    staggers to his wardrobe bag across the room.

                             LENNY
              Okay, we gotta get over there.
                      (opens the bag)
              Can you borrow a dress from Cecile
              or something--

                             MACE
              I'm not going.

                             LENNY
              Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's
              gonna do her right there unless--

                             MACE
              Lenny... shutup.  Just park your
              mouth and listen.  It's a set-up.
              Think about it!  Why's he been
              sending you tapes?  To freak you,
              get you to rush in without thinking.
              Then they put one in you, put one in
              her, put the gun in your hand...
              crime of passion.  This guy's bent
              enough to think of that.

    Lenny nods, hearing what she is saying.

                             LENNY
              That sounds right.
                      (but it changes
                       nothing)
              I'm going.

    He reaches into his wardrobe bag... pulling out the box of
    "Faith" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the
    suit.  Mace's frustration explodes as anger.

    She grabs his shoebox full of tapes.  Holds them up to
    him.

                             MACE
              You gonna get yourself killed for
              this?  This toxic-waste bitch!

    She dumps the box of tapes on the floor.  She starts
    stomping on them with one heel, crunching several into
    junk.

                             LENNY
              What the fuck are you doing?!

    Lenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up, trying to
    stop her, push her away.  They struggle for a pathetic,
    tragic moment.

    Mace snaps.  She grabs him by the lapels and swings him
    around, slamming him back against a wall.

                             MACE
              Lenny!  This is your life, Lenny!
              Right here.  Right now.  This is
              realtime... not playback.  Real...
              time.  Time to get real.  Understand
              what I'm saying... she doesn't love
              you.  Maybe she did once, I don't
              know, but she doesn't now.  These
              are used emotions.  It's time to
              trade them in.

    Mace's tone becomes more gentle.  We see that her outburst
    is, beneath it all, coming from a place of compassion.

                             MACE
              Lenny, memories were meant to fade.
              They're designed that way for a
              reason.

    Lenny seems to crumple.  He knows he has to let go.  But
    it is so painful.

                             LENNY
              Have you ever been in love with
              somebody who didn't return that
              love?

    Mace gives him a look like, jeez Lenny, are you dumb
    sometimes.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.

                             LENNY
              It didn't stop you from loving them.
              Right?  Or understanding them, or
              being able to forgive them...

                             MACE
              I guess.

                             LENNY
              And it didn't stop you from wanting
              to protect them.  Did it?

                             MACE
              No.  It didn't.

    Lenny's eyes are brimming with tears.  He makes no attempt
    to hide it... doesn't brush them away.

                             LENNY
              I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent
              Crimes... and I saw every known
              depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In
              outer darkness.  Then I busted this
              strung-out little teeny-hooker.
              When I met Faith she was just
              another runaway giving twenty dollar
              blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost
              soul.

                             MACE
              You never told me.

                             LENNY
              But she was different.  There was a
              light in her eyes... and she had
              this voice.  It was scary, all that
              pain coming out of that little body.
              Like she could take all the hurt and
              rage of the entire world and lift it
              up to heaven in one voice.  I helped
              her.  And I promised her that I'd
              always be there... to protect her.
                      (long pause)
              See?  It's not about what's in her
              head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't
              let go of the promise.  It's...
              like... it's all I have left.

                             MACE
              No, it's not.

    Mace takes his face in her hands.  She kisses him lightly
    on the cheek, where the tear-track is.

                             MACE
              Come on, Lenny.  Let's go to a
              party.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET AND BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    11:07  P.M.

    IT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL PARTIES.  IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see
    there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of
    downtown L.A.  Arc lights sweep the sky.  There are two
    outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.  There are
    lasers, strobe-lights.  People are literally dancing in
    the streets... if they can move at all.  Huge projection
    video screens are set up all over the place.

    LA is connected to other cities all over the world by
    satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time
    zones.  The excitement has been building all evening as
    midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast.
    It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia
    blow-out.

    Madness in the streets.  And Lenny and Mace are stuck in
    it.  The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial
    Mardi Gras.  People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as
    they go by, or press their faces against the glass.  It
    may be the party of the century, but it looks like the
    middle of a third world revolution.

                             MACE
              That's it.  Let's bail.

    And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the
    protesting horns behind her.  And we see that she's
    wearing a short black cocktail dress.  Lenny comes around
    the car, through the wild crowd.  He's in his other suit.
    Snappy.

    Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her
    .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.  She pulls
    the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between
    her upper thighs.

    In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a
    quarter anywhere on her body.  The dress is cut low at the
    top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular
    legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her
    braids now loose and full, like a mane.

    Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take.  He is
    caught by a sudden realization:

                             LENNY
              Mace... you're a girl.

                             MACE
              Good, Lenny.  I can see why the
              detective gig didn't work out.  Come
              on.

    They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity.
    Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the
    fore.  The whole street is vacuum-packed with people.
    Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an
    unparted Red Sea of man and machine.

    They will move through the various strata of society as
    they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum.  It
    is like all of LA, from poorest to richest, compressed
    into a few square blocks.  There are cops everywhere.
    Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear.

    Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance...
    metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500
    dollar-a-plate ticket.

                             LENNY
              Got your ticket?

                             MACE
              No.  They must have sent it to my
              beach house by mistake.

    Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace
    follows.  They pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty
    feet away, his back to them.

    REVERSE ANGLE: It is SPREG.  His black eyes scan the
    crowd.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN

    ON LENNY AND MACE moving with purpose through the vast
    steaming factory of the kitchen where a thousand dinners
    are being prepared.  They are ignored by the bustling
    staff.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Lenny and Mace emerge from a service door into the
    glitterati crowd, heading into the ballroom.

    They scan the room.

                             LENNY
              You see Tran?

                             MACE
              Uh unh.

    Lenny whips out his cellular and recalls Max's number.  He
    hears the phone connect.  It starts to ring.

    LENNY'S POV... as the crowd parts for a moment.  He sees
    PALMER STRICKLAND talking to a city-hall type.  Lenny
    turns away before Strickland sees him.

                             LENNY
                      (to the ringing
                       phone)
              Come on, Max.  Come on, buddy...
                      (two more rings)
              Damnit.

    He looks around now.  Starting to feel the creeping edge
    of panic.  No Tran.  No Max.

                             LENNY
              Alright.  We're going up.

                             MACE
              And do what?  Take on his whole
              posse?

                             LENNY
              I still got one ace to play.  Tran's
              got what I want... and I've got what
              he wants...

    Lenny pulls the Jeriko tape out of his breast-pocket and
    holds it up.  Mace just stares at him completely outraged.

                             MACE
              That's the original.  There are no
              copies.

                             LENNY
                      (not getting it)
              Exactly.  That's why it's a make-
              able deal.

    Mace gets very, very close to Lenny, and her voice drops
    to an odd, cold... lethal-sounding... growl.

                             MACE
              Look.  That tape is a lightning bolt
              from God.  It's worth more than you,
              more than me, more than Faith.  You
              understand?  It can change things.
              Things that need changing before we
              all go off the end of the road.  And
              you do not have the right to use it
              for currency.
                      (Lenny's eyes are
                       wide)
              You go... you go alone.  This is
              where I draw the line.  I care about
              you Lenny... a lot more than you
              know... which makes us both pretty
              stupid.  But you pawn that tape, you
              mean nothing to me.

    Lenny doesn't know what to say.  Tough choice.  He
    clenches his jaw...

    And turns away.  He strides into the crowd, heading for
    the lobby and the elevators.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  Wanting to run and stop him.
    But she's said what there is to say.  She turns away,
    desolate and churning with emotion.  The moment lengthens
    as she wrestles with it.  You see her fury, her sadness...
    and her protective instincts.  Her resolve fails her.
    Ultimately, she must protect him if she can.

                             MACE
              Ah, hell.  Lenny--

    She turns, running toward the lobby.  And...
    BOOM.  Slams into him.  He came back.

    Lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm.
    Closes her fingers on it.

                             LENNY
              See that guy?
                      (pointing)
              The one with the ramrod up his ass.
              That's Strickland.

    Mace follows his look to Strickland, across the room.

                             LENNY
              Take it to him.

                             MACE
              A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!

                             LENNY
              No.  Trust me.

    He unclips his playback deck from his belt and hands it to
    her.

                             MACE
                      (nodding slowly)
              Oh boy.
                      (she takes a deep
                       breath)
              What if you're wrong?

                             LENNY
              Then we'll be right where we are
              now.

                             MACE
              Yeah, right.  Fucked.

    INT.  BONAVENTURE ELEVATOR

    It is a glass-cage scenic elevator, running up the outside
    of the building.  10th floor.  The last passengers step
    out.  When the doors whoosh closed and Lenny's left alone
    there's only the sound of Muzak Christmas carols.  The
    elevator rises, the lights of LA spread out below.  He is
    hyperventilating.

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Mace threads her way past tables circling a dance floor
    full of dancers and makes her way through celebs air-
    kissing each other.

    But as she gets near Strickland's table, he stands up and
    excuses himself.  He starts toward the men's room.  And
    Mace follows him.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MEN'S ROOM/HOTEL

    A few guys in tuxes tending to themselves.  Strickland
    enters, crossing to a urinal.  He unzips.

    Mace steps up beside him.  Guys behind her looking on,
    slack-jawed.  Mace pays no attention to them.  Strickland,
    stern and flinty-eyed, raises one eyebrow.

                             STRICKLAND
              Yes?

    She puts the playback deck on top of Strickland's urinal.
    He scowls.

                             MACE
              There's a tape in there you need to
              see.  I mean right now.

    While see is looking at Strickland, a young LAPD OFFICER
    comes out of a stall, and goes to the sink.  He glances in
    the mirror at Mace.

                             STRICKLAND
              If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd
              arrest you for possession of illegal
              equipment--

                             MACE
                      (interrupting)
              Just look at the tape!  You want to
              know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in
              the stall right now and hit Play.

    The young cop steps up behind her.

                             YOUNG COP
              Sir, is there a problem here?

    Mace turns.  Oh shit.  She backs away from them.

                             MACE
              Damn!  I knew it--

    Strickland motions with his eyes and the cop grabs for
    her.  Mace twists viciously out of his grip, knocks him
    down and vanishes out the door.

    STRICKLAND hefts the recorder, pondering it.  His
    expression is opaque.

    INT.  HALLWAY/BONAVENTURE HOTEL

    Lenny comes out of the elevator.  Standing at the corner,
    where he can watch the elevators and the corridor, is Wade
    Beemer.  Lenny doesn't break stride.  Just walks toward
    Beemer.  He's not afraid anymore.  He's pissed off.
    Beemer moves toward him.

                             LENNY
              Now, Wade, can we talk here, like
              two human beings--

    We think he's starting the usual negotiation.  But when he
    gets in range he lets fly with a line-drive right,
    straight into Beemer's face.  We're talking a John Wayne
    haymaker punch.  He staggers back, surprised and dazed,
    and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can.

    He drops to his knees, sucking wind.  Lenny draws his
    Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of
    handcuffs off his belt.  Okay, we're starting to believe
    he might have been a cop once.

                             LENNY
              It's not personal.

    INT.  BALLROOM

    Mace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past
    the tables when...

    ... she's grabbed by DUNCAN.  He gets her in a good tight
    come-along.  Like any good security person, the hold is
    not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted.
    VITA MINH steps up next to her, closing ranks.

    MACE IS WALKED around behind the bandstand.  Joey Corto
    walks up to her, looking mean and smug.

    Mace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur.  Her
    open palm breaks Corto's nose with an audible crunch.
    Corto screams and grabs his face.

                             CORTO
              Aw, not the fucking nose!!

    She slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her
    head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt.  He keeps
    the hold.  Mace drives her free hand back into the
    approximate position of his nuts.  Even though Duncan
    looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired
    effect.

    Mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a
    buffet table.  Vita draws a knife in a lightning move
    but...

    Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up
    and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in
    her face.  Vita says the smartest line of the night.

                             VITA
              Hey, enjoy the party.

    Mace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her
    gun innocuously tight to her side.  She spots a red "Exit"
    sign above a fire door and goes through.

    INT.  STAIRWELL AND PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny closes the stairwell door, giving us a quick glimpse
    of Beemer handcuffed to the steel railing.  Lenny moves
    down the empty corridor.

    He approaches suite 2203.  The door is ajar.  Always a bad
    sign.

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace finds herself back in the millennium madness, among
    the street crowd who don't even notice her.  She holsters
    the gun and moves away from possible pursuit.  The sky
    explodes with purple light as huge fireworks go off
    overhead.  A crack like thunder follows.  Then more
    flashes.

    The countdown to midnight has begun.  The party is
    building to a crescendo.  It seems to have a surreal,
    nightmarish quality.  She passes a MIME in a clock suit,
    who keeps adjusting the hands closer to midnight.

    INT.  SUITE 2203

    As Lenny enters the suite.  It is very quiet.  Dark.

    Lenny's heart is pounding.  He moves through the luxurious
    suite, gun in the low-ready position.

    Lenny can barely breathe from the tension.  He notices
    that one balcony door is open.  The roar of the crowd
    comes in like the sound of surf from far below.  Fireworks
    explode across the sky, and the cheers sound like distant
    screams of slaughter.

    His feet crunch on broken glass... a shattered champagne
    bottle.  A lamp is knocked over.  He reaches the door to
    the bedroom and looks in.  The room is empty.  The bed is
    unmade, the bedspread and sheet pulled off.  This isn't
    right.  None of this is right.

    EXT.  STREET PARTY/HOTEL

    Mace is scanning warily as she circles the hotel, looking
    for a way back in.  She turns and sees ENGELMAN in the
    crowd, not twenty feet from her.  He is looking right at
    her.  Not recognizing her for a moment.  Then... he
    realizes who she is.

    He starts toward her and Mace pushes people out of the
    way, breaking into a run.  Engelman charges after her,
    pulling out his rover to call Spreg.

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny looks back at the living room.  Suddenly he notices
    something on the coffee table.  It is an envelope, with
    NERO hand-printed on it.  He is drawn to it, hypnotically.
    He opens it...

    ... and with a nightmarish sense of destiny a SQUID TAPE
    falls out into his hand.

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Now both Spreg and Engelman are stalking Mace through the
    crowd.  Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he
    charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn.  He
    hammers through anybody that gets in his way.

    Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian
    runner.

    Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead
    of her... a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black
    shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a
    doll (New Year's Baby) in the other.  Death watches her
    pass.

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    LENNY, moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on
    his head.  TIGHT ON THE PLAY BUTTON as his finger punches
    down.

    IN POV we approach room 2203.  It is the familiar
    monochromatic vision of the killer.  Our hands open the
    door quietly with a keycard.  We enter the suite.

    Some of the lights are on.  We see Faith out on the
    balcony.  Watching the sea of madness below.  She comes
    back in, carrying an empty champagne glass.  She grabs a
    bottle off an end-table and up-ends it.  Empty.  She hurls
    it across the room, and it shatters against the wall.

    We approach her, standing with her back to us.  Closer.
    Only a few feet now.  She whips around, startled.  Gasping
    loudly.  But then... she recognizes the wearer.

                             FAITH
              Oh.  I didn't hear you come in.

    THE RECORDING STOPS, in a blast of static.  Lenny jerks at
    the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up.

    THE RECORDING RESTARTS: A new image resolves out of
    static.  Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed.  We
    climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps.  We
    turn her onto her back.

    She has been blindfolded.  The Wearer goes SSSHHH.  A
    warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her
    wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at
    the head of the bed.

    The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set
    of trodes.  They are placed on her head... the spidery
    gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair.

    LENNY'S guts have turned to water.  He is shaking his head
    in horror...

                             LENNY
              No, no, no...

    IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  The blade clicks out to its full
    length.

    Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open,
    starting between her breasts and going down out of sight.
    She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.  The
    killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body,
    which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory.  The knife
    deftly cuts off her panties.

    We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her
    hips, pulling her to us.

    ON LENNY, gagging.  Overcome by revulsion and horror,
    mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from
    the tape.

    BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of
    our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck.  Faith begins
    to pant in tiny rapid breaths.  We tighten the belt
    slowly.

    LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his
    stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck,
    he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares
    wildly around the room.

    One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror
    he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is
    covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form,
    propped up against the wall on the far side of the night
    stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom
    door.

    Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of
    the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a
    trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on
    the sheet.

    It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo.

    The last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees
    that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant.
    He looks like Tick did.

    Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The
    fireworks and screaming outside sound like some
    nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an
    end.  But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape.  He
    hits PLAY.

    THE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurches
    with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt.

    Lenny feels the climax building.

    Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out
    herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases
    the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning.

    Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet
    doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of
    the bed and on it Faith.  And on her...

    ... MAX.

    Pants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both
    gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering
    orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly.

    LENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does not
    have the strength or the will to stop the tape.

    IN POV Max's hands remove her blindfold.  She looks right
    at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure.
    Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her.  She reaches
    for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust.  We slump
    forward onto her, and her face fills the POV.

                             FAITH
              I love you.

    Lenny is reeling with these revelations.  His best friend
    is the killer.  And the woman he loved loves him.  But the
    tape is not over...

    THE POV CONTINUES as Max's eyes whip around in response to
    a sound behind them.  The bedroom door is opening.  Tran
    is standing there, stunned.  Maybe the first time he's
    ever been surprised in his life.  What a way to start.

    Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from
    the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle
    right in Tran's face.  We pull him roughly across the
    room, too stunned to resist.

                             TRAN
              You're going to die, you're both
              going to fucking die.

    We slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the
    muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag.  Using
    the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor
    with his back to the mirror.

    Our eyes whip to Faith.  She is freaking out.  We see
    Max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking
    fast.

                             MAX
              This piece of puke hired me to kill
              you, baby.  Do you believe that?
              Isn't that right, Tran?  You
              pinhead.

                             FAITH
              Oh my God.  I don't believe this is
              happening.

                             MAX
              Believe it.  Now bring me the
              trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.

                             FAITH
              What're you going to do?

    Still in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes.  Max
    puts the trodes on Tran's head, then pulls something out
    of his pocket.  It is a booster box.  He plugs it into the
    deck.  He takes the gain control and cranks it all the way
    up.  He's setting up a cook-off.  Tran's eyes go wide when
    he figures that out, starts to splutter.

                             FAITH
              You can't just... kill him.

                             MAX
              I'm not.  Just a little poach job.

                             FAITH
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Hey, he was going to kill you.  And
              this ratfuck paid to have Iris
              killed, to save his own sorry ass.

    Tran freaks at that point but Max jams the gun deep into
    his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his
    words.

                             MAX
              You shut the fuck up, right now,
              I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!

    K-BANG!  Faith shrieks, thinking Max shot him.  But it's
    just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this
    has already happened relative to Lenny entering the
    suite).

                             MAX
              Look, baby, it's now of never... the
              guy is a known input junkie, so a
              little OD won't surprise anybody.
              It's the only way we can be
              together.  You know it's true.

                             FAITH
              My God.

    We don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is
    about to happen, or to the realization that she has the
    capacity to let it happen.

                             MAX
              Here's how much I love you, baby.

    She stares, transfixed, as Max reaches for the deck.  He
    punches PLAY.  Max puts his hand over Tran's mouth to
    muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a
    screaming chainsaw of static from Hell.  The screaming
    outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special
    madness.

    The POV turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly
    at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks.  Like the
    fireworks inside Tran's head.

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    Lenny takes off the trodes.  He is wrung out, drenched
    with sweat.  We see that there is a figure standing in the
    doorway behind him.  Lenny turns, not surprised to see Max
    there with his .45 aimed at Lenny's chest.  Max's surgical
    gloves look incongruous with his tux.

                             MAX
              Don't make any assumptions about our
              friendship, Lenny.

    Lenny stands up, slowly.

                             LENNY
              No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know
              you were colorblind, Max.

                             MAX
              Only way I could stand your ties.

    Max moves up to him cautiously, and takes the Glock out of
    Lenny's waistband.

                             MAX
              I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.

                             LENNY
              Where's Faith?

                             MAX
              I sent her to the party.  I figured
              I'd wait up here until you killed
              Tran.

                             LENNY
              What makes you think I'm gonna kill
              Tran?

    Max looks out the window at the fireworks.  Waits for a
    flash, knowing that the bang will follow.  Keeping his own
    .45 on Lenny, he aims Lenny's Glock at the catatonic Tran.
    BLAM!  One right into Tran's forehead.  The crack of
    thunder from the fireworks masks the sound.

                             MAX
              You just did.

                             LENNY
              Jesus!

                             MAX
              You know, statistically that's the
              second most common word people say
              right before they die.  Shit being
              number one.

    Max sticks Lenny's Glock in his waistband, keeping his own
    .45 trained on Lenny.  Lenny knows the next bullet is for
    him.  He does what he does best... talk.

                             LENNY
              So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran
              in, being on his payroll, and shot
              me.

                             MAX
              That's pretty much the way it
              happened.

    CUT TO FAITH in the living room, moving silently up to the
    edge of the door frame.  She looks through the crack
    between the door and the jam.  Her POV: Max with the gun
    on Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering.
              I killed Iris too, didn't I?

                             MAX
              That's right.  They'll find the
              original of her snuff clip in your
              apartment.  The one I left for you
              at the club was a copy.

                             LENNY
              Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do
              Tick too?

                             MAX
              You bet.  Did you like it?

    Lenny drops the cutesy role.

                             LENNY
              So why Max... why d'ya have to do
              Iris?  She never hurt anybody.

    CU FAITH, reacting to this.

                             MAX
              Picture it... I feel like I gotta
              share this with somebody.  It's too
              perfect.

                             LENNY
              I won't say anything.

                             MAX
              I know.  So, I'm working for this
              puke, right?  And he says he'll pay
              me quite large to do the hooker.
              But also I gotta do his bitch
              girlfriend cause she knows the whole
              score and she's totally out of
              control.

    Lenny nods.  Starting to see it.

                             MAX
              Only he doesn't know about me and
              Faith.  So I say to myself, if I
              turn the job down, he just gets
              somebody else.  And I lose Faith...
              to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I
              do the skank.  I still gotta do
              something about Tran... I figure
              it's him or me... but I can't cap
              him without a chump to take the
              fall.  And who better than his
              girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a
              known criminal... who has been seen
              hassling them in public numerous
              times.

                             LENNY
              And who was, regrettably, also your
              best fucking friend.

                             MAX
              No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey,
              cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten
              minutes anyway.

                             LENNY
              You must be so pleased, I followed
              your jellybean trail right here,
              like a good little chump.

                             MAX
              You got froggy on me a couple times.

    CUT TO: The Underground Garage, where Tick has been
    cooked-off.  We see Max running his number on Mace and
    Lenny.  Lenny buying it.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I thought that riff about the Death
              Squad was pretty good.  I hadda keep
              you from bringing the cops into it.

    AND BACK again to REAL TIME.

                             LENNY
              So there never was a death squad.

                             MAX
              Naawww.

                             LENNY
              Just those two loose-cannon cops
              running around covering their butts.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this
              shit caused by a random traffic
              stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing.
              You know that.  Look around... the
              whole planet's in total chaos.  You
              gotta take what you can, while you
              can.  Cause some shitbird can come
              up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back
              a your head any second.

    CUT TO: A brief, violent flash from the Jeriko tape: Spreg
    shoots Jeriko.

                             LENNY
              How did you hook up with Faith?

                             MAX
              This dink hires me a month ago to
              eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows
              me from you, right, so she comes up
              to me and says, 'Hey Max why you
              following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you
              a drink and explain.' And she says...

                             FAITH
              'So, do you enjoy watching me?'

    Max turns and sees her in the doorway.

                             MAX
              You were supposed to go downstairs,
              baby.

                             FAITH
              I know.  I don't always do exactly
              what I'm told.
                      (she walks slowly
                       toward them)
              So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching
              me?'  And you said -- come on Max.

                             MAX
              I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for
              free.'

                             FAITH
              Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good,
              because I like the feeling of
              someone watching me.  I acquired
              the taste from Lenny.'

    Lenny looks between Faith and Max, feeling like the
    asshole of the western world.  Faith moves up close to
    Max.  She puts her hands lightly on his shoulders,
    caressing them.  Max grins, realizing she is 100% with
    him.

                             MAX
                      (to Lenny)
              And then she said, 'Since we're
              going to be spending so much time
              together--'

                             FAITH
              'We might as well make the best of
              it.'

                             LENNY
                      (crushed)
              Jesus, Faith.

    Faith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders
    and arms.  Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in
    both hands and deflects the gun.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!!

    Lenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun.  Faith pulls
    the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the
    room.

                             MAX
              Fucking bitch!!

    BLAM!  BLAM!  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who
    is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith
    grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away...

    His "hair" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig,
    containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to a
    Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with
    effort as he struggles with Lenny.

    He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES
    of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith,
    screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards.
    The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on
    them from above.

    Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one
    advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry.
    Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into
    the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room,
    falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand
    against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces
    Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops
    the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a
    split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters
    under the couch, out of play.

    Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut,
    and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the
    wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious
    punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes
    down to one knee.

    Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws
    a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away
    from the downthrust.

    The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into
    the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away,
    pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles
    him and they crash together through a sliding glass door
    onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass.

    Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him
    backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny
    twists with all his strength and spins Max into the
    railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and
    Max topples.

    As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him
    over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious
    crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny
    has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he
    is being strangled by the tie.

    Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with
    his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the
    handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max
    sees it coming a split second before it happens.

    Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's
    hands.

    Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12
    stories down, on top of a video truck.

    Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his
    jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All
    the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor.
    Fireworks continue to boom across the sky.

    Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his
    quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the
    bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her.

    He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps
    walking.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    DOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with
    Spreg as he searches for Mace.  He sees her from behind,
    walking near one of the stages.  He moves up behind her,
    aiming his pistol at the back of her head.  She turns
    and...

    ... it isn't Mace.  Another girl in a similar dress.
    Spreg curses and looks around.

    Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to
    her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his
    baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people
    out of the way as he runs.

    Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people
    out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes
    from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look.

    Spreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned
    out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register above
    the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the
    shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people
    block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd.

    ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting
    tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload his
    pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the
    tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt
    of her pistol.

    Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across
    her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace
    bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her
    palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal.
    Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of his
    hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops
    to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe.

    A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She
    spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he can
    fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg,
    using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his
    neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt.

    She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He
    convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping
    like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes
    over and kicks his gun away.

    She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares at
    her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises
    the baton.

                             MACE
              All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!

    He slowly drops to the pavement, face down.  Now that
    she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one
    of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's.

    The crowd of partiers stares.  Can't believe what they're
    seeing.  Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other
    wrist to the base of the tower.  That's when THREE LAPD
    COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and
    see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a
    police baton.  The cops advance toward her.

                             MACE
              Wait.  Let me tell you what's going
              on here--

    The nearest shoots her with a tazer.  She spasms and goes
    to her hands and knees.  One of the cops kicks her down.
    She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the
    breath as the batons start to fall.  The crowd around them
    watches fascinated, gasping.

    Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg.

                             MACE
              NO!!  NO!!!

    They crack her with their batons, telling her to stay
    down.  Another one kicks her in the stomach.

    A BLACK KID in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking
    cops.

    And then they come out of the crowd... one, then three,
    then half a dozen.  Just normal people... black, white,
    Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more.
    They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down.
    It becomes a brawl.

    Then cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the
    trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot-
    gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a
    space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above,
    like the divine light of God.

    Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up.
    Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on
    the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settled
    down.

    Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland
    and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene.
    Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and
    Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still
    handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat
    extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses.
    Then...

    He points at the two prone cops.

                             STRICKLAND
                      (to the nearest
                       officers)
              These two are under arrest for
              murder.

    Strickland looks Spreg in the eye and holds up Lenny's
    squid tape.  Spreg and Engelman react, knowing they are
    over.  The helicopter Xenon gives the whole moment an
    otherworldly quality.  Like they are in some celestial
    court of judgment.

                             STRICKLAND
              Get some medical attention for this
              woman.

    Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland.  He runs to
    Mace and kneels next to her.

                             LENNY
              Are you okay?

    A trickle of blood runs down her face.  She nods weakly
    and reaches for him.  They hug, then they both wince in
    pain.  Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and
    Engelman.  One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower.

                             MACE
              I got 'em, Lenny.

    ENGELMAN LUNGES, grabbing a gun from the holster of the
    closest cop.  He waves them back with it.  Then puts it in
    his mouth and fires.

    He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting
    blood.  Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground,
    bathing in his blood.  You see him going insane, right at
    that moment.  His face is suddenly demonic.

    SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION.  His
    glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace.  He has Engelman's gun
    in one blood-drenched hand.

    Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he
    begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace.  He keeps
    the pistol down along his side.  Spreg exists at the
    center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do.  He
    has a gun so they can't rush him.  But he's a cop, so they
    can't shoot him.  Several officers shout at him to drop
    the weapon.  You barely hear them over the pandemonium of
    the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.

                             LENNY
              SHOOT!

    Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg,
    completely unhinged, lurches toward them.  Engelman's body
    slides over the ground, leaving a snail-track of blood a
    foot wide.

                             SPREG
              YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!

    He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and...

    Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take
    the fire, and...

    POW POW POW!  The LAPD executes Spreg in a hail of fire.
    He drops like a sack of cement.

    The smoke clears.  Lenny blinks... realizing he is alive.

    He faints.  Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot.  He
    opens his eyes.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, what?

    CUT TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.  Mace and Lenny are being
    escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of
    cops who part the rowdy mob before them.

    Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up.  Lenny's
    arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound.  They
    support each other like two soldiers after a battle.

    Mace sees Faith... FAITH, escorted by a couple of cops,
    passing near them.  She is in handcuffs and her eyes are
    dull.  Mace turns back to Lenny...

                             MACE
              Are we under arrest?

                             LENNY
              Naw.  They just have to ask us a
              few questions... for about six
              hours.

    They pass DEATH, with the (plastic) BABY still in his
    arms.  Life out of Death in the endless continuum.  Lenny
    pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past.

    They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance.  The EMT
    guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit
    jacket.  Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad
    car.  Lenny sees...

    The CLOCK MIME, who smiles at him and puts his hands at
    midnight.  We hear a roar passing through the crowd.  A
    huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as
    everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.

                             CROWD
              TEN!  NINE!  EIGHT!...

    Lenny and Mace look around... the wonder of it sinking in.

                             CROWD
              SEVEN!  SIX!  FIVE!...

    Mace and Lenny let it wash over them... the deliverance
    from darkness.

                             CROWD
              FOUR!  THREE!  TWO!  ONE!  HAPPY NEW
              YEAR!

    The exultation of the moment flows through them as the
    people lift their voices in a great cheer.  Balloons are
    released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard.
    Couples grab each other and kiss passionately.

                             MACE
                      (grinning)
              Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  We did.

    She hugs him.  Then pulls back.  Friends... yes.  And
    always.  But there's that line that she can't cross.  Only
    he can do that.

                             MACE
              Well...
                      (she shrugs)
              Get going.  You're still bleeding.

                             LENNY
              See you downtown.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  See you there.

    TRACKING WITH LENNY as he walks toward the ambulance.
    They open the back door for him.  The walk is
    hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the
    hysteria of the crowd.  He looks back at Mace as the
    paramedics help him up into the ambulance.  The back doors
    close.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  A cop gently takes her arm,
    opening the squad car door for her.  She turns away, her
    face sad amid the exultation of the crowd.  She gets into
    the back seat.  The door slams.  Strickland gets in next
    to her.  The driver starts the car.  They start to move,
    and...

    There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and...
    The door is wrenched open...
    A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out...

    Lenny.  His eyes are full of emotion.
    He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like
    there's no tomorrow.  She grabs his head and won't let him
    break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't.

    Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his
    watch.  Reflex.  Because if there's one time you don't
    need a watch, it's...

    12:01  A.M.  JANUARY 1, 2000

    PULL BACK AND UP as Lenny and Mace stay locked together,
    while the cops wait for them, and the world begins again.

                             THE END

               FADE IN:
          1    EXT.   ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING
          
               A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. There
               is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS
               are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight
               glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the
               mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers
               about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a
               perfect day.
          
               A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and
               parks beside the slat and shingled building.
          
               TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.
          
          2    POWER POLE - ANGLE ON TELEPHONE LINEMEN
          
               High on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps
               to work, their bodies forming a "Y." One of them suddenly turns,
               pointing at a nearby treetop.
          
                                              FIRST LINEMAN
                                   Lookee there!
          
               He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and
               hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of
               the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a
               HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his
               marksmanship.
          
          3    CLOSE ANGLE ON BUZZARD - MOVING SHOT
          
               The big, frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky,
               flapping for its life and suddenly...SPLAT! It crashes head-on into
          3A   the bubble of the passing HELICOPTER.
          
          4    INT.   HELICOPTER
          
               The ship rocks as the PILOT wrestles the controls. There are THREE
               OTHERS in the cabin. The man beside the pilot, ELI CROSS, is
               sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple. He glances up in
               irritation.
          
                                              ELI
                                   Hey, will you stop wiggling?!
          
                                                -2-
          
          
          
                                             PILOT
                                  Don't yell at me...yell at the
                                  goddamn crazy bird! It tried to
                                  kill us!
          
                                             ELI
                                     (back to his manuscript)
                                  Oh yeah, that's your story. What's
                                  the bird got to say about it?
          
              Eli bites into his apple, grimacing at the mushy mouthful    He tosses
              it out the hatch.
          
          5   EXT.   FOREST - TREETOPS
          
              The apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch
              and falls on the slanted roof of the ROADSIDE DINER beneath. It
              rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked
              Highway Patrol car.
          
          6   INT.   PATROL CAR
          
                                             FIRST POLICEMAN
                                  Something hit the roof.
          
                                             SECOND POLICEMAN
                                  So will the Chief...if we don't grab
                                  this guy Cameron.
          
              They climb out as we see a SECOND PATROL CAR sliding up behind them.
              MORE POLICEMEN emerge from the second car.
          
          7   EXT.   DINER - ON POLICEMEN
          
              They huddle, then move toward the diner entrance.     As they pass an
              open WINDOW the CAMERA HOLDS.
          
              INT.   DINER
          8
          
              A FRY COOK serves behind the long counter where MEN on stools eat
              watching the overhead TV. There is a PINBALL MACHINE in action.
              The policemen are seen ENTERING b.g. A TRUCK DRIVER ambles up and
              straddles a stool.
          
                                             TRUCK DRIVER
                                  Gettin' hot early. It's gonna be a
                                  scorcher.
          
              The fry cook fills the driver's empty water glass from a pitcher,
              then move down the counter.
          
                                               -3-
          
          
          9    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He sits a few stools away. He's about 25, even-featured, bone-
               weary. His appealing face needs a shave. The cook fills his water
               glass. The ice cubes rattle as Cameron's hand trembles. His eyes
               are riveted on the policemen.
          
          10   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one
               policeman moves to a WALL TELEPHONE, another stands near the CASH
               REGISTER looking at a magazine. They seem nonchalant, but are
               placed to block all avenues of escape.
          
          11   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm.       He whirls to
               face the man beside him.
          
                                             MAN
                                  That's really a beaut...really a
                                  beaut!
          
               The MAN is staring at the TATOO which shows below the rolled-up
               sleeve of Cameron's shirt, a large American Eagle with elaborate
               scrollwork and a patriotic slogan. The man pulls up his own sleeve
               to show a small tatoo of an anchor.
          
                                             MAN (CONT'D)
                                  My wife still yells about this...but
                                  yours -- that's some eagle...like a
                                  billboard.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                      (eyes on police)
                                  Yeah, that's the grand old bird.
                                     (a half-smile)
                                  Right now I just wish the son-of-a-
                                  bitch could fly.
          
               Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine.
          
          12   ANGLE ON PINBALL
          
               The PLAYER wiggles and contorts, using body English to influence the
               balls.
          
                                               -4-
          
          
          
                                           HECKLER
                                Hey Morton, you think your ass is
                                connected to the machine? You
                                wiggle, it's gonna make the ball go
                                where you want?
          
          12A   Cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the TV above the counter. On
                it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as
                NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food. Her ass, too,
          12B   wiggles engagingly. The pinball player leaves the machine.
                Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks
                closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.
          
                                           POLICEMAN
                                Hey, you're lucky. Somebody left a
                                free ball.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Uh huh.
          
                Cameron shoots. The ball bounces crazily inside the machine, lights
                and buzzers flashing. Another policeman approaches.
          
                                           SECOND POLICEMAN
                                You got 20,000! You're gonna win...
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Win what?
          
                                           SECOND POLICEMAN
                                A free game!
          
                                           CAMERON
                                Terrific...
          
                He rests his hands on the machine, glancing about.    Escape seems
                hopeless.
          
                                           CAMERON (CONT'D)
                                ...that's just what I needed...one
                                more chance to lose.
          
                In a lightning-swift motion, the cop clamps his hands down over
                Cameron's wrists, snapping the HANDCUFFS on. The trap has sprung.
          13    CLOSE ON COP AND CAMERON
          
                Cameron nods his head in resignation. A big uncontrollable grin
                breaks and spreads over the cop's face.
          
                                              -5-
          
          
               Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for
               the back door. He flings it open. The cops are moving toward him.
               One has almost got his gun out.
          
                                            POLICEMAN
                                Cameron!   Halt! I'll shoot!
          
               Cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the
               screen door still blocks his path. He tears through it, but gets
               stuck halfway.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (panicked)
                                No!...God, don't shoot!
          
               Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he
               breaks free and runs.
          
          14   EXT.   REAR OF DINER
          
               As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear
               door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his
               back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences,
               between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the
               other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.
          
          15   INT.   FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY
          
               As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not
               alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze
               of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen
               cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.
               He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a
               MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone
               linemen we saw earlier.
          
          16   WIDER ANGLE
          
               The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron.
               The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at
               Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.
               The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same
               gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.
          
                                           LINEMAN
                                Stand right there like a good old
                                boy and do what I say. You wanna
                                try and mess with me, you've had
                                fair warning. I was a combat Marine
                                in Korea. Okay?
          
                                                 -6-
          
          
               The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  Korea? No shit, so was my old
                                  man...
                                     (he suddenly stamps his
                                      foot and shrieks)
                                  Aaaaaaaargh!
          
               The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull,
               he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight
               against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to
               his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down
               like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.
               A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other
               lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one
               step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed
               grasp and dashes off into the forest.
          
          17   MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON
          
               He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the
               bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds
               his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no
               pursuers, the forest is silent.
          
          18   CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS
          
               The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting
               the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the
               cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against
               one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his
               sharp outcry.
          
          19   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               Doubled up, holding his wrist in pain. The bracelet is still
               intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs
               the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above.
          20   EXT.   OLD ABANDONED ROAD - DAY
          
               Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the
               mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its
               low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing
               toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.
          
                                                 -7-
          
          21   CAMERON'S POV
          
               In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from
               the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him.
          
          22   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from
               this hidden vantage.
          
          23   ANGLE ON ROAD
          
               The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible
               now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension
               suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as
               he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat
               wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG
               SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.
          24   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg
               roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly
               there is a screech of brakes.
          
          25   ANGLE ON CAR
          
               The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop.
               Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and
               climbs in beside the DRIVER.
          26   INT.   CAR
          
                                               CAMERON
                                  Thanks.    I thought you didn't see
                                  me.
          
               The driver, BURT, is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and
               deeply agitated. Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he
               talks half to Cameron, half to himself.
          
                                               BURT
                                  Damn it.    Screwed it up.   Lost my
                                  nerve.
          
               Fishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his
               nostril.
          
                                                -8-
          
          
                                           BURT (CONT'D)
                                Goddamn sinuses. Can't even see
                                straight.
          
               Cameron looks at him, puzzled.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                You want me to drive?
          
               Burt whirls on him, enraged.
          
                                           BURT
                                What the hell is that supposed to
                                mean?!
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (confused)
                                No offense...thought you might...
          
                                           BURT
                                Every one of you jerks is a goddamn
                                hotshot expert! Thanks for the vote
                                of confidence. If you think you can
                                do any better, just come and try it!
          
               He puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard.
          
          27   EXT.   CAR
          
               Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the
               Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the
               momentum.
          
               Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows.
               Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes
               screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred-
               eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron.
          28
               INT.   CAR - ANGLE ON BURT
          
               Driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the
               window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond.
          
                                             -9-
          
          29   ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight
               of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes
               over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
               flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the
               direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big
               spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse
               of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.
          
               As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed,
               expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens
               his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is
               gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge
               where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is
               nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles
               swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be
               caused by the current.
          
          30   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               His thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole
               thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye
               level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe.
          
          31   WIDER ANGLE
          
               It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has
               swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing,
               catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be
               seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man
               beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and
               begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a
               field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,
               hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks,
               away from the road.
          
          32   CAMERON - MOVING SHOT
          
               Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE
               TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back,
               THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look,
               from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each
               other. Cameron runs on.

          33    EXT.   BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN
          
                A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround
                a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier,
                boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with
                sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm
                might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION
                CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the
                sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff.
          
          34    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to
                survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches
                down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into
                cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn
                boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the
                town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He
                unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his
                wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet
                against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the
                sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward
                the town.
          35    EXT.   BOARDWALK
          
                The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words: 'HAVE A NICE DAY.'
                THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a
                YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond
                him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with
                the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis.
                The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors,
                whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky,
                perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling.
                Cameron watches it warily as he walks.
          
          35A   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK
          
                A BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier. Many of the
                people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below. Cameron notices the
                helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open
                cockpit BIPLANE. It is a WORLD WAR I FIGHTER with BRITISH INSIGNIA.
          
          35B   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK AND SKY
          
                Cameron works his way through the crowd. All eyes now look upward
                at the plane. A LOUD VOICE is HEARD coming through an electric

                                           VOICE
                                All right, people. Quiet! We're
                                losing the sun! This is a take!
                                You're welcome to watch, but please,
                                no flashbulbs. They'll spoil the
                                shot.
          
               Cameron's world has become more ordered again. It's a film company
               shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg.
               His eyes go to the scene below.
          36   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
               is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms
               unload ashore. The bright little plane has started a lazy dive
               toward the soldiers, its engine whining. From here it looks as
               fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron.
          
          37   ANGLE ON THE BEACH
          
               As the British plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous
               explosion. In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats,
               ammunition and people are blown sky-high. The smoke from the
               exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene.
          38   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               The onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their
               pleasure turns to horror and disbelief.
          39   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               As the smoke lifts, the Tom and Jerry violence has become a
               horrifying reality. Bodies are scattered about. One man has been
               severed in half, drenched in blood. Chunks of meat, arms and legs
               litter the beach.
          40   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               Paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe.
          
                                           MAN
                                   (shouting)
                                Something went wrong.
          
               Then, people begin to moan and scream.
          
                                                 - 12 -
          
          41    CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring tensely at the carnage.      By reflex, a shout escapes his
                lips.
          
                                               CAMERON
                                   Medic!   Get the medics!
          41A   A WOMAN sags into a faint.      A small child in the crowd is crying and
                clutching Cameron's leg.
          
          42    ANGLE ON COVE
          
                As the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn.
          
                                               VOICE (O.S.)
                                   Cut!   I said CUT! That's a print.
          
                Suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd
                farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin
                wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to
                create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human
                beings before our eyes once again.
          
          43    ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                The crowd reacts in various ways. Sighs of relief, laughter, anger.
                The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their
                trouser legs.
          
                                              A.D.
                                      (yelling)
                                   Beautiful, Harvey. You gave
                                   everybody a heart attack.
          
                HARVEY, the Second Unit Director, yells back.
          
                                              HARVEY
                                   Eli will hate it. He said he wanted
                                   the shot in one? Now watch, he'll
                                   do six hours of pick-ups.
          
                The crowd disperses.      A TOURIST turns to Cameron.
          
                                              TOURIST
                                   Great...but why do they always use
                                   so much blood? It ruins the
                                   realism, don't you think?
          
                                              - 13 -
          
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (still shaken, quietly
                                   mutters)
                               ...asshole...
          
               The tourist stiffens as Cameron turns away, his attention now drawn
               by the beating sound of the helicopter. He glances up.
          44   CAMERON'S POV
          
               The helicopter is descending toward the beach while the FILM CREW
               rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a
               landing site.
          
          45   ANGLE ON FISHING PIER
          
               Wary of the men in the chopper, Cameron is moving down the pier away
               from the landing site. Suddenly he stops short, caught by something
               he sees O.S. Excitedly he points and begins to shout.
          
                                            CAMERON
                               Hey!    Hey you...!
          46   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Below him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the
               same red hair, the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man
               in the Duesenberg. Hearing the shout, the actor stops and
               tentatively turns. It's a mistake. Clearly the features are
               different. It's not Burt.
          47   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON
          
               Cameron is puzzled. He watches as the red-haired actor looks about
               to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by
               a LITTLE OLD LADY holding a parasol and offering her autograph book.
          
                                          LITTLE OLD LADY
                               Mr. Bailey! Aren't you Raymond
                               Bailey, the actor? Would you please
                               sign your autograph? Write 'to
                               Emily...for eternal peace.'
          
               Raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man who's done it a
               million times. He has those special rugged good looks that belong
               to Marlboro men and movie stars.

                                          LITTLE OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                               I'm certainly glad you're all right.
                               I lost my husband and my son in the
                               wars...
          
               The sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers
               for a landing. The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads
               for the landing site.
          
          48   ANGLE ON HELICOPTER
          
               As it touches the ground and its doors fly open. Out step the
               CREWMEN and ELI CROSS. The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR rushes up and shouts
               over the hissing blades of the idling chopper.

                               the goddamn camera.

                               No Burt! All gone...caught in the
                               current probably and...they're
                               diving downstream and searching the
                               riverbanks, but...don't say anything
                               to the crew yet...

                               Jesus Christ.
          
                                          ELI
                               Yeah, Jesus Christ.
          
                                          A.D.
                               What do you want to do?

                                           ELI
                                I don't know...call my mother and
                                have her tell me it wasn't my
                                fault...
                                   (desperately)
                                ...What the hell could have
                                happened?
          
               Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly
               rises. The sudden WIND from its blades blows some screening off a
               pile of equipment. It falls on the Little Old Lady who has been
               approaching Eli and topples her into the surf. She is trapped in a
               tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats. Before she can regain her
               balance, a wave tumbles her further into the sea.
          
          49   ANGLE INCLUDING CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sitting on the edge of the pier over the water, has watched
               this mini-disaster. The undertow from the wave has swept the Old
               Lady directly beneath him. Reaching down toward her, he yells:
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Hey!   Hey, give me your hand!
          
               He can't quite reach her. As a last resort, he drops off the edge
               into the water by her side.
          50   ANGLE ON WATER
          
               He grabs for the struggling Old Lady.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                Don't be afraid! You're gonna be
                                okay.
          
               Like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts,
               grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water. She is
               choking, gasping for air. She turns her face toward him.
          
          51   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. She frees
               her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the RUBBER
               MASK on which is the melting putty and make up. With it goes her
               wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl.

          The sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face,
          ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking
          - a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to
          that kind of "movie star" beauty. It's something Cameron feels in
          the pit of his stomach.

          As they are only in a few feet of water, there is no longer any
          reason to hold her. He starts to put her down.

          Grinning, he carries her toward shore.

               ANGLE ON BEACH
          
               Eli, surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists, is standing at
               the water's edge as Cameron wades in and sets Nina down.
          
                                          ELI
                                Nina! You damned near scared me to
                                death!
          
               At the sight of Eli, she becomes like a little girl who, having
               skinned her knee and run to daddy, now can allow herself to cry.
          
                                           NINA
                                Oh hell, it's all ruined now and I
                                wanted you to see the makeup, Eli.
                                Where were you?...I even got
                                Raymond's autograph and he didn't
                                know...You'd have been proud...
          
               Nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels, taking
               pictures, all shouting at once. The CROWD closes in, excluding
               Cameron to the outskirts.
          
                                           ELI
                                   (to the A.D.)
                                Get her into a tub, then bed...and I
                                want to see her in makeup and
                                costume again before dinner.
          
               THREE CREWMEN hustle her off, as she searches the crowd for
               Cameron...then spots him.
          
                                           NINA
                                Hey! Thank you! That was really
                                gallant...rescuing an old lady!
          
               Cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk Nina away.
          
          53   ANGLE ON ELI
          
               He moves toward Cameron.
          
                                           ELI
                                Wait a second!   I want to thank you,
                                too!
          
               As Eli trots up, Cameron tenses, finally facing this man who saw him
               from the helicopter.

                          Don't run away.   What is that, a
                          habit with you?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Yeah, I also smoke too much.
          
                                     ELI
                          You and Burt on the bridge...how
                          about telling me what happened?
          
          Eli begins to stroll along the sand toward the pilings which support
          the pier. Cameron hesitates, but Eli's manner compels him to
          follow.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I don't know. He must've gone
                          crazy. He tried to run me down.
          
                                     ELI
                          Oh?...Why would he do that?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (flustered)
                          ...I didn't ask him why! All I know
                          is he was comin' at me very fast.
                             (quoting an axiom spouted
                              by top sergeants in a

                          'You want to get home for

                          you'...That's one thing I learned
                          from the gooks.

                          ring...
          
          They have reached the pier.   Eli stops, he is watching something
          O.S.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          You guys really used to call them
                          gooks? I thought that was just Time
                          Magazine.

                               That was 'Nam. What should I call
                               'em, WOPS? Nobody'd known what I
                               was talkin' about.
          
               He turns to follow Eli's gaze.
          
          54   CAMERON'S POV - POLICE CAR
          
               A POLICE CAR has driven onto the beach. From it, THREE OFFICERS
               have emerged. They are armed and efficient looking. The PRODUCTION
               MANAGER moves to greet them. Eli takes Cameron's wrist and gently
               pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings, (privately reacting
               to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt). JAKE, the Chief, is
               irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance.
          
                                          JAKE
                               All right, this time you've had it!
                               Where is he?!
          
                                          PRODUCTION MANAGER
                               Chief, I'm glad you dropped by. Eli
                               says you gotta do something about
                               all these people on the beach.
          
                                          JAKE
                                  (bellowing)
                               Thirty minutes is what you've got to
                               get your goddamn equipment off this
                               beach and out of town!...You tell
                               Eli Cross if your men are on the
                               streets after four o'clock, I'll
                               throw their ass in jail!
          55   ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON
          
               Eli squats down on his heels and leans back against a piling,
               smiling up at Cameron.
          
                                          ELI
                               Speaking of jail...would you get
                               upset if I asked how many cops were
                               after you?

                          Your I.D. bracelet...the look on
                          your face...the way you ran from the
                          bridge...
                             (with exaggerated delicacy)
                          I...don't suppose you want to tell
                          me what you did.
          
          Cameron studies Eli, not knowing what to make of him.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          No...I don't.
          
                                     ELI
                             (brightly, with humor)
                          ...Could I try categories?
          
          Cameron half laughs despite himself.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)

                          Ever done any stunt work?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          What?
          
                                     ELI
                          How'd you like to be a stunt man?
                          You look like you're in pretty good
                          shape, fast on your feet. You could
                          do it.

                          choice.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
          Jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the
          Production Manager. Eli puts his hand on Cameron's shoulder and
          steps out into the sunlight.
          
                                     ELI
                             (softly, to Cameron)
                          Now, don't get hasty. And, remember
                          your ass, it's just like mine...
                          maybe I can save them both.

                          ...but we've gotta have three days
                          to finish this picture...

                             (striding toward Eli)
                          You said you'd be gone four days
                          ago, before the season started. You
                          lie, break promises...
                             (he is now close enough
                              and shouting at Eli)
                          Cross, I've gone out of my way, but
                          this time...
          
          A TRAM beeps, clangs and passes between them, interrupting Jake and
          leaving him sputtering. As it departs, Eli seizes the moment.
          
                                     ELI
                          Jake, it's been a rotten morning.
                          You're hot and tired. Let's go in,
                          have us a drink and find out what's
                          eating you.
          
                                     JAKE
                             (turning beet red)
                          Don't treat me like these other
                          morons! You know goddamn well
                          what's eating me is that Duesenberg
                          on the bottom of the river with the
                          dead man in it!
          
          There is silence. Eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his
          toe. Then Jake starts shouting again.
          
                                     JAKE (CONT'D)
                          I mean, that is a goddamn public
                          bridge and a public river! You go
                          there without permits, without any
                          precautions and get a man killed!

                          Go ahead, ask him, Jake.
          
          Eli's words are exploding in Cameron's mind -- that illusory event
          on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality.

                          Why not, Burt?! Because you're a
                          fake?! Because you're just a
                          goddamn daredevil with a head full
                          of marbles?!
          
          Cameron vaguely understands that Eli is trying to pass him off as
          Burt and that he, somehow, may be saved by going along with this
          madness. Eli, turning to Jake, continues passionately...
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          He grabs the bread, blows the shot,
                          screws you up...screws me up. He's
                          dumb, Jake, but thank God, he ain't
                          dead yet. So do me a favor, put
                          your handcuffs on this son-of-a-
                          bitch and put him some place where
                          he can't get hurt!
          
          The Chief is dazed. If this is Burt, the stunt man, he is obviously
          alive. Jake goes to Cameron.
          
                                     JAKE
                          How did you get out of the car?
          
                                     ELI
                          He didn't get out. Our divers got
                          him out...and brought him back in
                          the chopper.
          
          The Chief stares at Cameron. His clothes and hair are wet. There
          is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the
          Duesenberg. He looks the part. Jake turns to Eli with resignation.
          
                                    JAKE

                          Cross, when these three days are up,
                          I'm going to arm my men with
                          shotguns and tell them it's open
                          season on any fruit carrying a
                          camera.
          
          He walks to the waiting police car, surrounded by TOURISTS snapping
          pictures. He glares at them, angry at the world. Eli puts his arm
          on Cameron's shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd
          toward the hotel. Eli is now easygoing and friendly.
          
                                     ELI
                          You did that very well.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I didn't get a chance to say a word.
                          I just listened.
          
                                     ELI
                          There are only a few actors in the
                          world who have mastered that art.
                          Anyway, it was a good audition. You
                          landed the part.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          How? What about the crew? They
                          going to look at me and say, 'Hi,
                          Burt?'
          
                                     ELI
                          Unless you prefer, 'Hi, Elizabeth.'
                          Don't worry about my crew, they'll
                          call you anything I want 'em to.
                          Look, I'm not being callous. Burt
                          is a fucking tragedy, but there's
                          nothing in the world I can do about
                          it...I've gotta have this location
                          for three more days...and you need a
                          place to hide.
          
          They have reached the steps of the HOTEL. A BUS has stopped in
          front. TOURISTS are piling out. The POLICE CAR pulls up and parks
          nearby. Jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd.
          
                                     A.D.
                             (shouting in b.g.)
                          Eli! The crew's waiting.   We need
                          the next setup!

          Eli turns back to Cameron as they mount the steps.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          By tomorrow the local cops'll know
                          what I look like. I can't hang
                          around.
          
                                     ELI
                             (expansively)
                          "Burt," stop worrying! Haven't you
                          heard of "movie magic?"
                             (pointing to the etched
                              glass doors of the hotel)
                          That door is "the looking glass,"
                          and inside...is Wonderland. You're
                          gonna pose as a stunt man, who's
                          posing as an actor, who's posing as
                          a character in a movie...who's
                          posing as an enemy soldier...In that
                          big a crowd, who's gonna notice you?
                          People like to believe in things and
                          cops are just people.
          
          The have reached the front door.   Eli holds it open for Cameron.

                             (with mock confidentiality)
                          Frankly, your problem's so simple,
                          it's almost beneath me. Have faith,
                          'Alice.' Close your eyes and enjoy.
          
          In exhaustion and resignation, Cameron nods and wearily closes his
          eyes.

                His eyes open. He stares at his face in the mirror, pleased at the
                subtle transformation. His hair has been cut shorter and dyed red,
                somehow changing his whole aspect. He rubs the red mark on his
                wrists where the bracelet has been removed.
          
          56A   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Part of the laundry room is being used for the film's Hairdressing
                Department. Cameron sits in a barber chair wearing a plastic apron,
                surrounded by dryers, wigs, etc. In b.g., washing machines churn
                constantly. DENISE, the Hairdresser, an attractive earthy woman of
                thirty-two, stands over him. He is still wary and trying not to
                show it.

                                    (looking in mirror)
                                 ...Could be worse...could be
                                 green...I think I like it.
          
                                            DENISE
                                 Of course you like it...ask
                                 anybody... Denise gives great hair.
                                 Got any grass?

                                 Nope.
          
                She touches his hair to test the dryness, holding her hand there for
                a moment longer than seems necessary. He grins at her, rises and
                crosses to the wall mirror to get a better look.
          
                                            DENISE
                                 What else don't you have that I
                                 need?
          
                She moves to a basement window and gazes out.

                Through the window, the crew is setting up a shot while Eli
                rehearses with Nina and his red-haired male star, RAYMOND BAILEY,
                (who Cameron earlier saw on the beach). Bailey is dressed as a
                World War I British aviator and Nina as a young girl of that era.

                          You're too good looking. His idea
                          of a perfect stunt double is two-
                          hundreds pounds of hamburger in a
                          red wig...
          
          He studies the view, his attention focused on Nina.

                              interest in Nina)
                          At selling douche powder, she's
                          fabulous; dog food?...I'm not sure
                          she's sincere.

                          What are you sore about?
          
                                     DENISE
                          I'm not sore. Isn't that what you
                          wanted to know?
                             (with sarcasm)
                          ...Or did you mean, what's the real
                          Nina Franklin like--without the
                          greasepaint and tinsel...
          
          Moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor, she pokes around
          with the toe of her shoe.

                          underneath?
          
          Snaring a crumpled garment, she kicks it toward Cameron, who catches
          it instinctively, then holds it up for inspection -- a pair of
          (Nina's) lace panties. He grins, mildly embarrassed by the charade.

                                   Sensitive?
          
               She reaches for the panties, but instead takes his hand and yanks
               sharply, pulling him off balance, falling back on the laundry pile
               with Cameron on top of her, their faces inches apart; surprise on
               his, amusement on hers.

               Cameron is trying to remember: what was it Eli said? "Close your
               eyes, relax and enjoy." Across the room the washing machines churn,
               whirl and heave.
          
          59   EXT.   BEACH AREA
          
               Eli and his crew are shooting a scene: a "pick-up" shot for the
               explosion sequence we saw earlier. Eli and GABE, the cameraman, are
               lying beside the camera. Before them, the "severed" arm protrudes
               from the sand in which its owner is buried, out of sight.

                                       beneath the sand)
                                   Where's Raymond?
                                      (Raymond kneels beside
                                       him)
                                   Remember, you just crashed...you
                                   were wandering the beach behind the
                                   German lines looking for a place to
                                   hide when you saw the explosion.
                                   You're stunned by the carnage. That
                                   bomb was dropped by a guy in your
                                   squadron. Okay? Roll the film.
          60   POV THRU CAMERA
          
               Through the CAMERA, WE SEE the 'arm' protruding from the sand. We
               HEAR o.s. VOICES yelling: "Turning"... "speed"... "action." We see
               the fingers begin to move spasmodically. Eli's voice yells: "Okay,
               Raymond!"
          
               Suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell, bigger and
               bigger...like a rubber glove filling with air...then BANG! BANG!
               BANG! The (balloon-covered) fingers EXPLODE.

          61   ANGLE ON BEACH
          
               Everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank, including Eli.
               Gabe is patting Eli's face, Raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately
               as one would a pet dog's.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (cackling)
                                Gotcha that time! Didn't we?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (through his laughter)
                                Yeah, you got me another half-hour
                                behind.
          
               Eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides. Cameron, now
               wearing a uniform exactly like Raymond's, watches from the
               sidelines.
          
                                           RAYMOND

                                Thought the chief could use a little
                                cheering up today.

                                    serious)
                                ...So you heard the news about
                                Burt...
          
                                           RAYMOND

                                Any more word?

                                Afraid not...there's no picture ever
                                made that's worth it.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (shaking his head)
                                I'll never understand why these guys
                                do it -- take the chances.

                                Don't know. Trying to beat the
                                system, I guess...we all know that
                                some day we're gonna die of nothing
                                more important than wrinkles...and
                                that makes us so scared and crazy,
                                we'll do anything. Go off
                                bridges...fight windmills...wars...
                                anything.
          
               There is great sadness among them.     Eli breaks the mood lightly.
          
                                           ELI (CONT'D)
                                That's what our film's about -- or
                                didn't you know?
                                   (sees Cameron)
                                Hey, Burt, come over here.
          
               Cameron crosses to them. He and Raymond stand appraising each
               other, red-haired men in identical uniforms. As Raymond offers his
               hand:
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (to Eli)
                                My new cock and balls?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (quickly)
                                Not new...It's important not to let
                                that get around as yet. So, for the
                                time being, let's make like he's the
                                same guy.
                                   (adding a touch of color)
                                But no longer known as "Bad-assed
                                Burt." Ever since his 'fortunate
                                rescue,'...we call him "Lucky."
          
          62   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ANGLE ON CHUCK - LATER THAT DAY
          
               CHUCK BARTON is a tall, rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties, the
               Stunt Gaffer on Eli's film. A MESSENGER trots up and presents a
               receipt book. Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently.
          
                                           MESSENGER
                                Your film from that camera in the
                                Duesenberg's on the way to the lab.
                                Put it on the plane with my own
                                little hands.
          
                                          CHUCK

                          When do we get it back?
          
                                     MESSENGER
                          Don't know. Stamped it "rush."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          If I stamp "rush" on my mare's ass,
                          she'll still take eleven months to
                          foal. Call the lab and find out
                          when!
                             (quietly)
                          I lost a man today. I wanna see
                          that footage and find out why.
          
          As the Messenger leaves, Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands
          waiting, circles around him, sizing him up. Cameron is no longer
          wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Done any stunt work?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Not really.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Not really?   You have or you
                          haven't?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (good-naturedly)
                          I got out of Vietnam in one piece.
                          Let me tell you that wasn't a bad
                          stunt.
          
                                     CHUCK
                             (skeptically)
                          That's ancient history.

                             (pointing at church
                              steeple)
                          Could you jump from that tower to
                          the that roof?
          
                                              - 31 -
          
          63   ANGLE ON CAMERON (AND STEEPLE)
          
               Gauging the fifteen-foot gap between the CHURCH STEEPLE and the roof
               of the nearby MUNICIPAL BUILDING. He unconsciously grimaces at the
               four-story drop between them.
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (being glib)
                               Once, to save my ass, I jumped out
                               of a banana tree into an oxcart full
                               of buffalo shit. Does that count?
          
                                            CHUCK
                               We'll see.    Put these on.
          
               He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins
               marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in
               the churchyard.
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (puzzled by the pads)
                               Where do they go?
          
                                          CHUCK
                                  (tapping his knee)
                               Under the pants.
                                  (pointing to lines he has
                                   drawn)
                               I want you to jump from here...to
                               there.
          
               Cameron hops up to the starting line, finishing with the knee pads
               clumsily, surveys the distance of not more than seven feet.
          
                                          CAMERON

               Makes a casual jump, landing on the line and looking at Chuck for
               approval.
          
                                          CHUCK
                               Very good. Except you're dead!!
                               Your brains are scattered all over
                               the goddamn pavement. You landed on
                               the edge and fell backwards four
                               stories. Where do we send the body?

                             (returns to the starting
                              line)
                          Don't bury me yet.
          
          He takes a running start and leaps hard.    While he's still in mid-
          air, Chuck yells.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          You're still dead! You fell over
                          the other side of the building.
          
          Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit
          shaken.
          
                                     CHUCK (CONT'D)
                          You wanna try it right, once? You
                          should land in a tuck-and-roll.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Show me, sergeant.
          
          Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just
          beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder
          roll, he somersaults to his feet.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Very fancy.
          
          He takes a running start and does the same.   Not quite as well, but
          well enough. As he rolls to his feet:
          
                                    CAMERON
                          Okay?
          
                                    CHUCK
                          Better.

                          My speciality is Hopscotch.
          
          Chuck turns on him enraged, overreacting.

                                You know one goddamn daredevil on
                                this picture was enough! What the
                                hell was Eli thinking, giving me a
                                smart-ass, cocky, amateur kid when I
                                need a stunt man! It's a little
                                different running across that roof
                                when they're pumping tracer bullets
                                over your head.

                                I was running for twenty-six months
                                with guys shooting at me...not over
                                my head...at my head and I'm alive.
                                I knew daredevils. I got nothing
                                against them...it's just they're all
                                dead. So ease off and give me a
                                chance...

               Chuck starts to walk away, then stops and looks at Cameron.

                                Can you imaging Eli doing a World
                                War I picture without horses? Do
                                you know the gags I could do with
                                four runaway horses pulling a

               Cameron sailing into the SHOT. Chuck ducks slightly, catching
               Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault. Cameron
               lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building.
               Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak. The church steeple can
               be seen in b.g. (and we now realize time has passed and we are no
               longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence, but atop the
               building).

                                What's Eli got against horses?    I
                                love horses.

                Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his
                shoulder. Sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see Chuck
                strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat. Cameron
                scrambles to follow.
          
                                           CHUCK

                                We'll draw a sight line for you to
                                follow down the roof here, while
                                you're rolling. Now there's nothing
                                very difficult. But this is where
                                you gotta think. Your mind can't be
                                on snatch. It's gotta be on
                                grabbing that gutter.
          
                They have reached the lower edge of the roof.    Cameron looks down at
                the drop.

                Chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the
                crew is setting up a shot in a room below.

               They move to another edge of the roof overlooking a NARROW CENTRAL
               COURTYARD. They gaze down at a WINDOW AWNING two stories below that
               juts from the side of the building-wing across the court.

                                and hit that awning. Then Eli yells
                                "cut" and old Raymond takes your
                                place for the close-ups and the
                                glory. That's where the German
                                soldiers catch him and throw him in
                                the nuthouse. They're shootin' that

               Cameron's face is beginning to sweat and the veins are bulging from
               the growing strain of some physical effort.

               gutter, four stories above the ground.

               In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal
               building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in
               a World War I military asylum. In it, Eli's crew is filming a
               sequence -- a dozen enraged INMATES in tatters, heads shaven, wild-
               eyed, advance toward Raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of
               Cameron's exultant yell).

               Raymond, dressed as a British Flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and
               retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated
               derelicts suddenly swarm over him. One, like a mad dog, goes fro
               his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club.
               Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams.

               For an instant, the inmates stop in stunned silence -- broken only
               by a distant shout overhead.

                          anyway.
          
          As Eli steps down from the DOLLY, a solemn, quiet man approaches him
          from among the onlookers. It is SAM BAUM (the writer).

                                Well, who was that on the phone in
                                the middle of the night when you
                                first read it, raving about the
                                magical madhouse scene, the upstairs
                                maid?
          
               Eli rips the page with the "madhouse scene" from his screenplay as
               they stride out of the building.
          
          69   EXT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING
          
               There, beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand, sits
               Eli, cross-legged, staring morosely at some kids who play nearby.
               He is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane.
               Behind him, at a respectful distance, stand the Production Manager,
               A.D., half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and Sam Baum, all looking
               concerned. Sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches Eli,
               squatting beside him on the sand pile.
          
                                           SAM
                                What do you wanna do, Eli?...
                                They're all waiting.
          
               While Sam talks, Eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in Sam's
               shoe. Suddenly noticing, Sam yanks his foot away.
          
                                           SAM (CONT'D)
                                   (irritated)
                                Being childish isn't going to help
                                your movie...You know, there's
                                nothing wrong with the story.
                                   (removing his shoe and
                                    shaking the sand out)
                                The real problem is since I wrote
                                this thing two years ago, you've had
                                Watergate, the energy crisis,
                                Women's Lib, the economy is down the
                                tubes...You want to talk about
                                burning issues?...There's arsenic in
                                the glue on the back of food stamps!
                                That's why you don't like the
                                "madhouse scene." Your goddamn war
                                story has lost its relevance.
          
                                           ELI
                                Don't be negative, Sam. We can
                                start a new one in time for the
                                preview.
          
                                             - 39 -
          
          
               Sam has finished replacing his shoe and Eli pours a fistful of sand
               into Sam's other shoe.
          
                                           SAM
                                Cut it out, will ya?
          
          70   INT.   HOTEL DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
          
               Eli is at the head of a long table, CAMERA PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a
               dozen members of the company dining with him. Nina sits beside Eli
               listening with rapt attention to Sam's monologue, her dessert fork
               sensuously lingers at her lip.
          
                                           SAM
                                Two years ago you were all charged
                                up to make a great big anti-war
                                statement and they wouldn't let you.
                                Now they let you, but you haven't
                                got a war. What you've got is egg
                                on your face because Vietnam's long
                                gone and it's too late!
          
                                           ELI
                                Our picture's not about fighting
                                wars...
          
                                          SAM
                                Oh?
          
                                           ELI
                                ...It's about fighting windmills.
          
               The truth in Eli's statement registers on Sam. Cameron sits farther
               down the table, watching Nina watch Eli...and wishing she were
               watching him.
          
                                           ELI
                                War isn't the disease...It's only
                                one of the symptoms.
          
                                           SAM
                                   (hooked)
                                What's the disease?
          
                                       - 40 -
          
          
                                     ELI
                          That's the big question, Sam. Name
                          the disease and you've licked the
                          screenplay.
                             (indicating Cameron)
                          Ask him. 'Cause he knows what the
                          film is about. Right Lucky? Tell
                          'em...How'd you like Vietnam?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          How'd you like bubonic plague?
          
                                     ELI
                          You drafted?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          No.
          
                                     ELI
                          See, Sam? Here's another one who
                          hates war...but he enlisted.
                              (to Cameron)
                          You fought in Vietnam for two years?
                          ...I mean actually were out there
                          killing people...
          
                                     CAMERON
                          ...Hey, I didn't kill that many
                          people...
          
                                     ELI
                          Don't be modest, Lucky. Everybody
                          digs a little violence...What was
                          that you said on the beach?
          
          Cameron is starting to bristle at Eli's needling, particularly with
          Nina watching.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          About what?
          
                                     ELI
                          About getting home for Thanksgiving?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (tentatively)
                          ...that you better figure the guy
                          coming at you is trying to kill
                          you...?
          
                                    ELI
          
                                         - 41 -
          
          
                            Yeah. See, Sam?...That's what the
                            disease is about...being scared
                            shitless. Inventing enemies.
                            Whistling in the dark. I wish you'd
                            talk to the kid, Sam, I mean it.
                            You know, really, you guys should
                            room together.
          
                                       SAM
                               (getting the last word)
                            Hey, Lucky, give me your cot by the
                            window and I'll let you read a great
                            madhouse sequence.
          
          They all laugh.
          
                                       SAM
                               (surrendering)
                            All right, Eli. I'll write you
                            another scene. What difference does
                            it make? The studio will cut it all
                            out anyway and what you got left is
                            a lot of swell battle scenes, which,
                            when I was back there they said were
                            "just terrific."
          
                                       ELI
                               (simply)
                            No, they won't.
          
                                       SAM
                            Yeah, what makes you different?
          
                                       ELI
                               (quietly)
                            Because they know if they cut my
                            picture, I'll kill 'em.
          
          The deadly in Eli's voice was more than intended and there is
          suddenly an awkward silence at the table. Cameron eyes Eli with a
          wry smile.
          
                                       CAMERON
                            You mean, bang? Kill 'em, just like
                            that?
          
                                          - 42 -
          
          
                                        ELI
                                (matter of fact)
                             No. I'll kill 'em and eat 'em...I
                             hate to waste anything.
          
                                        SAM
                                (laughs)
                             They call him "Eli the Terrible..."
          
                                        ELI
                             Sam, my picture is the only kid I've
                             got! If the studio said your
                             daughter, Jennifer, would look
                             better with her fingers chopped off,
                             what would you do?
          
                                        SAM
                             Being an insecure writer, I'd call
                             my agent...and get another opinion.
          
          Everyone laughs.
          
          Jake, the Chief of Police, is seen in the background approaching the
          table. Cameron spots him and starts to rise.
          
                                        CAMERON
                             ...If you'll excuse me...
          
                                        JAKE
                                (arriving)
                             Don't go away, Burt.   I want you.

                             Jake! Long time, no see. You taken
                             care of my problem with the beach?
          
                                        JAKE
                             I'm not talking to you.
                                (to Production Manager)
                             I understand you got that film out
                             of the Duesenberg...
          
                                        ELI
                                (cutting in)
                             It's at the lab, Jake.
          
                                            - 43 -
          
          
                                          JAKE
                               I'm talking to this gentleman.
                                  (to Production Manager)
                               We want to see it.
          
               Cameron, realizing the film might disclose his presence on the
               bridge, reacts with alarm, which increases as Eli says...

               A wire photo, front and side views of Cameron, taken at his military

               They mince off (the fag act all the more amusing because of
               Raymond's strictly masculine looks). Eli shouts after them.

               Raymond "gathers" Nina along the way, wrapping his arm about her
               shoulders -- Cameron watching silently. Then, charging from across
               the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake, comes a
               gushing, overwrought, blue-rinsed MATRON.

          73   INT.   CAMERON'S HOTEL ROOM - CLOSE ON DRESSER - NIGHT
          
               Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his
               few belongings into his pockets.
          
               WIDER ANGLE
          
               It's a mean little bedroom, with Sam's clothes, typewriter, etc., in
               evidence. Seeing Sam's wallet, Cameron pulls a wad of money from
               it, at the same time accidentally knocking Sam's false teeth off the
               dresser. He hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty.
               He strides to Sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them
               in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to Sam and starts out the door.
               Then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false
               teeth, which he finally finds. Now, annoyed at himself for being a
               "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly
               exits.

          74    EXT.   HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
                As Cameron moves down the steps, the returning company STATION WAGON
                pulls to a stop in the driveway. Nina, Raymond and a few others
                emerge from the car. Cameron turns away so as not to be seen as
                they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance.
          
                                              DENISE
                                   Bet they're looking for that nut who
                                   killed all those campers in Montana...

                                   ...Imagine, sitting an hour at a

                                   have been an hour.
          74A   They've entered the hotel. Cameron continues to the bottom of the
                stairs, hesitates, looking back at Nina.
          75    CAMERON'S POV
          
                Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of
                "The Looking Glass") he sees the lithe, gay, exquisitely beautiful
                figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about
                her face -- a hauntingly romantic image.
          76    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                He watches for a moment with hopeless longing. Finally, turning
                from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk.
                There come some of Eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch
                through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby
                spot to light a night shot. There's the CHURCH TOWER. He stares at
                it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen
                if...
          
                                              NINA'S VOICE
                                   What next? Do you rescue the maiden
                                   from the tower?
          
                She has come up behind him, unnoticed.    He turns, startled, and
                there she stands.

                          Hi.
          
          For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions.   Then
          she glances at the tower.
          
                                     NINA
                          Yes. It does look pretty high.
                             (with concern)
                          Are you worried about tomorrow?
          
          Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she
          would know him instantly. But his answer is simple and sounds
          sincere.

                          Not much. I guess if there were any
                          real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do
                          it, would he?
          
                                    NINA
                             (quickly, reassuring)
                          No. I'm sure it's safe.

                              grin)
                          Good. Then you jump.

                          Okay.
          
          She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in
          Eli. Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Well, come on.

                          What, right now?
          
          For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. Then acts on
          his decision. Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her
          toward the tower. She holds back, struggling playfully.

          77   INT.   BELL TOWER - NIGHT
          
               It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded
               them. The city lights are seen beyond. Below are the sheds where
               crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. Just beyond is the
               overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE. Nina and Cameron reach
               the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the
               railing and lean over. Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine
               fright.

               She whirls to go.   He stops her, taking her by the shoulders.

               child for running in the street.

               softens with a look of slight surprise.

               It's true. She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear. He
               slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. And then
               they are devouring each other. Abruptly, they're illuminated by a
               fierce blast of white light. They separate and stare, blinking in
               shock and confusion.

               Gabe smiles, scurries off. Eli glances at the tower, grins, having
               toyed with them long enough, he yells.

          Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then
          disappears around the corner of the building. He is left holding
          the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket. It has now
          dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron.

                He pulls Cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that
                Cameron drops Sam's bag. Eli picks it up and plops it into
                Cameron's lap. Suddenly Cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a
                stomach-churning rate -- while Eli rattles on...probing, disarming,

                              the mood broken)
                          ...Besides, I've fallen madly in

          82   EXT.   CHURCH TOWER - NEXT MORNING - BRIGHT DAYLIGHT
          
               The thunderous clang of bells! Cameron ready, coiled tight, heart
               pounding as loud as the bells. A burst of machine gun bullets tears
               through the railing beside him, sending splinters flying against his
               face.

               HARVEY (Second Unit Director) and CAMERA OPERATOR behind the

          84   IN BELL TOWER
          
               Near Cameron, the SECOND A.D., crouched out of sight with a walkie-
               talkie, stabs a finger at him.
          
                                            SECOND A.D.
                                Go!...Go!
          
               A burst of tracer bullets streak past Cameron. Sparks fly, as stray
               bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells.
          85   MACHINE GUN
          
               A 50-calibre MACHINE GUN, a SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN in Levi's and sport
               shirt, pumping tracers past the bell tower.
          86   TWO SHOT - BELL TOWER
          
               The Second A.D. slams his hand down on a PLUNGER, setting off a
               series of explosive squibs. Like machine gun bullets, they start
               shattering the railing, moving toward Cameron, forcing him to the
               edge of the tower.
          
               Vaulting over the rail, he clings to the side of the bell tower.
               Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand. He shoves
               out, launching himself into space. Twisting, hurtling across the
               gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof,
               crawling and scrambling for a hand hold. The relentless tracer
               bullets chip the slate beside him. Crouching low, Cameron, like an
               animal, moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower.
               Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the
               tower.
          
                                             - 55 -
          
          
               Moving around the tower, suddenly there are TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS
               running at him with bayoneted rifles. He wheels and there stands
               ANOTHER GERMAN (Chuck), who leaps toward him, slamming down his
               rifle butt. The blow glances off Cameron. They grapple, kicking,
               clawing, rolling down the steep slope, picking up momentum.
          87   RAIN GUTTER
          
               The roof's edge rushes toward them, below it a fearsome drop.
               Cameron's hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as
               Chuck, screaming, hurtles off the edge, writhing as his body tumbles
               in space toward the ground.
          88   CAMERON
          
               Sweat pouring from his face, a gash on his cheek gushes blood, his
               eyes glazed, he pulls himself back on the roof.
          89
               CATCHER
          
               Chuck, lying relaxed on the straw and mattress safety pad which
               caught him on the ground, looks up, cups his hands and shouts at
               Cameron.
          
                                           CHUCK
                               Go!...Go!
          
          90   ROOF
          
               Cameron, running for his life along the edge of the roof, the
               soldiers shooting down at him from the roof's peak. He reaches the
               far end, looks down. There is the awning jutting from an adjacent
               wall two stories below. He scrambles off the roof. Clinging to the
               down spout, he starts descending it.
          91   SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN
          
               Looking up from the ground, he yanks a control rope.
          
          92   CAMERON
          
               The bracket holding the down spout breaks loose. The spout starts
               to fall away from the side of the building. Cameron clings to it,
               riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree.
          
                                               - 56 -
          
          93   AWNING
          
               At the end of the arc, Cameron throws himself free for a safe
               landing and smashes against the awning. Instead of holding, it rips
               apart like paper and, in that unexpected instant, Cameron's eyes
               widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas
               toward a skylight one floor below.
          94   SKYLIGHT
          
               Exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by Cameron's
               body. He hurtles downward toward a blur of images.
          95   ANGLE ON COT
          
               Collapsing from the impact of Cameron's fall. The MAN and WOMAN who
               were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll
               entwined with him. Cameron is dazed. Like a drowning man, he rages
               to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh.
               A painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is
               in is thrown open, revealing:
          
          96   BROTHEL SET ­ INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING
          
               Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War
               I German army brothel. In the high-ceilinged room, there is a row
               of cots separated by makeshift screens. COUPLES jump up from the
               cots startled. A line of partly naked GERMAN SOLDIERS waiting their
               turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Cameron's
               unorthodox entrance. They crowd around the cubicle where Cameron
               fell and now struggles with the couple.

                          Wait your turn like the rest!
          
          Cameron's confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and
          struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes
          away, passing him back toward the rear of the line.
          
                                     THIRD MAN

                          This is a whorehouse, not a stable.
          
          Whores have left their cots to join in the assault, screeching in
          glee. As he maniacally lashes out at his good-natured molesters,
          the blood from Cameron's face smears a whore's body.
          
                                    ELI'S VOICE
                          Cut!
          
          Instantly everything stops. Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his
          knees at the end of the line. Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has
          caused this humiliation. Then the CLAPPING begins, the CAST and
          CREW applauding his stunt. People slap him on the back admiringly.
          A robe is thrown around him. He is helped to his feet. Suddenly
          Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the
          mouth.
          
                                     NINA
                          I'm so proud of you...I could just
                          die!
          
          He is pulled away from her by the backslappers. Now Cameron is
          responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public
          acclaim. He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't
          noticed. Chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on
          Cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake
          blood inside; the "wound" is gone. He starts feeling Cameron's
          shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage.

                              wincing in pain)
                          Why didn't you tell me about the
                          awning? I could have been killed.

                               the sugarglass skylight. Those
                               stunt men you fell on would have got
                               you out of anything.

                                in his whole life. So, why is it,
                                Eli, that this vulgar little scene
                                turns out to be so much...stronger,
                                more moving?
          
                                               - 60 -
          
          
                                             ELI
                                     (touched)
                                  God knows, Sam. Maybe...because you
                                  get the feeling that the enemy might
                                  just be some poor horny slob like
                                  you, lookin' for the nearest
                                  whorehouse.
                                     (putting his arm around
                                      Cameron)
                                  How about that, Lucky? When that
                                  stunt man's boob hit you in the
                                  mouth, was it just another boob...or
                                  did it taste like kraut?
          
                 The crew laughs and so does Nina.    Cameron feels humiliated by Eli's
                 patronizing tone.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  It tasted lousy. But what do I
                                  know? You try it, Eli. You're the
                                  expert in bad taste.
          
                                             ELI
                                     (for the group)
                                  Uh-oh, sounds like the soldier's got
                                  his feelings hurt.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                  Naw, naw. I just don't know about
                                  Germans. Where I was we only raped
                                  gooks.
          
          100    INT.   HOTEL GARAGE - CLOSE ON ELI
          
                 As though continuing previous dialogue.
          
                                             ELI

                                  you? ...After all this time?

          100A   WIDER ANGLE
          
                 Revealing Eli and Cameron walking through the hotel GARAGE toward a
                 replica of the lost Duesenberg which a MECHANIC works on.
          
                                            ELI

                                  ...Really? Rape? No. I think
                                  you're putting me on. Come on, now,
                                  no more hints.
                                     (he thinks)
                                  Let's see...Christ, could be
                                  anything. I know a guy in this
                                  state got 20 years for having
                                  cunnilingus with his wife.
                                     (studies Cameron)
                                  No...I guess you're not the type.
                                  More likely some hideous crime of
                                  violence...
          
                 Eli is getting under Cameron's skin.     They stop at car.
          
                                             ELI
                                     (to mechanic)
                                  Have you seen Harvey?
          
                                             MECHANIC
                                  I think he's in there.
          
                 Mechanic nods toward a door at the rear of the garage. Eli pats the
                 fender of the Duesenberg. Cameron views it with a strange sense of
                 unease. Putting his arm around Cameron's shoulder, Eli leads him
                 toward the back door yelling to mechanic.
          
                                             ELI
                                  You'll have it ready on time?
          
                                             MECHANIC
                                  Yeah, but don't look under the hood
                                  or you'll find a Chevy.
          
          100B   At the door, Eli can barely open it to squeeze through.
          
          101    INT.   STORAGE ROOM
          
                 An incredible number of people have wedged themselves into this tiny
                 smoke-filled room, peering over each other's heads toward a lighted
                 area at the far end.
          
                                             ELI
                                     (shouting)
                                  Harvey in here?

                                           OFFSTAGE VOICE
                                   (yelling)
                                Quiet. We're shooting.
                                   (then back to business)
                                Come on...let me have a little more
                                face...a little more face!
          
                Eli squats on his haunches peering between the legs of the onlookers
                and tugs on Cameron's sleeve to join him.
          
          102   POV
          
                Hazily, through the restless shifting limbs, male and female, like
                the first rays of morning sun breaking through to the depths of the
                forest, we glimpse Raymond and Gabe shooting their eight millimeter
                epic: Two people screwing in a rowboat. Raymond suddenly throws
                his hands up in despair.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (screaming)
                                Cut!

                                Jesus, Kenneth. Great control. All
                                right, who's doubling for Kenny on
                                the inserts?
          
          103   ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON
          
                Cameron and Eli rise to their feet.
          
                                           ELI
                                Can you believe this? They spend
                                the whole day working in a
                                whorehouse and look how they relax?
                                That's dedication. You think sex
                                can save the world?
                                   (grins at Cameron)
          
                                           CAMERON
                                That's not my bag, Eli.
          
                                           ELI
                                Sex, or saving the world?
          
                                           CAMERON
                                ...The world, that's your special
                                job. And Jesus, are we all lucky to
                                have you around...
          
                Suddenly Cameron is shoved backwards by the door as someone pushes
                against it to get in.
          
                                              - 63 -
          
          
          104   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It is Harvey standing in the doorway with Nina.
          
                                            HARVEY
                                    (to Eli)
                                 Hey Chief, ya lookin' for me?
          
                Nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd, pushing into the
                room. Cameron steps toward her without thinking. He wants her out
                of there.
          
                                            NINA
                                 What's happening?   What's going on?
          
                                            GABE
                                    (joking)
                                 Look who's here! Nina, we need you.
                                 Still got your makeup on?
          
                Nina, who by now has seen what's happening, laughs.
          
                                            NINA
                                 That's a daring touch, Raymond!    The
                                 rowboat. Terribly symbolic.
          
                There is general laughter, but not shared by Cameron. He
                surprisingly finds himself angry at Nina's presence here and
                everyone's easy familiarity toward her. She sees Cameron and Eli
                through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling.
                Eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din.
          
                                            ELI
                                    (kidding her)
                                 Just like the old days, huh kid?
                                 Remember the sunglasses and garter
                                 belts back when we got our start?
                                 Make you nostalgic?
          
                More laughter.   Nina turns to Cameron.
          
                                            NINA
                                 Hi Lancelot. What's a nice boy like
                                 you doing in a place like this?
                                 Going to rescue the maiden from the
                                 boat?
          
                                            ELI
                                 He just asked if he could do the
                                 rowing. Didn't you, kid?
          
                                       - 64 -
          
          
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Having fun with me, aren't you?
                          It's Eli's potty training class.
                          Show little Lucky the pretty lady.
                          Make dirt on the pretty lady. Watch
                          little Lucky puke. Trouble with you
                          is you think the whole world is your
                          own personal crapper.
                             (Cameron starts to exit)
                          Have yourself a time...Just wallow
                          around in it, man. Watching you
                          makes me feel like Mr. Clean.
          
          Cameron storms out in a rage. Eli watches with a thoughtful smile.
          Sam, who has witnessed the outburst, turns to Eli, furious:
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Goddamn little prudish bastard!
          
                                     ELI
                          No more than you and me...it's the
                          human condition. We just hide it
                          better.
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Are you kidding?...If That guy in
                          the rowboat was a Marine sticking a
                          bayonet in her instead of a cock,
                          that uptight son-of-a-bitch would
                          have saluted.
          
          Eli starts laughing.

                          rowboat, she looks exactly like your
                          daughter, Jennifer.

                          Goddamn you, Eli.   That's not funny!
          
          He grabs Eli by the shirt front, cocking his fist.

                Sam's anger fades to a sheepish grin, realizing he's fallen into
                Eli's trap. Where his daughter is concerned, he's just as prudish
                as Cameron. Eli snaps an affectionate headlock around Sam's neck.

                He elbows his way to center stage.

                On the folding chairs facing the PORTABLE SCREEN, a dozen people are
                silhouetted against the light from the projected dailies. Cameron
                enters, pausing so his eyes can adjust to the dark.

                In the dimness, Nina sits separated from Eli, Sam and a few others.
                On the screen, a World War I British biplane in steady flight is
                interrupted by a couple of subliminal cuts. Another subliminal
                flash holds and replaces the scene on the portable screen. It's a
                "NUDIE" SHOT -- a rear view of the lady taken in the rowboat the
                night before.

                The watchers all break up, recognizing the work of Raymond and Gabe.
          
                                              GABE

                As Nina laughs good-naturedly, the airplane is back on the portable
                screen.
          107   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last
                night, he walks over and sits down beside her.
          
                                              CAMERON

                Without even glancing at him, Nina gets up and moves to a chair some
                distance away. He is stunned, then angry. Then confounded. Then
                resigned to the ways of women, he goes over and sits beside her.
          
                                              CAMERON

                                   you as an equal go to your head.

                 child for talking.

                 Nina, close to tears, quickly gets up and hurries out of the
                 theater, as Cameron sits there numbly staring at the screen.

                 On the portable screen, Raymond in helmet and goggles is in the
                 cockpit of an airplane. He stuffs a bottle of champagne into a
                 leather flying boot, dangles the package over the side and lets it
                 go. Raymond looks down and salutes (like that famous scene in
                 "WINGS").

                 Eli's voice yells 'cut' on the sound track. The angle on the
                 portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the
                 ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymond's face.

                 Now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we
                 see the same biplane flying low. An object drops from the cockpit
                 (the boot). Then there is a burst of flame in the engine. Trailing
                 smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to
                 CAMERA). It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes
                 down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a
                 dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our
                 eyes during the crash. There are groans, laughter and raspberries
                 O.S.

                                wing of that plane? Picture that
                                because it would be a hell of a lot
                                realer than that flapping dummy.
          
          108   Cameron is startled.   He was not aware that Eli even knew he was in
                the room.

                                I thought you wanted something
                                outrageous!

          Reality can be pretty outrageous.
          Look at soldier boy there, jumping
          off fucking buildings, risking his
          ass every day, doing stuff way over
          his head!...What would you do in
          that plane, Lucky, if you were about
          to die?
          
                     CAMERON
             (off guard, embarrassed)
          What else? I'd dance for joy...I'd
          probably do a jig.
          
                      ELI
          Great!   That's what we'll do.

          You're damn right...

          The Charleston is silly...They won't
          believe it.
          
                     ELI

          109   (SHOCK CUT TO SKY) - CLOSE ON GERMAN FIGHTER PLANE - DAY
          
                It screams down vertically, full power, machine guns blazing, then
                smashes into the earth, shredding to fragments hurled in every
                direction. The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground.
                The plane's carcass explodes, filling the screen with fire and black
                smoke through which we see a brightly colored PARACHUTE descending.
                The FIGURE dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames
                and tumbles to the ground, rolling, his parachute now ablaze. It is
                Cameron dressed in a British flyer's uniform.
          110   ANGLE WIDENS
          
                To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabe's eye, Eli behind him,
                steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack
                as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness. With the camera,
                they crouch and move together like a three-headed, four-armed, four-
                legged creature.
          
                Banking steeply, a British fighter roars past Cameron, its wingtip
                almost brushing the ground, machine guns rattling, driving some
                advancing German soldiers back toward the woods.
          
                The plane touches down to rescue Cameron, the pilot beckoning.
                Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilot's boots and helmet.
                Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British
                plane. It is a single-seater. It starts to pick up speed. He
                grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing.
          
          111   ANGLE ON CONSTRUCTION CRANE
          
                The bucket hanging from the giant CRANE descends. Smoothly Eli
                guides Gabe backward, seating him in the bucket. The bucket rises,
                lifting Gabe while he photographs the scene, as the plane with
                Cameron on the wing becomes airborne.
          112   ANGLE ON PICKET FENCE
          
                Behind it is a CROWD OF SPECTATORS who jump up and down shrieking.
                CAMERA PANS to show Nina among them, her excitement hardly more
                controlled.

          113   ANGLE ON CRANE BUCKET AND BRITISH AIRPLANE
          
                The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane,
                completing Gabe's spectacular shot. Now we see a HELICOPTER drop
                into frame, photographing the plane from the other side. The
                chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight
                formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing
                struts like a flying Christ, as they soar into the sun.
          114   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Seated on the wing, his back against he fuselage, legs firmly
                against the struts. His white silk scarf streams into the tearing
                wind. Jamming a champagne bottle into the German's boot, he holds
                it up. The pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second
                bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream. Laughing, he passes a
                glass to Cameron and pours from above. The liquid is lost in the
                wind. Shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron.
                Cameron drinks. The champagne pours down his throat and face and,
                holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet.
          
                The pilot waggles his wings, giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his
                bottle back. Cameron now seems drunk. He lets go of the strut and
                stands leaning against the wind. As the pilot toasts his courage,
                Cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut.
          
                Now, Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of
                the wing. Then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane. The
                pilot starts to sing to Cameron's rhythm, "How ya gonna keep 'em
                down on the farm..." And Cameron dances the Charleston.

                Through the plastic bubble, the biplane can be seen in the distance
                going through its antic maneuvers.

                CLOSE ON BIPLANE
          
                Cameron holds the boot poised, lets go. Then, the pilot is struck
                by a bursting shell. As he slumps over, the plane skids and slips
                and drops off into a spin. Cameron clings for his life as the
                sickening momentum grows, until his feet are flung out from under
                him and he dangles from the wing, whipping in space.
          117   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the
                airplane is no longer in flight, but is dangling a few feet above
                the ground, suspended from the cable of the huge crane. The crewmen
                shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving. Cameron is,
                indeed, clinging to the wing strut, his feet held in space by the
                centrifugal force. But, if his hands slip, he will fall ten feet
                instead of to certain death.

          120   POV THROUGH LENS
          
                As the spin slows down and the plane appears to level out, Cameron
                regains his footing, perches on the wing and looks forward in
                growing horror.

                We see the rapidly approaching trees. Closer and closer, until with
                a horrendous crash, the plane sails between two trunks, shearing off
                the wingtips, the nose smashing into another, hurling Cameron off
                the wing like a crumb flicked from the table.
          123   EXTREME CLOSE UP - CAMERON
          
                Apparently hurtling through the air, his eyes widen at the impending
                impact. A gasp and then a sharp cry. But instead of the
                crash...the ANGLE WIDENS and we see it is Cameron reaching orgasm.
                With extreme contentment on his face, he rolls over revealing Nina,
                who, it is clear, has also had a lovely time.
          
          124   WIDER ANGLE - INT.   NINA'S HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
                They are in bed in a pleasant large room (the Queen Anne Suite),
                untidy, with script pages, wigs, costumes, fresh flowers, the
                leftovers of a room service dinner. Nina caresses his back,
                noticing bruises. She kisses them gently and starts to giggle. He
                looks at her quizzically.

                The ALARM CLOCK on the dresser BEGINS RINGING.   He sits up, puzzled.
          
                                           NINA (CONT'D)
                                I have to study my scene for
                                tomorrow. The Old Lady at the
                                cemetery. It's brutal. I set the
                                clock in case we dozed off.
          
                Cameron gets up, moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock,
                but instead stops at the stand holding the Old Lady wig. He runs
                his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring.
          
                                           CAMERON

                                Will ya turn off the clock?
          
                Subtly, we sense something is bothering Cameron.    He ignores the
                still-ringing clock.

                          than his love and he leaves me with
                          another little patriot in my belly.
          
          During this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head, glancing
          in the mirror.

                          I could use the money and I don't
                          look half bad.

                          Honey, you'll ruin it.    Take it off.
          
          He does.

                          The clock's electric. It'll ring
                          forever.
          
          Instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the Old Lady's dress
          on a hanger. He looks at the dress appraisingly.

                          big soldier as a little old lady.
          
          Disturbed, Nina leaves the bed, turns off the alarm clock and
          adjusts the wig properly on its stand.

          They embrace and cling to each other. She starts back for the bed,
          but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again, and
          again it BEGINS RINGING.

                          We've got to consider Eli. If you
                          don't study the scene, he'll be
                          mad...then you'll get mad...and I'll
                          get shot out of a cannon.
          
          With the alarm still ringing, he starts toward the bed.
          
                                     NINA
                          Did you fall on your head today?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I want it to ring.
          
                                    NINA
                          Why?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          For me, that's why. That's Eli
                          yelling for you to work on your
                          scene and us saying, "Up yours,
                          Eli," and I like that.
          
                                     NINA
                          Do you want to leave?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I want to make love to you while Eli
                          is screaming his head off.
          
          The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing. He gets
          on the bed with her. THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING. They struggle
          about, giggling at the absurdity.
          
                                     NINA
                          I can't make love with the clock
                          ringing.

                          Betcha can.
          
          While he moves over her body, she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at
          the clock. It falls over, but keeps on ringing. By now, Cameron
          has entered Nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that,
          than in the clock.

                              making love to Nina)
                          You tell 'em, Eli.

                 CLOSE ON MOVIOLA
          
                 In the darkness, the machine is like an ominous hunchback,
                 splattering shards of light against Chuck's intensely watching face.
                 He is highly disturbed at the unseen image.
          
                                               CHUCK
                                       (to himself)
                                    Crazy bastard!
          
                 ANGLE WIDENS, showing a small STORAGE ROOM has been converted to a
                 makeshift EDITING ROOM, where Chuck sits working the MOVIOLA.
                 Slowly becoming aware of someone, he glances up through the spinning
                 reels and dimly sees Cameron leaning in the doorway.
          
                                               CHUCK
                                    There was no way it could go
                                    wrong...unless he just went ape.
          
                 Cameron ambles over as Chuck reverses the film to see it one more
                 time. Even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward,
                 he realizes he's seeing BURT'S DEATH SCENE in the water. Now Chuck
                 has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward
                 again.
          125A   CLOSE UP - VIEWER OF MOVIOLA
          
                 The film whirs as we see through the windshield over Burt's
                 shoulder, the car flying through the air, hitting the water and
                 sinking beneath the surface. Burt goes through the motions of a man
                 trying to free himself.
          
                                               CHUCK

                                    holding...it all seems fine.

                                    ...Badly. Eli wouldn't use a foot
                                    of it...poor slob died for nothin'.
          
          126    ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                 Sweat is running down Cameron's face.    Finally, with dread...
          
                                               CAMERON
                                    That crack...in the windshield...

                                 What about it? Probably from the
                                 impact. No water coming in.
          
                Cameron's face reflects immense relief. At least he's not guilty of
                that. The flung stone was not the cause. Now, abruptly, Burt's
                body begins to move more violently.
          
                                            CHUCK'S VOICE
                                 There! Look at that. He's starting
                                 to panic. Will you, for Christ's
                                 sake, tell me why?
          
                As Chuck slows the film, we see Burt's head duck beneath the view of
                the underwater camera, leaving only the steering wheel and
                windshield. For an instant, the current changes the light and the
                crack glows brightly, like a spider web. Burt reappears, his face
                now toward camera, wild with terror. The slow motion lends a
                bizarre elegance to his agony. Abruptly, the FILM GOES BLACK.
          
                                            CHUCK

                                 his finger off the remote button.

                                 to end, with the flyer dying in the
                                 water?

                                 Burt, didn't it?
          
          127   INT.   REHEARSAL HALL - DAY
          
                In one of the private DINING ROOMS off the lobby, tables and chairs
                are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in
                progress. Some early morning TOURISTS have gathered outside the
                entrance, watching. A few members of the kitchen staff peer through
                an inside doorway. Sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as
                Eli rehearses with Nina.

                          The graveyard's over here...
                             (he takes a few steps)
                          ...Her car's parked here.
                             (sets down a folding
                              chair)
                          ...Lots of these little graveyards
                          along the roadside...most of the
                          stones are unmarked...
          
          He takes Nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him, kneeling on
          the floor.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          You're tired...you're broke...all
                          things which meant so much are gone.
                          What's left is a single memory...
                          that brief bright love.
          
          Nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye. Among the
          tourists at the doorway stands Cameron, who has paused to watch, his
          costume slung over his shoulder. He nods to her with a small tender
          smile. Subtly, so Eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews
          her concentration.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          ...You spent your month's pension in
                          hiring the car. You just can't look
                          for his grave any longer...so you
                          pick one...any one. You kneel...
                          then lay the flowers down.
                             (yells to the prop man)
                          What have we got for her?

                          I got roses.

                          No...something she picked herself...
                          wildflowers or something.
          
          Sam crosses over to them and kneels beside Eli and Nina.

                                 Eli. An idea, maybe. Instead of
                                 flowers, what if she brought him the
                                 things of their life together...of
                                 their sexuality...like her
                                 nightgown, her underclothes...
          
                Eli looks at him thoughtfully.

                From a paper bag, he takes a SMALL BRONZE CASTING of a BEAR and A
                GIRL on a SWING beneath a tree. He sets it down.
          
          128   INSERT ON THE BRONZE
          
                Sam's hand presses a lever on the side of the bronze. There is a
                whirring of the clockwork and a music box melody plays. The girl
                begins to swing. The bear slides toward her. She mechanically
                lifts her bronze dress until they meet, performing their clockwork
                love rite. Nina giggles.
          
                                            SAM'S VOICE
                                 It's authentic. Early Victorian.
                                 Mechanical bronzes were quite a
                                 thing.

                Eli begins to beam. Sam, realizing he has again fallen into the
                trap, winces, chagrined. Eli grabs him in a bear hug.

                Sam struggles to escape from the iron grip as Eli dances him about
                in joy.

                                I wanted to, but I was scared.

                                Hey Denise, for Christ's sake! We
                                got a set call in forty minutes.
          131   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                To include a MAKEUP TABLE against the far basement wall with THREE
                ACTORS sitting at it, wearing plastic aprons to shield their
                uniforms.
          
                                           DENISE
                                   (to Cameron)
                                You just sit here...dry...and
                                repent.
          
                She crosses to the men at the makeup table.
          
                                           ACTOR
                                Glad ya could tear yourself away.

                                 Don't panic. He's still got that
                                 whole big emotional thing to do with
                                 the dog food lady before they even
                                 get to you. You may not work 'til
                                 midnight.
          
                                            ACTOR
                                 You wait. Eli'll wave his wand and
                                 get it out of her in five minutes.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE
                                    (trimming his hair)
                                 You're confused...He got it into her
                                 in five minutes. To get it out of
                                 her...it takes longer.
          
                There is general knowing laughter as Denise crosses back to Cameron
                and sees by the look on his face she has hit her target. The
                thought of Nina and Eli as lovers had never occurred to Cameron.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

                The effect is stronger than she had expected.     Now compassion sets
                in.
          
                                            DENISE (CONT'D)

                                 Hey. C'mon, Red...I'm a woman
                                 scorned...I'll say anything.
          
                Cameron just sinks back in the chair, slowly dying.
          
                EXT.   GRAVEYARD - CLOSE ON "MECHANICAL BRONZE"
          132
                Over the tinkling sound of the music box, the BEAR and MAIDEN
                perform their ritual as the CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing the
                GRAVESTONE decorated with the worn filmy lace undergarments of
                another era. They flutter in the soft wind and amber light of a
                summer afternoon, strangely beautiful against the mossy granite
                marked "UNKNOWN." Somehow these rotting women's underthings have
                the dignity of a sacred tapestry draping an altar.

                                 beautiful...
          
                The ANGLE WIDENS and we see Nina, now made up to look wrinkled and
                gray, tragically old, her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave.

                          Why do I lie? I couldn't wait
                          either. I think both of us are
                          bears.
                             (a soft nostalgic smile)

          An elegantly-dressed CARIBINERRI (ITALIAN POLICEMAN) appears.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora...signora...
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          I'm almost finished.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora. This desecration... some
                          flowers perhaps...would be
                          permitted.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          But, we want these.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Please, signora. It's not right.
                          The grave is unmarked.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Ask the driver how many graves we
                          visited today. I could have chosen
                          five hours ago. I came here and my
                          soul said, "Oh yes." I know that is
                          hard to believe...
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                             (shrugging)
                          Anything is possible, signora.
                             (tries urging her to her
                              feet)
                          Now, you must permit me to escort
                          you to your car.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          As soon as I am gone, you will take
                          everything away.
          
                                    CARIBINERRI
                          No...
          
                                       - 84 -
          
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                             (tears streaming down her
                              face)
                          You will, and I can't stop you, and
                          it's wrong. We loved each other...
                          Where else should these go?
          
          The unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a SMALL GROUP
          OF PEOPLE who've gathered beside their PARKED CARS watching.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Yes, I know I'm ridiculous, but you
                          laugh without knowing anything. You
                          would buy a plastic wreath for a man
                          of such importance.
          
          She pulls free of the Caribinerri and, trying to kneel down,
          stumbles and falls. Now, like some confused child, she searches
          among the garments. Taking a SCROLL from a wooden box, she shakes
          it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          President Wilson...from the
                          President of the United States...for
                          heroism. To me for sheltering
                          him...
                             (smiling to herself)
                          How silly. I 'sheltered' him to be
                          with him. He was my beloved...Where
                          is it?...Oh, here, did you see this?
          
          She now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Given to me by Adolf Hitler...for
                          our son. Our son...
          
          Her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          ...Our son!!!
                             (then, with simple
                              reverence)
                          ...A thousand years of peace...is
                          what he said. That would be very
                          nice.
          
          The Caribinerri, spellbound, has taken a backward step, bumping into
          a REFLECTOR, which now teeters and falls into the scene, knocking
          off his hat, barely missing the Old Lady and crashing across the
          grave and shattering all illusion. The Caribinerri stands there
          
                                             - 85 -
          
          
                with his eyes closed and his fists clenched, wishing he were in the
                grave. Nina stands in speechless horror.

                It's deadly silent as Eli walks over to Nina.    They stare at each
                other for a moment.
          
                                           ELI

                performance. Tears of happiness run unabashedly down Sam's nose.
                Only Cameron is sullen, seething with anger and jealousy as he views

                          I'm tired of being somebody's
                          goddamn clown!

                          do it, but be happy! It's a great
                          day! Did you see her performance?
                          Terrific. It's a day for humility

                          Fine, Eli. Let's be brotherly.
                          Milk brothers, sucking from the same

          135   ANGLE - EXT.   FARMHOUSE - DAY
          
                As it explodes, Cameron is BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL -- ON FIRE. He
                tumbles to the ground, frantically writhes, rolls, trying to smother
                the flames, finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with
                muddy water. Cameron lifts his head at the approach of a THUNDERING
                SOUND...an ENGLISH CAISSON hurtles toward him, the driver dead and
                mangled over the barrel of the gun, the horses insane with terror.
                Before Cameron can move, the charging horses are on top of him. He
                rolls between their hooves, the giant steel wheel of the caisson
                barely missing him. Shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all
                about. Cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone
                wall for protection, drops to the other side and then hurtles into
                the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell.
          136   CLOSE ON TRAMPOLINE
          
                As Cameron falls into the shot, landing on a hidden TRAMPOLINE near
                the stone wall, bouncing up and down 'til he finally comes to rest.

                Cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as Henry, the
                assistant cameraman, uneasily faces Eli.
          
                                            HENRY
                                 We had a film run-out.

                Eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman, building to a
                rage we have not seen in him before.
          
                                            ELI

                                Thirty-six feet is nothing...
          
                                           ELI
                                It's twenty-two seconds! In twenty-
                                two seconds, I could break your
                                spine...I could pinch your fucking
                                head off like an insect and smear it
                                on the pavement...I could put
                                twenty-two bullets in that fat gut
                                of yours! The only thing I can't

                                keep you from fucking up my film!
          
                Cameron is so intrigued that he hasn't realized an EMBER is burning
                through his asbestos protector, until suddenly he feels the flame
                and frantically begins beating it out and thus, is even denied the
                pleasure of savoring Eli's anguish.
          138   EXTREME CLOSE UP - NINA (INT. SAM'S AND CAMERON'S ROOM - NIGHT)
          
                Rosy-faced and dewy-eyed and wearing a big floppy hat. Sensing
                trouble with Cameron and that she might be at fault, she has decided
                to do a campy, cutesy Blanche Dubois stepping off "THE STREETCAR
                NAMED DESIRE" number, ten years too soon.

          139   WIDER ANGLE - INT.   CAMERON'S AND SAM'S ROOM
          
                Sam has stopped typing and sits silently, waiting for the storm.
          
                Cameron lies on his bed in a T-shirt and shorts, an elastic bandage
                around his knee and an ice bag at his neck, coldly watching Nina's
                performance as she grandly moves through the doorway into the room.

                          invitation to an intimate party
                          given by my parents, who arrived
                          unexpectedly to honor me on the
                          occasion of my birthday...but don't
                          feel too badly. As consolation for
                          a lovely evening missed, I'm
                          presenting you with the "good-sport-
                          of-the-month" award.
          
          From behind her back, she takes an APPLE with a tiny cocktail
          parasol stuck in it and holds it out to Cameron. Cameron lies
          glaring at her with mounting rage.
          
                                     NINA (CONT'D)
                          Mr. Baum, will you notify this young
                          savage that it's customary to cover
                          one's privates when accepting an
                          award? It's one of the common
                          courtesies, like...congratulating
                          people.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (coldly)
                          What should I congratulate you for?
                          The fucking scene or for fucking the
                          director?
          
          Nina stands there shaken, looking at him sadly.
          
                                     NINA
                          For fucking the director, honey.
                             (biting into apple)
                          Didn't you know that's how little
                          girls get into the movies?
          
          She leaves. Cameron lies there seething, then abruptly leaps up and
          storms into the bathroom. Sam sits rubbing his head, resumes
          typing. Cameron rages out of the bathroom, flings himself onto the
          bed. Unwinding the elastic bandage, he sprays ethyl chloride on his
          knee. Sam's typing stops.
          
                                     SAM
                             (quietly)
                          Young man, taking my life in my

                          are an asshole.
          
          Cameron ignores Sam.

                          York. A brutal winter. Eli's

                          She could have done that in four
                          seconds. They went to bed once and
                          they were lousy as lovers. But they
                          had a problem. They liked each
                          other. They recognized some area of
                          mutual sensitivity. I'm boring you.

                          three years ago?

                          up in the employees' toilet.
          
          He begins to type again, then philosophically...

                          I think he 'banged' her twice to
                          confirm the awful truth...Was she
                          supposed to be a virgin?

          But he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that Sam knows he
          has reached him and it touched.

                                    I had a virgin once. Had to go to
                                    Guatemala for it. She was blind in
                                    one eye and had a stuffed alligator
                                    that said, "Welcome to Miami Beach!"
          
                Cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets. Then he gets
                up, goes to Sam's closet and begins rummaging through the clothes.
                Sam watches him curiously.

                is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table, a MAN and
                WOMAN in their early fifties and a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
                attractive despite the baby fat. Something about the composite of
                all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look.
                In doing so, he sees a half-eaten BIRTHDAY CAKE on their table, in
                front of an empty place. He goes to the table.

                                I was sort of invited to a birthday
                                party and I can't seem to find
                                it...and this seems to be a birthday
                                party...
          
                The FATHER, a hearty, bluff, good-natured man, looks at Cameron
                amiably and with a father's intuition.

                                party...sit down.
                                   (Cameron does)
                                Who was this birthday party for...
                                animal, vegetable or mineral?
          
                NANCY, the fourteen-year-old, giggles.

                                man?

                                She's really worth finding, ma'am.
                                She's a very rare mineral.

                                How old is this mineral?
          
                                           CAMERON
                                This morning she was acting about
                                ninety, but she might be lying a
                                year or two.
          
                The father now really comfortable, recognizing a fellow humorist.
          
                                           FATHER
                                No, you got the wrong table...this
                                one's acting like she's six...but
                                the missus tells me birthdays are
                                very emotional for the ladies.
          
                At this moment Cameron can tell from their faces that they've seen
                Nina behind him. He turns.

                Nina has emerged from the ladies' room looking miserable and is
                walking toward them. At the shock of seeing Cameron, her hand flies
                to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way
                she feels, that she starts back to the refuge of the ladies' room.
                Catching herself, she turns back to face him, her eyes now glowing
                with tears of happiness.

                He moves forward and kisses Nina. We now realize we are at her
                HOTEL ROOM DOOR. She on the inside, he on the outside, kissing
                through the doorway, which stands slightly ajar. With their mouths
                barely parting:
          
                                            NINA

                                    (slipping her room key in

                                 ...A permanent one?
          
                He puts his hand on the pocket and grins at her.

                On HENRY (the ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN who Eli screamed at), his luggage
                beside him, his elbows, empties, loose change scattered before him
                on the bar top.
          
                                            HENRY

          ANGLE shifts to include Cameron a few stools down.    He looks up from
          his beer and crosses to henry.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Guess who tole 'em to take their job
                          and stuff it?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Ya quittin'?
          
                                     HENRY
                          Fuckin' A. Gettin' out tonight.
                          But not without splittin' a Schlitz
                          with the one guy, 'cept me, who
                          wouldn't take shit from that
                          screwball.
          
          As the BARTENDER is taking away the empties, Henry puts his finger
          down on a DIME.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Change is for you, except that.
                          That's a very special dime.
                             (holds it up for Cameron
                              to see)
                          Know what this is? Ask me!
          
                                     CAMERON
                          It's a dime...am I close?
          
                                     HENRY
                          It's Eli Cross' ass. People think
                          'cause you're easygoin' they can
                          walk all over you. Bull-shit...I'm
                          blowin' the whistle with this dime
                          in that phone...killin' a man and
                          hiding it from the police...are you
                          kiddin'...? Who is he think he is?
          
          Cameron pales, knowing that drunken Henry's desire for revenge can
          expose him to the police. He grabs the dime from Henry's fingers
          and drops it into a PEANUT VENDING MACHINE.
          
                                     HENRY
                          What the hell you doin'?
          
          Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henry's shirt pocket, grabs his
          suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the FRONT DOOR.
          
                                    CAMERON
          
                                       - 95 -
          
          
                          I'm putting you in a cab for your
                          own good and sending you to the
                          airport. He's mine, Henry, all
                          mine. Just leave that son-of-a-
                          bitch to me!
          
          They have reached the HOTEL DOORWAY.   By now, Henry is convinced
          Cameron means business. He stops.
          
                                     HENRY
                          Do whatever you wanna do, but I
                          better do it with ya! You'll need
                          help 'cause that goddamn looney is
                          dangerous.

                          Not to me, he ain't. I'm going to
                          the cops. You gotta earn your
                          living in pictures, but I don't give
                          a shit. He can't hurt me.
          
                                     HENRY
                          Don't be too sure. Damned psycho
                          nearly strangled me! Don't believe
                          me? Wanna see marks...?

                          Henry, what are you talking about?
                          I watched that whole thing today, he
                          didn't even touch you.

                                   Not today. When Burt went into the
                                   water.
                                      (Cameron is wide-eyed)
                                   I could tell from up there in the
                                   chopper something' was wrong. So, I
                                   stopped shootin' and that crazy man
                                   gets me by the throat and starts
                                   screamin' to roll the film...I mean
                                   that guy's down there dying and he's
                                   screamin', "Keep shooting! Keep
                                   shooting!" Then, he starts fighting
                                   me for the switch and it falls
                                   down...like a crazy house up there,
                                   with him thrashin' on the floor...He
                                   didn't care about Burt. All he
                                   cared about was to get that man
                                   dyin' on film! Sickest thing I ever
                                   seen!
          
                As Henry's last words sink in, Cameron stands pale and shaken.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   I better grab that cab.
          
                Henry takes the suitcase from Cameron's numb hand and pushes through
                the door, looks back for a parting shot.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   You tell 'em everything...don't
                                   mince words...
          
                As he goes towards cab, some MERRYMAKERS push their way into the
                lobby.
          144   CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring ahead, Henry's words echo like his own death warrant. The
                merrymakers jostle past him, discussing suntan ointments. Cameron
                turns and walks across the HOTEL LOBBY and UP the STAIRS...his pace
                increasing until he is taking them three at a time.
          
          145   CLOSE ON DOOR LOCK
          
                Cameron's hand thrusts KEY into the hole, flings open the DOOR TO
                NINA'S BEDROOM and barges in.
          
                                              CAMERON

                 He FREEZES. Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the
                 bed. Raymond, also naked, sits slumped on the edge of the bed,
                 utterly disconsolate. The three stare at each other, an absurd
                 tableau. Cameron whirls and leaves, slamming the door behind him,
                 almost off its hinges.
          
          146    INT.   HOTEL LOBBY
          
                 He comes down the steps like a madman. Raging, Cameron stomps
                 across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of
                 Eli's grotesque wonderland. He collides with a group of returning
                 night FISHERMEN still in their slickers, carrying their equipment,
                 their catch wrapped in newspapers. For a moment he is tangled in
                 their tackle, FISH TUMBLING AND SLIDING along the marble floor.
          
                                             FISHERMAN
                                  Jesus...don't step on 'em.
          
                 Cameron stares at them, whirls and rushes back across the lobby and
                 up the stairs.

                 As Cameron bursts in.   She stands in her robe in the center of the
                 room, glaring at him.

                 Hearing WATER running in the bathtub, he dashes in, but finds the
                 bathroom empty. He moves to the closet and slides the door so
                 violently that it almost falls off: No Raymond.

          147A   In the HALLWAY, a little group of PASSING TOURISTS turn in
                 wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway. Nina leaves the
                 phone, crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the people's faces
                 with all her strength.

                 of Nina as a wild, radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running
                 pell-mell along a willow-lined VILLAGE STREET, dodging children and
          148A   bicycles. She collides with an OLD MAN, her basket falls, its
                 contents scattering; his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected
                 with her joy of life. He helps her refill the basket and she
                 rewards him with a sausage and a kiss. The old man watches her
                 wistfully as she runs away.

                The room dims and the film starts. We see a slate board reading
                "150A Take 1." The clapper claps and the board is removed,
                revealing an ATTIC. Nina sprawled on her stomach, stark naked, atop

                disappears as Eli's voice on the sound track calls, "ACTION." The
                ANGLE TIGHTENS into a less revealing, more artistic composition.
                Their mouths meet. Their bodies writhe.

                They stare at the screen in open-mouthed shock and horror. Their
                once gentle hands grip each other like iron claws, trying to squeeze
                away the nightmare.

                In shock and anger, leaning forward on the edge of his chair,
                looking from Eli to the parents, not knowing what to do to stop
                this.

                She's now made up to look like a woman in her forties. Everything
                about her tells us these have been brutal years, filled with pain
                and loss. She is reacting in anguish to something O.S. But, even
                though she manages a few tears, it doesn't quite ring true. Eli
                steps into the shot.

                TAPE insinuates into our consciousness, echoing as though heard
                through many loudspeakers.

                Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it
                dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera,
                only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned
                into her father's memory. And yet, that shame is so similar to the
                shame she should be feeling as the woman in Eli's film at this
                mockery of her son's death.

                The THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting: "Sieg Heil!
                Sieg Heil!" has shattered Nina's isolation. She is now aware that
                her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick,
                and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically
                making her performance even more poignant. The crowd on the
                playback roars with fanatic zeal.

                around at the official-looking faces staring at the O.S. film. One

                                 any questions.
          
                On the projection screen, we see the DUESENBERG GO OFF THE EDGE OF
                THE BRIDGE, disappear in the water.

                                 road...did you, Burt?

                The MAN Cameron couldn't recognize speaks out.
          
                                           OTHER MAN
                                My buddy and I saw that son-of-a-
                                bitch break out of the woods and
                                head that way, down the road.
          
                The lights go on and Cameron looks at the speaker, recognizing him
                as one of the TELEPHONE LINEMEN. Apparently, the lineman doesn't
                recognize Cameron in his new identity.
          
                                           LINEMAN

                Cameron follows Eli as the lights go out and the film begins again.

                Cameron moves swiftly down the corridor behind Eli, who starts up
                the stairs, still blithely chewing his gum.

                 Cameron understands the implied threat and Eli, knowing he has made
                 his point, continues good-humoredly.

                                 the Duesenberg. It's a dilly.
          166A   They have now charged out of the building and are racing across the
                 grounds toward the set.

                                 What about the version where I go
                                 over the bridge and die in the

                                 heroic! I think it's a major work
                                 that may rank with the Edsel grill!

                 He holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for Cameron to
                 reach out and take it. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the
                 FBI MEN leaving the building, heading off in another direction. He
                 stares at the booklet.

                                he could do was just stand there.
                                It was getting light. If we didn't
                                get out, we'd of been shot up. So
                                we left...
          
                Eli has been watching him thoughtfully.

                Eli blows a BUBBLE with his gum that POPS on cue as though it were
                the explosion of the bouncing Betty. Grinning, he sticks the
                booklet in Cameron's shirt pocket, turns and walks off.

                Scattered about the room are suitcases, a wardrobe trunk, the almost
                completed packing for tomorrow's departure. Nina lies in bed
                staring into nothing, Cameron beside her. Each is talking aloud to
                himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact
                with the other. The room is semi-dark, except for the nightstand
                light on Cameron's side, by which he studies the BOOKLET Eli gave
                him.

                          Did you know that Eli almost
                          strangled a man because he stopped
                          the camera when Burt got killed?!

                          had to tell Burt's brother on the
                          phone...I saw the tears.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          She saw the tears! Did you ask him
                          what he was crying about?! 'Cause
                          you can bet your sweet tits, it
                          wasn't over Burt. He was crying
                          over losing his fucking shot!
          
          To keep from exploding, Nina opens her luggage and furiously starts
          repacking.

                          twelve? Haven't you figured out yet
                          why he's working himself to death?
                          What his film is all about? He's
                          trying to tell people not to kill

                          what the son-of-a-bitch is saying,
                          and he may be right...which makes me

                          schmuck with a gun. That doesn't
                          change the fact that he's crazy. If
                          he had his way, there wouldn't be a
                          soldier left alive by morning. But

                          all he's got on hand is me. I don't
                          know if he is doing it consciously,
                          but it's a hell of an idea. If he
                          can really get it on film, a genuine
                          dumb fuck grunt cashing in, before
                          your very eyes, I mean the real
                          McCoy...that's gotta help his
                          picture...Then he's killed two birds
                          with one stone. It's got a nice
                          logic. Trouble is, both birds are
                          me.
          
          Against her instincts, Nina is emotionally affected by what Cameron
          says.

                          secrets around here.
          
          He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her.
          She leans against him, the trembling subsiding.

          When he doesn't answer, Nina resorts to her last defense, irrational
          anger.

          By now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one
          suitcase to another as Cameron silently watches her.

                Which stands alone like Moby Dick awaiting its victim. Chuck and
                Cameron appear from behind the car, stalking it like it were the
                Sunday Special on a used car lot, Chuck the "hearty" salesman,
                Cameron the reluctant customer.

                                 Why not?   You built a stunt man out
                                 of one.
          
                                            CHUCK

                                 already grown those big brass balls?

                                 clang, and then do me a favor and
                                 leave 'em home for this gag.
                                    (yanks open the door)
                                 There's just enough room in that
                                 Duesenberg for a normal guy...who
                                 thinks!
                                    (Cameron slides in)
                                 Show me how long you can hold your
                                 breath.
          
                Cameron inhales deeply and Chuck clicks his stopwatch.

                                     CHUCK
                          Now, look around. Whaddya see?...No
                          roll bar in the roof. That's
                          because the roof caving in really
                          looks gassy on film. You got your
                          protection in the back of the
                          seat...steel sheeting. If the roof
                          goes too far, you get your goddamn
                          head down quick! You listening to
                          me?!...Nod Your head.
                             (slapping Cameron on
                              back)
                          You got good lungs.
                             (buckles Cameron's
                              seatbelt)
                          You got no shoulder harness because
                          it would show on camera. So when
                          you hit the water, you brace
                          yourself against the steering wheel.
                          It's reinforced. You couldn't break
                          it loose with dynamite...you gettin'
                          light-headed yet?
          
          Cameron shakes his head, "No."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Keep your hands off the doors...
                          You're leaving through the window.
                          You lower them slowly as you sink to
                          equalize the pressure. What are you
                          waitin' for? I'm not gonna be down
                          there holding your hand.
                             (Cameron lowering
                              windows)
                          Slower. When you hit bottom, the
                          windows are open and you're gonna
                          make like a minnow. But first, a
                          little fresh air wouldn't hurt. You
                          reach down under the seat and, what
                          do you know, a respirator...Make
                          like you're reaching for it.
                          There'll be one there tomorrow.
          
          Cameron reaches for the non-existent respirator.

                          No, keep your face forward, the
                          camera is behind you and it's still
                          running.
          
                                              - 118 -
          
          
                 By this time, Cameron's breath is giving out and he's struggling to
                 hold it.
          
                                            CHUCK (CONT'D)
                                 You feel like your lungs are gonna
                                 burst? Good. That's the way you're
                                 supposed to act like you feel. The
                                 moment that water gets above your
                                 nose, you gotta look like you're
                                 drowning. Remember? Burt wasn't so
                                 good at that.
          
                 That knocks the wind out of Cameron.

                The POLICE STATION comes into view, seen through the window of the
                company car, which slows as it moves toward the curb. Eli, sitting
                on the front stoop, leans wearily against the stone lion. As he
                sees the car approach, he moves toward it quickly, opening the door
                almost before it stops.

                As the three enter. The station is old with a high sergeant's desk
                and wooden benches against the walls. Raymond, beyond tears,
                destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts,
                stoned kids, etc. On one bench is a SAILOR, with that adenoidal
                look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch"
                arrogance. Jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that
                he has finally nailed Eli Cross. Eli captures the setup in a
                glance...then, instant theater. He strides across the police
                station to Raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack
                on the mouth.

                Gabe has come up behind a PATROLMAN, grabs him by the hips and
                starts humping like a dog in heat. The policeman shrieks in dismay
                and tries to escape, but Gabe trots along as if they were locked.

                Gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor, who is agape with
                growing disbelief. Gabe ogles him.

                She is snuggled against him tenderly, her open mouth kissing his
                neck and cheek. Raymond, although aware of his desperate situation,
                is too sick with self-loathing to respond.

                against a lamppost, smoking a cigarette, as the charade goes on.

                                 get 'em outta here before they
                                 really do something illegal...and in
                                 front of witnesses!

                It's three o'clock in the morning. The corridors are empty as the
                elevator door swings open and Nina and Eli step out and move down
                the hallway, functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy.
          
                                            ELI
                                 Sorry I had to put you through that.
                                 I know it was humiliating.

                                 ...It was awful...I hated it.   But
                                 you did save that man's life.

                          Yeah, that was really nice of me.
                          I'm a nice person. I just wish I
                          had the strength to go to his room
                          and break his spine. On the last
                          day of filming the queen decides to
                          come out of the closet! Wouldn't
                          that have made a lovely headline?
                          You understand, of course, that the
                          film would've been destroyed. Doing
                          that to me...

                          Eli, what's wrong?
          
                                     ELI
                          Nothing serious.     Just a little
                          self-indulgence.     Feel-sorry-for-
                          Eli-time.
          
          Eli, on the edge of nervous exhaustion, is actually close to tears.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          I'm sorry, but you know...it's too
                          goddamn much. Why's everybody on my
                          back? When's somebody gonna say,
                          "There, there Eli?" I'm really
                          surrounded by friends, allies and
                          you..."What else can I do for your
                          film, Eli?"

                          That's not fair.
          
          They have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his
          separate way. They stop.
          
                                     ELI
                          What's not fair...getting my
                          feelings "hurt?" When did I lose
                          you to that soldier boy, Nina? That
                          nice, wholesome, swell-looking
                          kid...wanted by every cop, the FBI
                          and God knows who else, for God
                          knows what crime.
          
          Nina is paralyzed with shock.

                He walks off down the corridor.
          
          179   INT.   HOTEL BASEMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
                Partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing
                film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. In the
                cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy
                animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases,
                pulling them aside, searching. Discovering one, he sets it on the
                floor. It's locked. With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and
                eagerly rifles the contents. Then, sensing a presence, he turns.
                There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him. With only
                a glance to her, he goes on with his search.

                Cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket, moving along the row of
                suitcases. He pulls out a duffel bag, unzips it, shaking the

                 contents on the floor. Now with the open bag on his arm, he goes
                 along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket,
                 stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple
                 of work shirts, a heavy jacket. Passing a shelf of bayonets, he
                 picks one out and throws it in the bag.

          Cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to
          hurl it, he COLLIDES with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on
          his back. The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon PAINT CANS
          cascade on top of him. It looks disastrous. Nina runs to him,
          terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, Cameron
          emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing
          and screaming as he struggles to his feet.
          
          At the sight of him, Nina starts laughing. But Cameron, who has
          somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it
          over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin,
          screaming:
          
                                     CAMERON (CONT'D)
                          SCOOP THAT UP YOUR ROYAL BAVARIAN
                          STRAWBERRY SNATCH!
          
          With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had
          stepped in oil. In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on
          his ass in the green goo. Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable
          guffaw.

                             (bellowing)
                          It's not funny!
          
          Shamed, Nina runs to him.
          
                                     NINA
                          Oh, baby...
          
          But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and
          she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on
          her ass. His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a
          fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. These pratfalls are a catharsis
          that has released the pressure and the madness. They attempt to
          gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint. He succeeds,
          but Nina fails.

                             (through laughter)
                          Let me go to the bathroom.   I'm
                          gonna have an accident.

                          You'll miss the main part! Killer
                          Cameron's ghastly crime! I was
                          freaked out of my head! And,
                          suddenly there's this big flashlight
                          shining in my face. I just grabbed
                          that goddamn ice cream bucket and
                          slopped it...right over the guy's
                          head!
          
          Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging
          that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his
          balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina. Her
          hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing.

                          was a cop. I got out of there like
                          a shot. I didn't know he was
                          knocked out. How the hell did I
                          know he was gonna lay there all
                          night with his head in the ice
                          cream?

                          froze, see...and...
          
          Despite the horror of it, Nina starts giggling.   She can't help it.

          179H   Then, Cameron, realizing the absurdity, starts giggling too. Out of
                 control, Nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room.
                 Cameron follows her to the door, still talking as it closes behind
                 her.
          
                                             CAMERON (CONT'D)
                                  I'll tell ya, it's a bad year to
                                  mess with cops. You get the FBI

                 Abruptly, Cameron's energy is gone. The hilarity is over.   He leans
                 his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair.

          180    INT.   GARAGE - PRE-DAWN
          
                 The DUESENBERG STANDS silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting
                 dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin
                 waiting in the slumber room before services begin. Behind it, a
                 side door of the garage opens. But it is not visitors coming to pay
                 their last respects, it is Cameron and Nina. He is wearing Burt's
                 clothes.
          
                 Nina moves quickly to a WHITE CONVERTIBLE as Cameron crosses to the
                 big overhead garage doors and hits the electric SWITCH. NOTHING
                 HAPPENS. He flips another switch and harsh overhead lights
                 illuminate the reality of the garage. Nina has started the
                 convertible, as Cameron tries to lift the garage door handles.

                 Nina gasps. Cameron whirls towards the voice. A COP with a big
                 flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them.

                          to meet later...like in a Greyhound

          181   EXT.   THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING
          
                In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows
                move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones
                of the abandoned road. The ancient bridge spans the black river,
                idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the
                faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness. As it
                grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the
                trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll
                from the vibration.
          
                Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on
                bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back
                at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible
                carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short,
                tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable
                toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper
                dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like
                radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German
                army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the
                huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads,
                its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning
                hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians
                straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of
                these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the
                coffin on its caisson.
          
                The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the A.D., astride
                the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric
                bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of
                instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints.

                                is over. Another fifteen minutes
                                and we start losing sun. Come on,
                                let's get the equipment off those

                The Second A.D.'s run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers,
                snapping at their flanks, barking their instructions over electric
                horns.

                Grips and laborers are carrying the big reflectors through the brush
                into the hills.

                Being rolled up to a mark in the center of the road. Crewmen swarm;
                in and under it, tuning, polishing, testing, installing camera,
                sound, electrical equipment, as Chuck hovers over them.

                As motors rev, the two sheepdogs squawk: "Out of sight..." "Behind
                the bend...," then are lost in the rising dust of their herd.
          184   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                Cables are being strung out of sight along the side of the road,
                snapped into junction boxes that spread their electrified tentacles,
                strangling the landscape.

                Gabe, Chuck, the A.D. and a Technician move down the road toward us,
                shoulder to shoulder, halting on the bridge. Chuck and Gabe move to
                the stone railing. Chuck taps on it, producing a hollow sound.

          190   CLOSE ON DUESENBERG
          
                Cameron walks around it, testing and checking, but moving
                relentlessly toward the humpback trunk. A horn honks and a police
                car slides up. Jake leans out the window, waves at Cameron
                jovially.
          
                                           JAKE
                                How do you guys get accident
                                insurance? Must cost you an arm and
                                a leg...

                                ...that's a good one.
          
                He drives on toward a parked German army truck, in which lounge
                several soldiers. Chuck approaches Cameron.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                You're lookin' real strong, kid. Is

                They walk towards the German truck.

                                bridge.
          
                Cameron tenses at this information.

                                 off into space when you see 'em.
                                 They'll be shooting at you and
                                 that's what's supposed to make you
                                 go into the river.
          
          190A   They've reached the truck where Jake stands proudly. The Property
                 Man is handing out rifles and boxes of bullets to the German
                 soldiers, whom we now recognize as police officers from the town.
                 One cop, tying his shoe, lifts his head and grins at Cameron like an
                 old buddy -- the officer from the garage last night.

                 If Cameron was upset by the change in the stunt, he is now really
                 unnerved by the sight of those cops with guns. The second cop is
                 loading cartridges.

                As Cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then
                gently taps. He must get Nina out of there. With determination, he
                reaches for the trunk handle. Arms wearing the same costume as his
                own reach in, holding the trunk closed. It is Raymond.

                                    that red light out of the corner of

          The technician tightens a final screw on the red light then, leaning
          back out of the car, yells O.S.

                          Does it work?
          
          Cameron, barely hearing, looks straight ahead without response.
          Jake lounges at the driver's window, kibitzing the operation.

                          What?
          
          The words "CAMERA ON" sound exactly like "CAMERON." It sounded as
          though his real name was called and he automatically answered. Has
          his identity been exposed? His eyes widen. The technician, getting
          no response, calls to Jake.
          
                                     TECHNICIAN

          ignition key, the engine roars to life.

          Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic. In
          his mind, he's given himself away. The road ahead is clear -- GO!
          He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor. The
          Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly. In its wake -- chaos.
          Everyone running, yelling...

                Cameron grips the wheel, looking at that empty road. An involuntary
                shout swells up and escapes his mouth.

                The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five. Ahead, the bridge is rushing
                toward us. Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past.
                Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped.
                Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended. Suddenly the
                red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins
                whirring. He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up,
                (recalling that moment in the tower):

                The Duesenberg drops on one axle. Metal screams against stone, as
                though it were Cameron himself, screaming. Skidding, spinning,
                tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control
                into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward
                like a dying bird.

          198   INT.   DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          
                The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening,
                shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and
                soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera
                and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings
                himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to
                reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is
                buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the
                road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window,
                Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina,
                standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses
                downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image
                on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on
                Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water
                as the car plunges toward the bottom.
          
                Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is
                total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this --
                red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his
                death.

                Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles,
                to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a
                rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,
                crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear
                window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The
                memory of Chuck's voice..."the windows." He lowers the front window
                slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his
                chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.
                Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the
                oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The
                impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His
                groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every
                second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are
                as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager
                breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has
                broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must
                have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the
                water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness
                which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and
                toward the surface.

                Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in
                a desperate race to reach air.
          
                Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms
                to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at
                the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still
                moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him
                crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the
                fugitive, the "man on the run." Then, he lifts his head and stops
                at what he sees before him:
          
          200   POV
          
                Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready.
                Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward
                slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it
                closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron.
          201   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as
                though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their
                pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he
                sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet
                around him.
          
                Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him
                brutally about. Angry cop faced growling: "Kill the son-of-a-
          
                                               - 151 -
          
          
                bitch," "Shoot 'im," "Cut it," "Hang 'im," and then loudly, "Cut
                it!" He feels a blow on the back, then another. They seem too
                gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away.
                Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead? Then
                the jumble of voices is becoming clearer..."No matter what they pay
                you, make 'em give you a raise!"..."Fantastic, my wife thinks being
                a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific!" It finally sinks in,
                the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was
                all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
          
                He is alive and free. Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat
                the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle? Then it chokes
                into laughter.
          202   POV
          
                Here comes Chuck, running across the field with his silly stunt bag
                filled with elastic bandages. How funny. Here's the helicopter
                hovering with Gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for Eli,
                who runs to meet him. How hilarious. There's the pink
                pinafore...Nina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades
                through the tall grass towards him. How sweetly absurd.

                Chuck has reached Cameron, throwing a blanket over him.   He pulls a
                pint from his back pocket.
          
                                              CHUCK
                                   Take a belt. Don't be stingy.
          
                As Cameron tilts his head back, the bottle to his mouth, he sees
                skin divers setting down their rescue equipment and stripping out of
                their dripping wet-suits.

                Chuck, who is rubbing Cameron violently through the blanket to
                restore his circulation, replies with the highest compliment he can
                pay?

                Nina has reached an impasse twenty yards away in her journey of love
                toward Cameron -- a muddy section of swamp.

                Eli is standing nearby listening to this macabre exchange between

          205   CLOSE ON NINA
          
                Suddenly she turns, running headlong, pell-mell across the swamp and
                through the mud holes, drenching her pink pinafore into a muddy rag,
                losing a shoe, ripping her hose -- and then wildly into the arms of
                Cameron, smearing him with love and mud! And then, just as quickly,
                she is gone, racing back across the field, hopping like a rabbit
                without her shoe, toward the road.

                                the word is "action."
          
                He walks off, leaving Cameron draped in the blanket like an Indian.
                Eli steps up to him looking very serious, lifts his hand in the
                Indian sign of greeting and says:

                                before it was popular, I felt a

                          screenplay. He named the disease.
          
                                     SAM
                          Yeah, what?
          
                                     ELI
                          ...a social disease, very common.
          
                                     SAM
                          ...like gonorrhea...

                                     ELI
                          You're close. It's spread the same
                          way...by screwing your fellow man.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I hope you find an easier cure.
                          That was the hardest thousand bucks
                          I ever made.
          
          A horn honks. It is Jake who, in his enthusiasm, has driven the
          police car bumping over the marshes to Eli and Cameron.
          
                                     JAKE
                          You guys want a ride back?
          
                                     ELI
                             (moving toward the
                              helicopter)
                          No, we're goin' in the chopper.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (considers it)
                          Thanks, Eli, but that looks too
                          dangerous. I think I'll ride with
                          Jake. Good luck with the picture.
          
          He moves toward police car.
          
                                     ELI
                             (yelling to Cameron)
                          Don't miss that plane, Burt!
          
                                     JAKE
                             (leaning across Cameron
                              to yell at Eli)
                          He better not! Any member of your
                          company found within city limits
                          after five o'clock tonight, gets
                          shot on sight!
          
          Eli stops, suddenly registering what Cameron had said.
          
                                     ELI
                          ...What thousand bucks?   That stunt
                          paid six-fifty.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (surprised)
                          Chuck told me a thousand...
          
                                    ELI
          
                                        - 156 -
          
          
                             (firmly)
                          Six-fifty!
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (getting upset)
                          A thousand!
          
                                     ELI
                             (relenting)
                          Okay, seven-fifty.      Split the
                          difference...
          
                                      CAMERON
                          Bullshit!   You're trying to screw
                          me!!
          
                                     ELI
                             (exasperated)
                          Christ! You're doing it again!
                             (striding toward the
                              chopper, shouting)
                          Sam! This paranoid little bastard
                          still doesn't understand your damn
                          screenplay!
          
          Eli is climbing into the helicopter.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (shrieking)
                          That's your big problem, Eli! You
                          use people! I want my money, a
                          thousand bucks!
          
                                     ELI
                             (to Cameron)
                          Six-fifty!!
                             (to Sam)
                          Rewrite the battle scene and let the
                          tank run him over! The stunt pays
                          six-fifty!
          
          The helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a
          hammerhead and soars back, while Cameron continues to scream at it.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Come back here. I'm tired of being
                          your goddamn clown! Pay me my
                          thousand bucks!
          
          Eli's voice on the helicopter's P.A. speaker echoes through the
          canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away.

                     ELI'S VOICE (ON P.A.)
          How tall was King Kong...
