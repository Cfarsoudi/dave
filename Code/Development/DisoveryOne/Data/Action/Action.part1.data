	1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

	It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
	trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

	Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
	the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
	then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
	emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
	in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
	The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
	shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
	right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

	Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
	unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
	We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
	in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
	As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
	in a paisley design.

	Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
	ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
	Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
	no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

	The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
	AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
	about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
	laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
	US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
	with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

	Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
	screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
	appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
	we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
	Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
	savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
	they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
	They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
	They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
	as they move.

	The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
	mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

	We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
	running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
	painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
	FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
	and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
	around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
	are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
	frightened.

	An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
	on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
	TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
	dead.

	OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
	Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
	stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
	with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
	and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
	and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
	bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
	electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


		MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW


	2  TITLE SEQUENCE

	The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
	growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at, like the sun itself.

	Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
	again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
	is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
	cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
	distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
	stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
	MUSIC  now.

	We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
	as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
	close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
	CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
	Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
	shapes of :


	3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

	The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

	It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
	cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
	head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
	party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint. Charlie is going on and on :

				CHARLIE
		... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

				LAWYER
		What about oil ?

				CHARLIE
		Food, oil --look, let me show you
		something. This is the economy of
		the United States in two years --

	He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		This is West Germany.
			(he draws another,
			 bigger circle)
		This is Japan.
			(another , bigger)
		This is Italy.
			(a dot)
		This is Iran.
			(a very big circle)
		And this is Saudi Arabia... In
		two years ?
			(a gigantic circle)
		Do you understand ?

				ACCOUNTANT
		What's to prevent it ?

				CHARLIE
		Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
		I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing. We can protect
		our interests.
			(pause, for a drink)
		We are still the most powerful
		nation in the world. Militarily.

	He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		You know bodyguard; he was a
		captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
		him, except he won't talk. This
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

	The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		Carries a attache case at all
		times. You know what's in it ?
			(another sip)
		An Ingram Machine pistol.

	Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
	NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

		CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
	I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
	neither should this country.			with the ridge of your
	If we're strong, we should			hand to the throat; you
	protect our interests, and			can crush a skull with
	we should have the respect			your knee... but you
	of the world, even if it				can't kill anybody with
	takes another war.				your pinky.

	The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
	Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
	good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The attache case has been empty
		for three years, but it makes him
		safe to think there's a machine
		pistol in it.

		I don't like automatic weapons.
		They jam.

		I saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
		How much money did the contractors
		make on the M-16 ?

	Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
	reading, flirting, drinking.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		He likes to hear stories about Nam.
		I tell him I can't; they're not
		cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
		understand.

	We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
	opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
	MOVE CLOSER.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There's no way I can tell them...
		what really happened over there.

		I wouldn't've believed it if
		someone'd told me.

	We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
	from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There was only one part that
		mattered -- for me, anyway. I
		don't even know if I remember
		all of it. I can't remember
		how it ended, exactly -- because
		when it ended I was insane.

							DISSOLVE TO :

	4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY

	A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
	shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
	Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
	WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
	by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
	shoes and sell him things.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		But I know how it started
		for me -- I was on R. and R.
		in Saigon; my first time south
		of the DMZ in three months. I
		wasn't sure, but I thought this
		guy was following me.

	Willard looks back.


	5  HIS VIEW

	an American CIVILIAN.


	6  MED. VIEW

	Willard ducks into a bar.


	7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY

	Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
	tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
	crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
	past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
	sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

	An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
	drinks and approaches Willard's table.

				CAPTAIN
		How about a drink ?

				WILLARD
		Sure, thanks.

	He sits down at the table with the drinks.

				CAPTAIN
		Winning the war by yourself.

				WILLARD
			(he calls for the waiter)
		Part.

				CAPTAIN
		Which part is that ?

				WILLARD
		My part.
			(TO THE WAITER)
		Beer, with ice and water.

	   
				CAPTAIN
		That's good gin.

				WILLARD
		I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

				CAPTAIN
		Delta ?

				WILLARD
		No.

				CAPTAIN
		North ?

				WILLARD
		Yeah. Way north.

				CAPTAIN
		What unit were you with ?

				WILLARD
		None.

				CAPTAIN
		Rangers, eh?

				WILLARD
		Sort of.

	The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
	his shoulder.

				CAPTAIN
		Were you Longe Range Recon --

				WILLARD
		No -- I worked too far north for
		LRRP.

	He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
	Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
	notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
	then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

				CAPTAIN
		That's quite an array of ribbons...

				WILLARD
		Let's talk about you.

				CAPTAIN
		I was an FO for the 25th.

				WILLARD
		Tracks ?

				CAPTAIN
		Yeah.

				WILLARD
		Fat. That's real fat.

				CAPTAIN
		Sometimes.

				WILLARD
		At least you always have enough
		water. How many gallons does
		each one of those damn things
		carry ?

				CAPTAIN
		Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

				WILLARD
		You know, I can remember once,
		getting back below the DMZ -- and
		the first Americans we ran into
		were a track squadron. I just
		couldn't believe how much water
		they had. We'd been chewing
		bamboo shoots for almost a week,
		and before that, for two weeks,
		we'd been drinking anything --
		rain water, river shit, stuff
		right out of the paddies. And
		there were these guys standing
		by their trucks spilling water
		all over. I could've killed them.
			(solemnly)
		I swear to God I would have, too,
		if ...

				CAPTAIN
		I didn't know we had units up
		there in North Vietnam.

				WILLARD
		We do.

				CAPTAIN
		How long were you up there ?

				WILLARD
		A long time.

				CAPTAIN
		A year ? Waiter another beer.

				WILLARD
		I go up on missions. Listen
		Captain, buy me all the beer
		you want, but you better tell
		that asshole over there you're
		not going to find out anymore
		about me.

	Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
	Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
	He rises and comes over to the bar.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		What do you want ?

				CIVILIAN
			(indicating the Army jeep)
		If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
		Group, we'd like you to come with
		us.

				WILLARD
		Whose orders ?

				CAPTAIN
		Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
		A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
		Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
		Nha Trang.

				WILLARD
		Who are you ?

				CIVILIAN
		The agency.

	Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
	The Civilian follows.


	8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

	A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
	wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified, concealed compound.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		They took me to some place outside
		Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
		for all operations in South East Asia.
		I'd worked for Intelligence before --

	Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
	large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
	corridor -- they enter.


	9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

	A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
	attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
	reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke.

	The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it.

				WILLARD
		Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
		reporting as ordered, sir.

				COLONEL (O.S.)
		Okay, Willard, sit down.

	Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
	and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
	him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

				COLONEL
		Have you ever seen this officer
		before, Captain Willard ?

	He points to the Major.

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		This gentleman or myself ?

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		I believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in Kontum,
		is that right ?

				WILLARD
		I am not presently disposed to
		discuss that, sir.

				MAJOR
		Very good.

	He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
	Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

				COLONEL
		You know much about about Special Forces;
		Green Berets, Captain ?

				WILLARD
		I've worked with them on occasions
		and I saw the movie , sir.

	The officer smiles at this.

				COLONEL
		Then you can appreciate Command's
		concern over their -- shall we say
		'erratic' methods of operation.
			(pause)
		I have never favored elite units,
		Captain, including your paratroopers
		or whatever. Just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesn't give him any
		priviliges in my book -- not in
		this man's army.

				MAJOR
		We didn't need 'em in Korea --
		no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
		and an M-1 Garand, none of this
		fancy crap -- no sir.

				CIVILIAN
			(stopping him)
		Major.

				COLONEL
		We have Special Forces A
		detachments all along the
		Cambodian border. Two here and
		another one here -- twelve or
		fourteen Americans -- pretty
		much on their own; they train
		and motivate Montagnard natives;
		pick their own operations. If
		they need something, they call 
		for it, and get it within
		reason. What we're concerned
		with is here.


	10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP

				COLONEL
		The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
		It was originally a larger base,
		built up along the river in an
		old Cambodian fortress.
	
		The area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years --
		but --


	11  MED VIEW

				COLONEL
		... Captain, we know something's
		going on up there -- Major --

	The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

				MAJOR
		Communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of V.C. activity,
		this is routine, expected ... but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped.

				COLONEL
		About the same time -- large numbers
		of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
		began leaving the area -- this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the Rhade
		Tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries. But what is unusual is
		that we began to find Rhade refugees
		too -- in the same sampans as the
		M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
		of V.C. They've put up with war
		for twenty years -- but something
		is driving them out.

				MAJOR
		We communicate with the base
		infrequently. What they call for
		are air strikes, immediate --
		always at night. And we don't
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on.

				WILLARD
		Who ?

				MAJOR
		You see, no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive.

				WILLARD
		Why me ?

				MAJOR
		Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
		Special Forces. We understand
		you knew him.

	He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				COLONEL
		He's commanding the detachment
		at Nu Mung Ba.

	The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
	flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
	AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
	coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
	Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
	someone dumb, except very fast.

				VOICE (ON TAPE)
		Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
		Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
		Immediate receive -- hearing
		automatic weapons fire man ...

	GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

				SECOND VOICE
		Blue Delta five
		This Big Rhine -- three
		Need that ordinance immediately
		Goddamn give it to me immediate
		Christ -- Big Rhino --
		Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

	A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
	-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
	MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
	peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

				THIRD VOICE
		This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

				MAJOR
		That's Colonel Kurtz.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		I want that napalm dropped in the
		trees -- spread it among the
		branches.

		We'll give you a flare -- an
		orange one -- bright orange.
			(STATIC)
		We'd also like some white phosporous,
		Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
		it to me.

	STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

				WILLARD
		I only met Kurtz once.

				CIVILIAN
		Would he remember you ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				COLONEL
		What was your impression of him ?

	Willard shrugs.

				CIVILIAN
		You didn't like him.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a cigarette.

	The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I thought he was a lame.

				COLONEL
		A lame ?

				WILLARD
		This is years ago, before he
		joined Special Forces, I guess.
		We had an argument.

				COLONEL
		About what ?

				WILLARD
		I don't know. He was a lame,
		that's all.

				COLONEL
		But why ?

				WILLARD
		He couldn't get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words; about why we kill.

				COLONEL
		Well, he's killing now.

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				CIVILIAN
		What does that mean ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
		believe he's capable of that.
		I just don't believe it.

				COLONEL
		It's got to be Kurtz.

				CIVILIAN
		The point is that Kurtz or
		somebody attacked a South
		Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
		days ago. Last week a Recon
		helicopter was lost in the area --
		another took heavy damage --
		direct fire from their base
		camp.

				WILLARD
		Our Recon flight ?

				CIVILIAN
		Ours.

				WILLARD
		Touchy.

				CIVILIAN
		You can see, of course, the
		implications, if any of this --
		even rumours leaked out.

				WILLARD
		You want me to clean it up --
		simple and quiet.

				CIVILIAN
		Exactly -- you'll go up the
		Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
		appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
		accident, re-establish your
		acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
		find out what's happened -- and
		why. Then terminate his command.

				WILLARD
		Terminate ?

				CIVILIAN
		Terminate with extreme prejudice.


	12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA

	A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
	divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

	A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
	This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
	armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
	military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
	dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
	M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.


	13  MED. VIEW

	We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
			
				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
		pretty much all kids, except for
		Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
		Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
		Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
		Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
		Radio Operator Second Class T.
		Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

				WILLARD
		Chief, try to keep out of where
		we're going -- Why we're goin' and
		what's gonna be the big surprise.

				CHIEF
		All right with me, I used to drive
		a taxi.

				WILLARD
		Let's go.

	The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
	and otherwise go about their work.

	The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
	the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
	twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
	on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
	to the ocean.

	14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA

	The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the
	top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another.


	15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF

	Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.
	Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The
	Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs
	back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
	stares ahead into space, swallowing.

	16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK

	The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds --
	the sea is calm again.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST

	The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

				CHIEF
		The Delta closes off to us about
		ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
		be able to pick up some supplies --
		bit I think there are only two
		points we can draw enough water
		to get into the Nung River. It's
		all Charlie's turf from there on
		out.

				WILLARD
		We're gonna have some help to
		get in the river. You know
		these waters, Chief ?

				CHIEF
		'Bout six months ago I took a man
		up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
		regular Army too. Shot himself
		in the head. I brought his body 
		back down.

				WILLARD
		Shot himself. What for ?

				CHIEF
		Beats me -- the sun was too much
		for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

	Pause, looking at Willard.


	18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

	Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
	buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
	is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
	the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
	stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

				WILLARD
		Arch light.

				CHEF
		I hate that -- Every time I hear
		that noise something terrible 
		happens.

				CHIEF
		Anybody see some smoke ?

				CLEAN
		Too far inland.

				LANCE
		There they are.

	He points up to the sky.


	19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY

	Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
	the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
	trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
		till it's too late -- don't have
		to hit you neither, concussion'll
		do it for a quarter mile or better.
		Burst your ears -- suck the air
		outta your lungs.


	20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW

	They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
	He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
	flips through the letters and other documents.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier on A detachment had
		letters from Kurtz' wife and the
		wives and families of his men.
		All asking where to send future
		mail, understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work -- None of the men had
		written home in half a year.

	Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting

	studying, examining a report.


	22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

	Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
	as Willard reads :

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and well-disciplined
		spirit. He is a fine officer,
		combining military efficiency --
		with a broad background in the
		Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

	Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
	161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... He views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker, less
		fortunate areas in the world.

	A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
		for Special Forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns, and
		his somewhat liberal politics,
		though I can see no reason to
		deny it.

	A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
	jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
		bring a sense of Western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
		programs ...

	MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just
	a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

	23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		One day later we came to an
		advanced staging area along the
		coast. This was our last chance
		to pick up supplies before
		approaching the mouth of the
		Nung River.
		 
	The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
	ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
	tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

	Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
	helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
	advanced staging areas like the Americans.

	As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
	something.

				LANCE
		Hey.

	They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
	skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
	one another.


	24  VIEW ON THE DOCK

	The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- I want you to go with the
		Captain an' get three extra drums
		of fuel and maybe scrounge some
		more 50 caliber.

				LANCE
		Yeah -- look at those uniforms.


	25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
	pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
	airplane.

				CHIEF
		Poor bastards, have a long year
		to go.

	The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
	Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


	26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
	ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

				SERGEANT
		I don't know anything about these
		papers, sir.

				WILLARD
		They're in order -- it's perfectly
		clean -- just check with ComSec-
		Intel like I said.

				SERGEANT
		Well, you know I don't have the
		priority to do that, sir. It
		says here not to contact Com-Sec-
		Int. Who's your commanding 
		officer ?

				WILLARD
		Right now -- I am.

				SERGEANT
		Well who the hell verifies that ?

				WILLARD
		I do.

	He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

				CHIEF
		No shit -- what's all the activity
		for around here ?

				SERGEANT
		The show --

				WILLARD
		What show ?

				SERGEANT
		Big show in the parade grounds
		this noon -- some boss stuff --

				WILLARD
		This -- Bob Hope or the like --

				SERGEANT
		No sir, I think -- this'll be a
		little bit different --

				CHIEF
		Where's it gonna be ?

	He points --


	27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

	A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
	surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
	garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

							DISSOLVE TO :


	28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
	wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
	of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
	the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
	see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
	surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
	or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
	the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
	this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
	lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
	herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
	armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


	29 FORWARD AREA

	jammed in the crowd

				CHEF
		It's really too much -- I mean
		I've collected every picture of
		her since she was Miss December.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- you can really get hung
		up on them like the cat in the
		Delta.

				CHIEF
		What cat  ?

				CLEAN
		One that went up for murder -- he
		was an Army Sergeant.

				CHIEF
		I never heard about that.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
		mag, man -- I mean like he was there
		when it arrived -- He just knew.

				CHEF
		So what happened ?

				CLEAN
		He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
		and had one a them little cocky
		gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
		the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
		one day, sat on the end of the dock,
		and wouldn't give it back.

				CHEF
		Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

				CLEAN
		Then went too far -- he sat
		there and starts mutilating the
		centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
		all that. Sergeant says, don't do
		her like that. You leave your
		shitty little hands off that girl.
		Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
		Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
		do that again. You'll wish you
		hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
		his iron to rock and roll and gave
		the little zero a long burst
		through the Playboy mag. Man, it
		blew him clean off the dock --
		Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
		there all full of holes.

				CHIEF
		They nail him for it bad ?

				CLEAN
		He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
		give him no medals or nothing --

	In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
	MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
	All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
	On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
	Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
	copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
	step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
	abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
	is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
	but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man.

	He walks over to the microphone.

				AGENT
		I'd like to say hello from all of
		us up here, to all of you out there.
		All of you who've worked so hard
		during Operation Brute Force --
		Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
		-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
		And I want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is. To prove it -- we've brought
		some entertainment we think you're
		gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
		and her two runners up !

	He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
	"Suzy Q."


	30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

	VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner -- smiling.

	The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
	look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
	cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness.

	Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
	their need increases by the square.


	31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

	They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
	wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
	-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
	which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
	then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
	Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
	Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

	Such are the ways of war.

							CUT TO:


	32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

	The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
	There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no
	boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
		nothing but us and the coastline.
		I felt like I had set off for
		the center of the earth...

	Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

				CHIEF
		Smoke !

				WILLARD
		Where ?

	They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


	33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

	A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

				WILLARD
		Black smoke ... secondary burning.

	The Chief grabs field glasses.

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- fishing village --
		helicopters over there. Hueys,
		lots of 'em.

				WILLARD
		First Air Cavalry. They're the
		ones gonna get us into the River.


	34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

	A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
	trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
	-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
	surf.


	35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

	They wade through the water to the beach where they are
	met by a heavily armed group of men.

	Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
	out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

	We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
	Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


	36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
	machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
	side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
	a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
	pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
	from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
	strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
	neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
	-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

	He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
	is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
	walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
	His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
		back about a hundred yards -- give
		me some room to breathe.

	A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.


	37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He was not quite prepared for this.


	38  VIEW ON KILGORE

	turning to his GUARDS

				KILGORE
		Bring me some cards.

				GUARD
		Sir ?

				KILGORE
		Body cards, you damn fool --
		cards !

	The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
	packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
	soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
	well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
	about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
	up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

				WILLARD
			(formally)
		Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
		Recon Group -- I carry priority
		papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
		11 Corp -- I believe you understand
		the nature of my mission.

				KILGORE
			(not looking up)
		Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
		expect you -- we'll see what we
		can do. Just stay out of my way
		till this is done, Captain.

	He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
	deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
	right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
	others follow,


	39  TRACKING VIEW

	The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
	devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
	comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
	it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
		Isn't one worth a Jack in this
		whole place.

	The Colonel goes on about this business.


	40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

	moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

	On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
	something to him. He stops.

				KILGORE
		What ? Here. You sure?

	The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
	the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
	young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
	Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's your name, sailor ?

				LANCE
		Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
		L. Johnson, sir.

				KILGORE
		Lance Johnson? The surfer?

				LANCE
		That's right, sir.

	Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

				KILGORE
		It's an honor to meet you Lance.
		I've admired your nose-riding for
		years -- I like your cutback, too.
		I think you have the best cutback
		there is.

				LANCE
		Thank you, sir.

				KILGORE
		You can cut out the sir, Lance --
		I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
		foot.


	41 VIEW ON WILLARD

	His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
	background.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
		This is Mike from San Diego and
		Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
		solid surfers -- none of us are
		anywhere near your class, though.

	Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

				WILLARD
		My orders are from Com-Sec
		Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

				KILGORE
		Just hold up a second, Captain --
		I'll get to you soon enough --
		We've got things to do here.

	Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
	Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
	discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we do a lot of surfing around
		here. Like to finish up operations
		early and fly down to Vung Tau for
		the evening glass. Have you ever
		surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
		liked the beach breaks around Na
		Trang a lot -- good lefts.

	He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
	bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we keep three boards in my
		Command Huey at all times. You
		never can tell when you're gonna
		run into something good. I got a
		guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
		a swell two days in advance. We
		try to work it in.

	He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
	has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
	horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
		one.

	He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


	42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

	We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
	Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
	has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
	it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

				KILGORE
		Where've you been riding, Lance?

				LANCE
		I haven't surfed since I got here.

				KILGORE
		That's terrible -- we'll change 
		that -- I'd like to see you work --
		I've always liked your cutback;
		got a hell of a left turn, too.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

	Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by
	a table set up in front of the command copter.

	Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
	drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
	BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell you wanna go up
		to Nu Mung Ba for?

				WILLARD
		I got bored in Saigon.

				KILGORE
		What's the furthest you been
		in?

				WILLARD
		Haiphong.

				KILGORE
		Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

				WILLARD
		No. Walked.

				KILGORE
		What'd you do for supplies?

				WILLARD
			(he shrugs)
		Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
		they put out caches.

				KILGORE
		Can you trust them?

				WILLARD
		No. They put out two or three
		for every one I needed. When
		you get to the one you'll use,
		you just stake it out. If
		something feels wrong, you just
		pass it up. On one mission, I
		had to pass up three and ended
		up living on rats and chocolate
		 bars.

				KILGORE
		Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
		Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
		detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

				WILLARD
		When did you hear?

				KILGORE
		'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
		still alive?

				WILLARD
		Who knows.

				KILGORE
		Seems to me he got himself
		fragged. i heard some grunt
		rolled a grenade in his tent.
		Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
		remarkable officer. Walter
		Kurtz woulda been a General
		some day. General of the Army.
		Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
		of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		Don't you agree?

				WILLARD
		He musta changed !
			(pointing to the map)
		I got to get into the Nung
		River, here or here.

				KILGORE
		That village you're pointing at
		is kinda hairy.

				WILLARD
		Hairy ?

				KILGORE
		I mean it's hairy -- they got some
		pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
		I've lost a few recon ships in
		there now and again.

				WILLARD
		So? I heard you had a good bunch
		of killers here.

				KILGORE
		And I don't intend to get some of
		them chewed up just to get your
		tub put in the mouth of the
		goddman Nung River. You say you
		don't know Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		You talk like him. I don't
		mind taking casualties,
		Captain, but I like to keep
		my ratio ten to one in this
		unit -- ten Cong to one.

				WILLARD
		You'll find enough Cong up there.

				KILGORE
		What about this point here?

	He puts his finger on the map.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's the name of that goddamn
		village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
		names all sound the same.

	He motions to one of his surfers.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Mike, you know anything about
		the point at Vin Drip Drop?

				MIKE
		Boss left.

				KILGORE
		What do you mean?

				MIKE
		It's really long left slide,
		breaks on the short side of the
		point -- catches a south swell.

				LANCE
		Nice.

	Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell didn't you tell me
		about that place -- a good left.
			(to Willard)
		There aren't any good left slides
		in this whole, shitty country.
		It's all goddamn beach break.

				MIKE
		It's hairy ,though. That's
		where we lost McDonnel -- they
		shot the hell out of us. It's
		Charlie's point.

				KILGORE
		How big it is?

				MIKE
		Six to eight feet.

	Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		A six-foot left.

	Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

				LANCE
		Boss. What's the wind like.

				MIKE
		Light off shore -- really hollow.

				WILLARD
		We could go in tomorrow at dawn
		-- there's always off-shore wind
		in the morning.

				CHIEF
		The draft of that river might be
		too shallow on the point.

				KILGORE
		Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
		lay it down like a baby, right
		where you want it. This is the
		Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
		take that point and hold it as
		long as I like -- and you can
		get anywhere you want up that
		river that suits you, Captain.
		Hell, a six foot left.
			(he turns to an advisor)
		You take a gunship back to division
		-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
		him pick out a board, and bring me
		my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

				TOM
		I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

				KILGORE
			(hard)
		What is it?

				TOM
		Well, I mean it's hairy in there
		-- it's Charlie's point.

	Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

				WILLARD
		Charlie don't surf.

	CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the

	And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited
	very few of them really scared -- they fondle their

	claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers;
	M-60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars
	and bayonets.


	50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

		We'll come in low out of the rising

	Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being

	Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;

	COPTERS almost drown them out. The gunner FIRES
	frantically -- COPTERS are ROARING over -- GUNFIRE
	rips around. The gunner is blown away.


	62  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	as the ship he is in swoops down, its MACHINE GUNS
	FIRING into the village.


	63  MED. SHOT - SWOOPING COPTER

	The Pilot leans out and SHOOTS a charging V.C. in the
	head with his .38, then ducks back in.

				CO-PILOT
		We're down, Eagle Thrust -- we're
		hit. We got a hot L.Z. here.

	BULLETS RIP through the plexiglass. The Pilot FIRES
	back.

				CO-PILOT
			(continuing)
		Hell of a hot L.Z. Need immediate
		air strike on the tree line, Eagle
		Thrust.


	64  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, KILGORE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore has R.T. equipment -- he leans out near the
	door gunner.

				KILGORE
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four
		-- bring it in on along tree line
		and huts.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke
		Six -- we'll need green smoke --
		suggest you have the FAC mark it.

				KILGORE
		Haven't got time, Hell's Angels --
		lay it right up the tree line.


	65  FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON

	Four F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the
	coast.


	66  INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE

				KILGORE
		Fucking savages.
			
				WILLARD
		Who?
	
				KILGORE
		The enemy. Who else?


	67  HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS

	The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange
	napalm along the trees.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
			(on radio)
		Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest
		you follow with cannon fire.


	68  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT

	They circle the battle.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		This is Baker Delta Four --
		Captain hit bad -- need dust-off.
		Receiving heavy automatic weapons
		fire from huts about thirty yards
		to our left.

				KILGORE
		Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four
		-- hold -- we're right over you.

	He turns to door gunner.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Right along the doors, boy.

	The gunner FIRES leaning out --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Fine... fine... little higher.
		Through the roof; yeah, that's
		good.

	He leans back in.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Didn't anybody bring me any
		bombs, grenades, claymores or
		anything?

				LIEUTENANT
		You didn't tell me to, sir.

				KILGORE
			(grumbling)
		You shoulda known.

	Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass
	SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore
	is thrown down where he hangs on.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

				WILLARD
		Automatic weapons flashes along
		those trees -- probably eleven
		millimeter guns and AK-47's.

				KILGORE
		The trees, eh...

	He grabs the R.T.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke
		Six. Join me in sparaying some
		trees.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're
		even got some rockets left.

				KILGORE
		Take her in low, Lieutenant.


	69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS

	The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast
	the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through
	the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around
	them -- they scream and fall FIRING back.


	70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through
	the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows
	them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of
	them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third.

				KILGORE
		Hold it, boy.

	He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings
	back inside.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Take her up to 300 feet,
		Lieutenant.

	They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for
	all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who
	steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's
	harness.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Rifle.

	A hand passes him a M-16.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; hard)
		My rifle, soldier.

	There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300
	Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl
	inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and
	opens the bolt.


	71  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Amazed at these proceedings.


	72  VIEW ON KILGORE

	as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets
	into the sling and slams the bolt shut.


	73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

	He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.
	The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him
	on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol.


	74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes
	careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.
	Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent
	cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back
	into the copter.


	75  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The gaudy rifle passed by him.

				SOLDIER  (O.S.)
		That's 27, sir.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a card?

	Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and
	flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from
	Kilgore.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	76  FULL SHOT - BATTLEFIELD - THE CAV, V.C.

	Americans run through the hooches FIRING and throwing
	GRENADES. Helicopters swoop overhead -- JETS ROAR by
	-- Uniformed N.V.A. regulars burst from a tunnel en-
	trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at
	point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut
	down.


	77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

	Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-
	field. He has the R.T.

	He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak
	to Lance.

				KILGORE
		The L.Z.'s cooling off fast --
		we'll move in another company
		an' then we'll own it.
			(he laughs to himself)
		Charlie's point.

	He looks out toward the ocean.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Good swell.

				LANCE
		What, sir?

				KILGORE
		I said it's a good swell -- hell
		of a good swell 'bout six feet.
		Let's get a look at it.

	Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.


	78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

	The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply
	and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low
	over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up
	green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up
	at the last minute as the wave breaks.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

	Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.
	regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is
	DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round
	SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a
	southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.
	Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
	emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
	Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
	The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM
	over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another
	Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The
	doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and
	out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter
	are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the
	P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.


	80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore
	stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A
	SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

				SOLDIER
		Incoming !

	They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set
	-- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards
	away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is
	unmoved.

				KILGORE
		Look at that.

	They look.

				LANCE
		This  L.Z. is still pretty hot,
		sir, maybe we oughta stand
		somewhere else.

	Kilgore pays him no mention.

				WILLARD
		I'm waiting for the fucking boat,
		Colonel.

				KILGORE
			(without looking)
		It'll get here, soldier.

	He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the
	sand.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Change.

				MIKE
		Wh -- what?

				KILGORE
		Change -- get out there -- I
		want'a see if it's ridable --
		change.

				MIKE
		It's still pretty hairy, sir.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		You want'a surf, soldier?

	He nods yes meakly.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		That's good, boy, because it's
		either surf or fight.

	They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from
	one of the guards. They all think he's going to
	shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
		all.

	He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
	Colonel walks over.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		You think that section on the
		 point is ridable, Lance?

				LANCE
		I think we ought to wait for
		the tide to come in.

	A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except
	for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the
	air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

				KILGORE
		Doesn't happen for six hours.

	Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto
	his helmet.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The tide -- doesn't come in for
		six hours.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

	They walk through shallows carrying brightly
	colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM
	overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by
	carrying out wounded.

	They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's
	shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned
	on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge
	into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.


	82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the
	beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

	83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

	They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing
	hard and constantly looking around scared out of their
	minds.


	84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

	Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
	kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

				KILGORE
		They far enough?

				LANCE
		Sure -- fine --

	Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
	a waiting lackey.

				KILGORE
			(through megaphone)
		That's far enough -- pick one
		up and come on in --


	85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

	They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
	building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
	-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
	tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
	around frantically.


	86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

	Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
	Lance looks over at Willard.

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		Maybe he'll get tubed.

				WILLARD
		What?

				LANCE
		Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
		where -- where they can't see him.

	A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
	
				WILLARD
		Incoming !

	Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
	SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
	looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
	are HEARD.

				KILGORE
		Son of a bitch.

	Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


	87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
	on the waves.


	88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		The tragedy of this war is a
		dead surfer.

	Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
	too.

				WILLARD
		What's that?

				LANCE
		Just something I read in the
		Free Press.

				KILGORE
		They just missed a good set --
		the chicken shits !

	Lance looks up.


	89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

	They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
	hangs over the water.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
			(megaphone)
		Try it again, you little bastards.


	90  BACK TO SCENE

	He turns to Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I´m not afraid to surf this place.
		I'll surf this place.


	91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

	He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

				KILGORE
		Bring that R.T., soldier.

	He grabs it.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
		Goddamit, I want that treeline
		bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
		gimme some napalm -- son of a
		bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
		or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
		them -- just bomb 'em into the
		Stone Age, boy.

	He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
	WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Son of a bitch.

	As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
	raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
	general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
	intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
	rifle turning to Lance --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		We'll have this place cleaned up
		and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
		Don't you worry.

	He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



	92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

	A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
	The P.B.R. hangs below it.

	The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
	alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
	copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
	The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
	-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
	going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
	of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
	begin their bombing run.


	93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

	Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
	inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
	H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
	and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


	94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
	and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
	often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
	to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
	are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
	out almost everything.

				CHIEF
		Forget that extra drum -- it's
		too damn hot.

				CLEAN
		Clear on starboard -- Where's
		Lance an' the Captain?

				CHIEF
		I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
		point --

	Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		Let's just get outta here.


	95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
	smoke drifts over.

	Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
	direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
	drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
	deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
	tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
	making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
	ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
	goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
	merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

				WILLARD
			(to Lance)
		Look. There it is; the boat.

	Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
	still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
	against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
	the boat.

				LANCE
			(whispers)
		He'll kill us.

				WILLARD
		He can't kill us.
			(realizing as he says it)
		We're on his side.

	Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
	strides back without looking at them.

				KILGORE
			(almost to himself)
		You smell that.
			(louder)
		You smell that?

				LANCE
		What?

				KILGORE
		Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
		the world smells like that --

	They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; nostalgically)
		I love the smell of napalm in
		the morning. 

		One time we had a hill bombed
		for 12 hours. I walked up it
		when it was all over; we didn't
		find one of 'em ... not one
		stinking gook body. They
		slipped out in the night -- but
		the smell -- that gasoline smell
		-- the whole hill -- it smelled
		like ...
			(pause)
		victory...

	He looks off nostalgically.

				WILLARD
		You know, some day this war's
		gonna end..

				KILGORE
			(sadly)
		Yes, I know.

	Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
	hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
	them up in the air.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The wind --

				LANCE
		What?

	Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

				KILGORE
			(rising maniacally)
		Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
		blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

	He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; screaming)
		It's gonna blow this place out.
		It's gonna ruin it ...

				WILLARD
		The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

	They turn and stare out to sea.


	96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
	over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
	wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
	the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
	boards, overjoyed.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


	97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

				WILLARD
		You don't expect this kid to
		ride that crap, do you? He's
		a goddamn artist, he needs
		something to work with...

	Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

				LANCE
		Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

				KILGORE
			(apologetically)
		Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
		how you feel.

	He turns toward the trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		It's the napalm -- it's causing
		the wind -- ruining my perfect
		left.

	He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
	guards and other lackeys.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; mumbling)
		The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
		my perfect left -- my perfect
		left point break -- napalm --

	Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


	98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
	crew waiting and yelling.


	99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

				WILLARD
		Are you finished surfing?

				LANCE
		Yeah... thanks.

				WILLARD
		Want to say goodbye to the
		Colonel?

				LANCE
		Nah.

				WILLARD
		Then let's get the hell out of
		here.

	They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
	distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
	cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
	thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
	equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
	-- Willard looks at them.

				LANCE
		No -- no, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Which one's the Colonel's?

				LANCE
		The Yater -- the clear one
		with the thin stringer.

	Willard glances over to it with determination. There
	is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
	board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
		a bitch.

	The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
	toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
	surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
	Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
	a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
	board.

				WILLARD
			(calm)
		This one , Lance?

				LANCE
		Yeah, Jesus Christ !

	Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
	board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
	through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
	Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
	relieved.

				CLEAN
		What'd you that for?

				WILLARD
		When I was a kid I, never had
		a Yater spoon.

	Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
	The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
	toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
	clearly visible on the stern.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

	The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
	It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
	fire.


	101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

	They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
	fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
	banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
	against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
	Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
	from his forward turret.

				LANCE
			(yelling)
		Maybe we better stay in under
		the trees till dark -- we got
		his Yater.

				WILLARD
		He didn't look like he'd take
		that sitting down.

	They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Let's put some distance between
		us and Charlie.

	The Chief nods.

				CHIEF
		Lance ---
	
				LANCE
		Yeah.

				CHIEF
		Why don't you roll us a big
		joint? I think the Captain'd
		like that.

	They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
	pause, Willard smiles:

				WILLARD
		Take one a mine --

	He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
	cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
	up.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

	It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

	The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
	bank. The men wait tensely listening --

				LANCE
		You hear it again?

				WILLARD
		No -- I don't think so. But
		it'll be back. They were
		circling. It'll be back.

				LANCE
		You think he'd of shot us?

				WILLARD
		When?

				LANCE
		Any time -- us -- Americans.

	Lance looks over at Willard.

				WILLARD
		I don't think he´d of shot us on
		the beach but -- he'd of shot us
		if he saw me taking the board --

				LANCE
		A Yater spoon is hard to get --
		especially here.

				WILLARD
		He's a man who knows what he 
		wants -- he does know what he wants.

				CHEF
		Can I go get those mangos now?

				CHIEF
		I'll go with you in a while --
		judt hold tight awhile --

				LANCE
		Captain -- that was all true
		about the rats and chocolate
		and stuff?

				WILLARD
		Sure.

				LANCE
		And you could just tell when
		the supplies were booby trapped?

				WILLARD
		It's a feeling you get in the
		jungle. When you get good, you
		can find a track and tell not
		only how many they are, but
		their morale, how far they're
		going, whether they're near
		their camp, the weapons they're
		carrying.

				CLEAN
		How can you tell their weapons..
		an' how far they're going?

	Willard smiles.

				WILLARD
		Mostly from the imprints when they
		put them down to rest. their morale
		from the way they drag their feet,
		or the joints that may be lying
		around. If they're near a base
		camp, they wouldn't be conserving
		food; they'll be throwing it away
		half-eaten. If the branches aren't
		broken, their weapons are slung.
		But all this is just technique..
		There's a feeling you get after a
		while, that's what's important.
		I was going through a village once.
		I was looking for a certain party.
		I took off my boots, and walked
		into each hut. It was midnight.
		I went into three like that and
		suddenly I realized I´d gone into
		each hut the same way -- standing
		up -- so the next one I went in on
		my belly. An RPD burst took out
		the door a bit above my head.
			(he shrugs)
		Things like that.

	A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
	They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
	distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
	language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
	ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

		I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
		boy -- I just want the board
		back -- You can understand --
		It was one of my best -- You
		know how hard it is to get a
		board you like, boy. I'm not
		gonna hurt or harm you --
		Just leave it where I can find
		it --

	The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
	speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
	ceases.

				CLEAN
		Jesus -- that guy's too damn
		much.

				CHIEF
		I wonder if that was the same
		copter.

				WILLARD
		He's probably got 'em all over
		the river with that recording.
		We better move now while it's
		dark.

	Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

				CHIEF
		Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
		Lance with you --

				WILLARD
		I'll go with him --

	They all look at him.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I wanta get my feet on solid land
		once in awhile --

	He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


	104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

	They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

				WILLARD
		Chef.

				CHEF
		Yes, sir --

				WILLARD
		Why they call you that?

				CHEF
		Call me what, sir?

				WILLARD
		Chef -- is that 'cause you like
		mangoes an' stuff?

				CHEF
		No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
		-- I'm a sauciere --

				WILLARD
		A sauciere --
	
				CHEF
		That's right, sir -- I come from
		New Orleans -- I was raised to
		be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
		We specialize in sauces; my whole
		family. It's what we do. I was
		supposed to go to Paris and study
		at the Escoffier School; I was
		saving the money. They called
		me for my physical so I figured
		the Navy had better food.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing out here?

				CHEF
		Cook school -- that did it.

				WILLARD
		How?

				CHEF
		They lined us all up in front of
		a hundred yards of prime rib --
		magnificent meat, beautifully
		marbled.. Then they started
		throwing it in these big
		cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
		I looked in, an' it was turning
		gray. I couldn't stand it. I
		went into radio school.

	They move into a slight clearing.

				WILLARD
			(whispering)
		-- quiet --

	Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
	tures that he heard something; he points.


	105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

	PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

				WILLARD
			(silent)
		There...

	He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
	the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
	move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
	walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
	at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
	cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
	is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
	and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
	the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
	gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
	stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
	hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
	and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
	noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
	out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
	point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
	wants. He makes another command and they rush the
	trapped enemy.


	106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

	Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
	down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
	from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
	FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
	almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
	them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
	emptying their clips.

				CHEF
		It's a motherfucking tiger --
		goddamn...

	He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
	man can be.

				CHEF
			(continuing; screaming)
		Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
		motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

	Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
	the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
	out of his head as well.


	107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

	They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
	the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
	his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

				CHEF
			(hysterical)
		Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
		It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
		Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

	The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
	unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
	the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
	jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

				LANCE
		What's this tiger shit?

				WILLARD
		No shit... I think I shot the
		hell out of him.

				LANCE
		You think?

				WILLARD
		I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

				CLEAN
		Was a big tiger -- no shit?

				WILLARD
		Who stopped to measure him -- let's
		get the hell out of here.

				CHEF
		A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
		been killed.

	The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
	speed.

				CHIEF
		You forgot the mangoes, didn't
		you?

				CHEF
		Mangoes? There as a fucking
		tiger in the woods -- I could've
		been eaten alive. I'm never
		going into that jungle again.
		I gotta remember never get out of
		the boat; never get outta the boat.

	They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
	NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		He was right, the Chef -- never
		go into the jungle, unless you're
		ready to go all the way.

	108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

	Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns
	around, and we SEE his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		What was in the jungle? What was
		there, waiting for me?

	He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
	his face momentarily. There is something different about
	him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
		was it Kurtz? He was just a name
		to me now; I couldn't remember a
		face, a voice -- he just didn't
		add up to me. all his liberal
		bullshit about the end of savagery
		-- and the role of our culture,
		our way of life...

	Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --
	there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Our way of life -- I really
		started to look forward to
		meeting Kurtz again.

	114  VIEW ON WILLARD

	 Willard opens a letter from the packet.

	We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine
	writing on the envelope.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier of A Dtachment
		contained letters from the families
		and wives of Kurtz' men There
		were letters from Kurtz' wife as
		well.


	115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER

	It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner
	is the return addess of Mrs. Colonel Walter Kurtz --
	Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up
	with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year
	old American Beauty... She is classically American.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Dearest Walt -- I have to confess
		something. I know how you feel
		about this, but I had to ask Bob

		just couldn't stand it anymore,
		not knowing where you are, whether
		you're alive or dead. I'm sorry
		Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob
		didn't tell me anything -- he said
		he couldn't -- I can't stand it

		stand it.

	Willard looks out at the jungle.

	Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests
	pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		I have to take the kids to school
		every morning now -- carpools just
		never work out.

		Jeff came home with a black eye

		He wouldn't tell me what the fight

	117  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly
	and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
	a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
	the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
	addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
	written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
	ular. It reads:

					Sell the house
					Sell the car
					Sell the kids
					Find someone else
					Forget it
					I'm never coming back
					Forget it --

	Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli-
	copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that
	brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain-
	coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up.


	120  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS

	Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the
	dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass.

				WILLARD 
		Soldier -- where'´s your C.O.?

				SOLDIER
		Stepped on a booby trap, sir --
		got blown all to hell --

				WILLARD 
		Well , who's in command here?

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		Over here, Captain --

	He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a
	large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same
	clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions
	Willard into the tent.


	122  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT

	They duck inside -- it is dark and damp.

	On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the
	pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches
	out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play
	cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over 
	the situation.

				AGENT
		You came in on that boat, didn't
		you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah --

				AGENT
		Where are you headed?

				WILLARD 
		What's it matter? Get to the

		Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this

				WILLARD 
		Captain Willard -- go ahead.

				AGENT
		Look -- we got in a little trouble
		-- they rudely took our helicopter
		for MedEvac work on this -- uh
		Operation Brute Force -- They just
		brought it back this morning.

				WILLARD 
		Yeah.

				AGENT
		Well I mean like they also took
		our fuel -- We've been here two
		days.

				WILLARD 
		Dreadful.

				AGENT
		Look -- the girls could get
		killed -- we're not supposed to
		be this close combat, I mean
		real combat.

				WILLARD 
		Well --

				AGENT
		We could use some fuel -- just a
		half drum -- just enough to get
		us out a here.

				WILLARD 
		We need all our fuel.

	He turns and starts to leave.

				AGENT
		But, Captain, think what these
		girls have done for the boys --
		think of how they've risked --

	Willard is almost out of the tent.

				TERRI
		Captain --

	He turns around.

				TERRI
			(continuing)
		It's really rough here -- Captain
		-- we're just not built for it --

	The Pilot laughs.

				PILOT
		That's rich --

				TERRI
		Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
		you -- if I could --

	Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
	and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
	takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

				AGENT
		Look -- you know who that is,
		Captain -- you know what she's
		saying -- you'll never see stuff
		that good outside of a magazine
		for the rest of your life.

				WILLARD 
		I'm not that fond of blondes --
		maybe I like brunettes --

				AGENT
		Take your pick -- they all like
		you -- I can tell --

				WILLARD
		I like all of them --

				AGENT
		Good -- like I said, take your 
		pick.

				WILLARD
		I said I like all of them.

				AGENT
		Now just a second -- I'm doing
		you a favor, buddy -- what're you
		trying to pull?

	Willard turns to leave again.

				WILLARD
		We need all our fuel anyway.

				AGENT
		Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
		-- what I meant was we'd need a
		whole drum for that --

				WILLARD
		Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

	Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
	to do likewise.

				AGENT
		What's there to talk about -- this
		whole thing disgusts me.

				WILLARD
		My men --

				AGENT
		What !

				WILLARD
		That's what there is to talk 
		about -- my man -- I take a good
		care of my men --

	The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
	the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

				AGENT
		You're out of your skull --

				WILLARD
		We have a lot of pride in our

				AGENT
		How far do you think you can

	         NIGHT

	The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the
	distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations
	with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire
	burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white
	light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the
	night.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days and nights later, we
		approach the Do Lung Bridge.


	128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW

	watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
	sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
	banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
	rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
	through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
	scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
	or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
	automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
	edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
	up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

				SOLDIER
		I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
		-- I got money.

				CHIEF
		Get away from this boat.

				WILLARD
		Who's your C.O., soldier?

	The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

				SOLDIER
		Fuck you, you'll get what's coming 
		to you.

	Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps
	forward.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard?

				WILLARD
		That's me.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard -- we got these
		from Nha Thrang two days ago --
		they expected you here then --

	He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
	Willard takes it.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		You don't know how happy that makes
		me, sir.

				WILLARD
		Why?

				LIEUTENANT
		Now I can get out a here -- if
		I can find a way out.

				WILLARD
		We'll be needing some supplies
		and fuel -- do you know anybody
		who can give me a hand?

				LIEUTENANT
		I'd just clear out as soon as I
		could if I were you, sir. They're
		gonna start working on the bridge
		with torches again. Charlie will
		start throwing it in hard --

				WILLARD
		What is this bridge?

				LIEUTENANT
		It's of strategic importance for
		keeping the highway into Bat Shan
		open -- the generals don't like to
		admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

	He points to the men getting ready to work.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		Every night we build it and by
		0800 they've blown it up -- it
		and a lot of good men -- But the
		generals like to say the road is
		open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
		road except Charlie.

	He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		This is the cesspool of hell.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Incoming.

	SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
	in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

			(yelling)
		All right -- Lance, go with the
		Captain an' see what you can
		scrounge --

	Willard climbs out with Lance.

				CHIEF
			(continuing; to Willard)
		Better make it fast, sir -- we
		don't really need much anyway.

	Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
	bridge.


	129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

	They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
	on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
	don't know where to run.

	They dive towards the voice.


	130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

	They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his

				SOLDIER
		You came right to it, son of

		Son of a bitch, sir.

	The Soldier doesn't respond.

				WILLARD

		Where's your chief supply officer?

				SOLDIER
		Beverly Hills --

				WILLARD
		What?

				SOLDIER
		Straight up the road -- a concrete
		bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
		else you think he'd be?

				WILLARD
		C'mon --

	There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
	road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
	from a sandbagged emplacement.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Get your asses down, buddy.

	They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
	emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
	sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
	Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
	trips.

				VOICE
		Watch your feet, asshole --

	Willard looks down.

				VOICE
			(continuing)
		You stepped on my face.

				LANCE
		We thought you were dead.

				VOICE
		The whole world loves a smart ass.

	They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
	into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
	feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
	himself.

				WILLARD
		What're you shooting at, soldier?

				GUNNER
		Gooks.

	He turns and sees it's an officer.

				GUNNER
			(continuing)
		I´m sorry, sir.

				WILLARD
		It's all right, sergeant -- what's
		out there?

				GUNNER
		They were tryin' to cut through
		the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

				OTHER SOLDIER
		Oh yeah -- listen.

	There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
	stops for aminute then continues hideously.

				GUNNER
		He's trying to call his friends --
		send up a flare.

	The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
	light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

				SPOTTER
		Those are all dead, stupid, he's
		obviously underneath 'em --

	They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
	gets more intense.

				GUNNER
		Wake up the Roach.

	The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
	leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
	times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
	the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

				ROACH
		Yeah, man.

				SPOTTER
		Slope in the wire -- hear him.

	He listens, he does, he nods.

				SPOTTER
			(continuing)
		Bust him.

	Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
	up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
	designs all over it.

				GUNNER
		Hear him?

				ROACH
		Sure , yeah.

				GUNNER
		You need a flare --
			
				ROACH
		No, it´s cool.

	He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
	the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
	across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
	SCREAM, calculating.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		He's close -- real close.

	He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
	the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
	WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
	that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
	pieces of bodies coming down around them.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		Muhhh Fuhhh ...
	
	He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


	131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

	They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
	Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
	WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

				CHEF
		Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

	A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
	building the bridge.

				SOLDIER
		Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
		eh?

				CLEAN
		Yeah, it still runs.

				SOLDIER
		Do me a favor buddy, please.

				CLEAN
		What is it?

	He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

				SOLDIER
		Send these out when you get back
		to the world.

	He puts them in Clean's hand.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		It's to everyone I really knew --
		the first girl I screwed -- my
		brother -- best friend -- I wanted
		to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
		knowing 'em -- it's been a great
		twenty years. I gotta let 'em
		know.

				CLEAN
		What're you askin' me for -- put
		'em in the first helicopter comes
		in tomorrow.

				SOLDIER
		Nobody comes in here.

	He points up at the mountain ridges.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
		the 307th -- on that hill we
		counted fourteen different guns
		in one minute -- they got rockets
		mortars, snipers in those trees,
		there's a million of those shitty
		little bastards out there -- we're
		all gonna die.

	He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna be dead.

	Clean takes the letters.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		You got a chance in that boat --
		by morning you could be five miles
		down the river.

				CLEAN
		We ain't goin' down the river.

	The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

				CLEAN
			(continuing)
		What's up river from here anyhow --

	The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

				SOLDIER
		Spooky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie?

				SOLDIER
		No, it'd be spooky without the war
		-- give 'em back.

	He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
	disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
	carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
	M-16's.

				CHIEF
		Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

				WILLARD
		We found some bodies -- let's get
		out a here.


	132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

	They edge through the shallows as the men light up their
	welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --
	then pull away and accelerate fast.


	133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

	The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the
	distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with
	artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the
	bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

	The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
	downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
	his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
	forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
	canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
	set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


	135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

	The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
	bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

				CHIEF
			(to Willard)
		I can't see a fucking thing.

	There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
	tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
	climbs forward, and looks down.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		We hit a big enough one this
		hull will shatter like a Corvette.
		Fucking plastic boat.

	Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
	warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
	joins him, helping.

				WILLARD
			(shouting to Chief)
		What about ducking into one of
		those tributaries till this river
		slows down?

				CHIEF
		Who knows what's up there?

				WILLARD
		Can't be any worse than this.
		What do you think?

				CHIEF
		I think this river wants to take
		us home fast. I'm practically
		goin' in reverse.

	Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
	of a tributary.

				WILLARD
		Well, get in there.

				CHIEF
		This whole area is lousy with
		V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
		Lemme turn around and we'll be
		in Hau Fat in six minutes.

	There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
	really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

				WILLARD
		Get in there !

				CHIEF
		This is my crew and my fucking
		boat, and I'm the responsible
		party.

				WILLARD
		Get in there now or I'll bury
		you in this river.

	It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't
	do as he says.

				CHIEF
			(finally relents, 
			  turns the helm)
		You're fucking crazy. You're
		going to get us all killed.

	The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth
	of the tributary.

				WILLARD
		That we're dumber than we look.

	Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
	darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
	it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
	It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

	Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck
	fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is
	removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- 'bout twenty meters
		starboard.

	Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef
	cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free.

	Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD
	of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull.

	143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN


	144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

	He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
	it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
	-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
	and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
	burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

				CLEAN
		I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
		bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
		it's jammed.

	Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
	He looks angrily to Willard.

	Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
	up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
	the cockpit.

				WILLARD
		Throw me that ordnance.

	Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
	opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
	the edge of the cockpit.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Give me some kind a field a fire --

	BULLETS rip by.

				CHEF

		Oh, God --

	He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and FIRES -- there
	is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the
	jungle.


	145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

	He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.
	There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large
	tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-
	ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and
	jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.


	146  CLOSE SHOT ON THE CHIEF

	He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead.
	Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.


	147  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	149  MED. VIEW

	The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded.
	They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-
	cause they know they're too far from the banks to
	be shot at.

	They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a
	joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint
	have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces
	of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount.
	The boat is a floating wreck.

	Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack
	by Chief. All of the men are silent.

	Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the
	shoulder.

				CHEF
		There's some bad holes, man,

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Vous pouvez approcher mais

				CHEF
		Take her in slow.


	160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

	The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
	a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
	for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
	eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
	tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
	troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
	ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
	aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
	and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
	dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
	head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
	cate, with a strength about him.

				PHILIPPE
		Hands on the heads.

				CHIEF
		I can't steer with my goddamn
		feet.

				CHEF
		Hey, they speak American.

				GASTON
		Who is the commanding officer?

				CHIEF
		I --

				WILLARD
		I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
		This is Chief Warrant Officer
		Phillips -- it's his boat. We
		were shot up bad downriver and
		need repairs and food -- we can
		pay you in gold.

				GASTON
		Philippe --

	Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
	from the deck and ties it to the dock.

				LANCE
		I'll help you with --

				PHILIPPE
		Do not move --

	Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

				GASTON
		Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

				WILLARD
		As I said, we can pay you in
		gold.

				GASTON
		Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

	He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

				GASTON
		We share a common enemy -- you
		are our guests.
			(he steps back)
		I am Gaston de marais -- this is
		my family's plantation. It has
		been such for 121 years. It will
		be such after I die.
		This is my son, Philippe -- he
		has fought in Algeria and held
		the rank of Captain. And Henry
		LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
		at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
		servant, Tran Van Kac ---

	Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
	and three women come forward from different positions --
	all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		My youngest son -- Christian --


	161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

	He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of
	ammunition trailing off behind him.

	They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
	in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
	heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
	They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
	Philippe's command.

				WILLARD
		American weapons?

				GASTON
		We took them from the dead.
			(smiles)
		Now -- I assume you want to rest,
		to shower. We'll attend to your

				CHEF
		Shower.

	Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

				WILLARD
		We don't want to bother you any,
		we --

				GASTON
		A man of war is never bothered to 
		aid an ally -- you will follow me,
		Captain.

	Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
	up his M-16 by the stock.

				WILLARD
		A habit of men of war, sir --
		you understand.

				GASTON
		Of course, Captain -- an
		unfortunate necessity.

	The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
	follow.

				CHIEF
		What about the boat?

				PHILIPPE
		My men will keep it for you --

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
		boat.

				WILLARD
		Chief.
			(pause)
		Come with us.

	They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
	and follows.


	164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

	Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
	ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
	many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

				GASTON
		A suitable accomodation for
		your men, captain -- you will,
		of course, be quartered with us --

	He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
	Chief is hesitant.

				WILLARD
		Go ahead --

	Philippe leads them on, muttering.

				GASTON
		Captain, this way.

	Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
	the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
	about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
	young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
	opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
	Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Magnificent, eh, Captain?

	Willard looks.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		It is very good -- there is no
		current -- It is very good. I
		have never seen one like it in
		all Indochina. I was in Paris
		when it arrived -- do you know
		what might have caused --

				WILLARD
		Looks like a two thousand pound
		to me. Yeah, a two thousand
		pound bomb.

				GASTON
		No, I've seen those in Normandy.
		This is much better.
			(pause)
		My country -- my country could
		never originate this. Magnificent.

	Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
	looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
	amezement.


	165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

	A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
	Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
	Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
	caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
	stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
	reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

				CHEF
		A hot shower, hot damn.

	He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
	caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
	he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
	shower is.

	elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

	Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
	the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with
	its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
	battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
	burns.

	TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
	The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
	The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
	up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

				CHEF
		This food is wonderful ! I can't
		believe the chef is a slope.
		    (turning to Clean)
		Some more?

	Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
	reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

				CHEF

		Hey -- Lance.

				LANCE
		Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
		wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,

	And then he looks to his friends for approval.

	Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
	there is another, more elaborate table, where the
	De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
	through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
	group.

	The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
	Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
	next to him.

				GASTON
		Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
		better.

				ROXANNE
		Je vais bien maintenant.

				GASTON
		May I present Captain Willard?
		He is of a paratroop regiment.
		You know the difference between a
		paratrooper and a regular soldier,
		don't you , my dear?

				ROXANNE
			(smiling and taking
			  Willard's hand)
		Yes, they come from the sky.

	She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

	Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
	him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
	forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

				WILLARD
		I would like to know more about
		the .. uh, plaque...

	Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
	wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

				GASTON
		Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
			(hard)
		This is only  for this war, Captain.
		Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
		regular forces -- 15; South
		Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
		forces and otherwise.
			(pause)
		Americain -- 6. Of course, they
		were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Of course. I -- Once we make
		our repairs, we could send word,
		we could have you evacuated
		from here.

				GASTON
		Captain?

				WILLARD
		You'll get blown outta here some
		day.

				GASTON
		We will never 'evacuate', Captain
		-- this is our home. Indochina is
		ours; it has been so for a hundred
		and twenty-one years, there is
		something to say for that.

				WILLARD
		The Vietnamese think it's theirs
		-- I guess the Americans do,
		too.

				GASTON
		But we civilized it. A place
		belongs to those who bring light
		to it, don't you agree.

				WILLARD
		I always thought the French came
		here to get the rubber.

				PHILIPPE
		Excuse me, I must attend to my
		men.

	He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

				ROXANNE
		May I ask where the Captain is
		going in his little boat?

				WILLARD
		We were going upriver when we
		got caught in a storm, ma'am.

				GASTON
		Upriver? Why upriver? There is
		nothing there, only jungle.

				WILLARD
		Do you know that jungle?

				GASTON
		When I was a boy, my father would
		take me there, to hunt. There
		are a few savages, but no man
		can live there, no white man.

				WILLARD
		What about an American named
		Kurtz?

	There is a pause.

				GASTON
		We have never heard of him.

	Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
		Captain.

	Willard turns.

				WILLARD
		Good night.

	Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
	servants clear the table.

				ROXANNE
		You must realize, Captain -- we
		have lost much here -- I, my
		husband. Gaston -- his wife and
		son.

				WILLARD
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				ROXANNE
			(rising)
		Cognac?

				WILLARD
		I should be checking on the
		boat.

				ROXANNE
		The war will still be here
		tomorrow.

	She walks out of the room.

				WILLARD
			(thinking)
		I guess so.

	He follows.


	175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

	Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

				ROXANNE
		Do you miss your home, Captain?
		Have you someone there?

				WILLARD
		No. Not really.
	
		I was discharged from the army
		four years ago. I went home,
		wasted some time, bought a Mustang
		Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
		I re-upped for another tour. No,
		everything I love is here.

				ROXANNE
		Then you are like us.

	She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What will you do after the war?

				WILLARD
		I just follow my footsteps, one
		at a time, trying to answer the
		little questions and staying away
		from the big ones.

				ROXANNE
		What's a big question?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz.
			(pause)
		I know you've heard of him.

				ROXANNE
		Yes.

				WILLARD
		What did you hear?

				ROXANNE
		That strange things.. terrible
		things have occured around this
		American, Kurtz.

				WILLARD
		What things?

				ROXANNE
		Gaston would never tell me. It
		was asubject not to be spoken of,
		Captain.

				WILLARD
		Yes.

				ROXANNE
		Did you know -- deeper in the
		jungle, upriver -- there are
		savages?

				WILLARD
		I know.

				ROXANNE
		But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

	A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
	him.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What a pity, you don't drink.
		Since my husband died, there
		are so many things I must do
		alone.

	She takes a sip.

	Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
	partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
	overlooking the river.


	176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

	A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-
	ing the front of house, from the river.

				ROXANNE
			(from the sitting room)
		Are you warm, Captain?

				WILLARD
		The river is beautiful.

	In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.


	177  WILLARD'S POV.

	The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's
	Vietnamese.


	176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes
	up behind him.

				ROXANNE
		I spend hours watching that
		river from my bedroom window.
		It fascinates me.

	She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is
	kissing her.

	179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.


	180  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready
	for the long night.


	181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE

	His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then
	she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting
	room, and up the stairs.


	182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

	It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the
	door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a
	large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over
	it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --
	there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.
	He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns
	down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and
	stands there facing him.

	He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays
	down on the bed and watches him.

				ROXANNE
		I have been lonely here, Captain.

	He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is
	leaning against the wall in his reach.

							FADE OUT.


	183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

	We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently
	slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure
	kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
	night.

	Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
	scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
	into the darkness.


	184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

	Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,
	the first disappears into the thicket.


	185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
	a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
	work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
	he drags the body out of sight.


	186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears
	into the hold.


	187  NEW VIEW

	He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,
	with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his
	best work alone, and at night.

							CUT TO.


	188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

	He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
	moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
	BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
	her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

				ROXANNE
		I will fix you breakfast.

	He starts to get up.

				WILLARD
		I'm afraid I won't have time --
		I gotta --

				ROXANNE
		Whe you reach the boat you will
		find that half your fifty calibre
		stores -- a case of grenades, a
		mortar and two M-16's and a
		case of clips are being
		transfered to us by your order.

	He stops -- seemingly stunned.

				WILLARD
		So that's it.

				ROXANNE
		You may think what you wish,
		Captain, but I like you very
		much.

	She turns to go.

				WILLARD
		What if I say no.

				ROXANNE
		Then Philippe will have to kill
		all of you.

	She leaves.


	189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

	He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
	ammunition boxes.

	Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
	Chief and crew with M-16's.

				GASTON
		Two of my men deserted last
		night. It happens from time
		to time. I assume my daughter
		told you of our conditions.

				WILLARD
		Your daughter.

				CHIEF
		They taking half our ammo,
		Captain -- said it was your orders.

	He pauses for a second.

				WILLARD
		That's right -- I did.

	The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
	engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

				WILLARD
		I guess this is whAt men of war
		do -- eh?

				GASTON
		We endure, captain -- you can
		blow up the house and we will
		live in the cellar -- destroy
		that and we'll dig a hole in the
		jungle and sleep on it. Burn
		the forest and we'll hide in
		the swamp. all the while, we
		do but one thing -- clean the
		blood off our bayonets.
			(pause)
		Au revoir, Captain.


	190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

	Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.


	191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

	The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
	at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

				CHIEF
		Next time we  get in a good fire
		fight -- I'd like to know how
		she was, Captain.

	Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
	up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
	the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
	grenades.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.

				CLEAN
		What did you put in all those
		ammo boxes?

				WILLARD
		Rocks, sand -- those two men
		who deserted.

				CHIEF
		When'd you do it?

				WILLARD
		While you were sleeping.

	He lets the board drop.

	Willard moves to the back of the boat.


	192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

	The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
	and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
	the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
	just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
	speed, alert, ready for anything.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		We moved deeper and deeper into
		the jungle. It was very quiet
		there. It was like wandering on
		a prehistoric planet, an unknown
		world ... where the men thought
		they crawled to, I don't know.
		For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
		exclusively.

	Willard looks out ahead and points.

	They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
	REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


	193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE


	194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

	They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
	completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
	flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
	they once were.

				CHEF (O.S.)
		Flood.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		No -- most of 'em are still
		standing -- might've been
		disease.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		I don't know -- there'd still
		be some sign -- it's just like
		the one this morning.

	195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

	The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
	jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


	196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

	Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
	dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
	once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
	gateway to paradise.

	The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
	orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
	The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
	being.

	Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
	cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
	hell.

	Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
	The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
	hole.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	197  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN

	The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
	about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
	the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
	on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

				CHIEF
		-- All right, Lance --

	Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
	the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
	tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
	as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
	MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
	smoke clears.

				LANCE
		The other one --

				WILLARD
		No -- leave it --

				CHIEF
		Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

				WILLARD
		Thta's not Charlie's work --

	There is silence.

				WILLARD
		Whoever put'em there didn't do it
		to kill people -- They put 'em up
		as signs -- 

				CHIEF
		Signs?

				WILLARD
		Yeah -- like keep out --

	Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead
	past the smoking mound.


	198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

	The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
	swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
	an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Toward the night of the fifth
		day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
		judged ourselves about eight
		miles from Kurtz' base.
		Everything was still, the trees,
		the creepers, even the brush
		seemed like it had been changed
		into some kind of stone. It was
		unnatural, like a trance. Not
		a sound could be heard. I began
		to think I was deaf -- then the
		fog came suddenly, and I was
		blind too.

	The boat disappears in the thick fog.


	199  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

				WILLARD
		Listen.

				CHIEF
		What is it?

				WILLARD
		Listen.

	They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND
	COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of
	HUNDREDS OF MEN.

				CHIEF
		They're on the banks of the
		river.


	200  VIEW ON LANCE

	Frantically, he swings the twin fifties around.

				LANCE
		Jesus !


	201  VIEW ON CHIEF

	We can barely SEE him -- in and out of the fog.

				CHIEF
		No, Lance. Not while you can't 
		see.


	202  VIEW ON WILLARD

	listening. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING.

				CHIEF
		Will they attack?

				WILLARD
		If they have boats ... or
		canoes... they'd get lost in
		the fog. We can't move either --
		we'll end up on the shore.

				CHEF
		God...

				LANCE
		Sounds like hundreds of them.

				WILLARD
		Shhhhhh.

	The CHORUS OF GROANS in unbearable. But it is not ahostile
	cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the SOUND OF HUMAN
	ANGUISH.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		It doesn't sound hostile --
		it sounds like they've seen us
		coming and it sounds like --
		I don't know, a funeral. I
		don't understand.


	203  VIEW ON LANCE

	A glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses,
	fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	204  MED. VIEW - THE P.B.R.

	MOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds
	cautiously.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two hours after the fog lifted,
		we moved slowly to a spot we
		thought was roughly a mile and
		a half below Kurtz's camp. We
		approached a long sand-bank
		stretching down the middle of
		the river.

				CHIEF
		Which way? Right or left?

				WILLARD
		Who knows? Right.

				CHIEF
		Looks pretty shallow.

	The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef
	takes a long pole and begins sounding depth.


	205  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from
	bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard
	takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung.
	Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him.

				WILLARD
			(reading)
		Upon reaching objective. Target

		Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm --

			(pause)
		Purgative air strike ! Purgative !
		They'd kill me too !

	Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds
	and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R.
	rattling against the boat.

				CHIEF
		Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're
		shooting fucking arrows at us.


	206  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	looking toward the banks.


	207  WILLARD'S POV

	Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes
	entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of
	pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them.


	208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the
	childish assault.

				WILLARD
		Steer her right.


	209  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	arrows hitting the deck. The men open up everything
	they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly.
	
				WILLARD
		Keep going.. keep going.
		They're just fucking sticks !
		Chief, stay at the helm.

	But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
	M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
	and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
	horror.


	210  VIEW ON CHIEF

	laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him,
	bleeding onto Willard's boots. He looks up at Willard,
	about to say something.

				CHIEF
		A spear?

	He dies.


	211 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men are still crazily FIRING into the empty jungle
	long after those who attacked beat their retreat.

				WILLARD
		Stop it. Stop it !

	Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are
	absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down
	and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off.

				LANCE
		Chief's dead.

	Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot
	in his hand.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was the strangest thing --
		I don't know that I can explain
		it. Two of my men dead, and all
		I could think of was whether
		Kurtz was dead too. That's all
		I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
		Kurtz.

	He starts to wipe the blood off the boot.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Somehow, in the middle of this ...
		carnival, Kurtz had grown into
		something -- a gifted officer;
		a great man.
		Somehow, he was the only light
		in this hopeless, hopeless
		darkness.
		And now I was too late --
		he was probably gone, disappeared...
		by a grenade rolled into his
		tent -- or by some spear on the head.
		Christ, I felt like howling like
		those animals in the fog.


	212  EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT

	The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat.
	Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing
	to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on
	the edge of the party.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Here they are in Los Angeles.
		Everything is safe. There's a
		supermarket around the corner,
		the police station around the
		other. It would seem ridiculous
		to them that I was shot to hell
		because I had lost the privilege
		of listening to the mysterious
		Colonel Kurtz.

	213  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY

	The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically
	in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They
	don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.


	214  WHAT THEY SEE

	Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
	in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
	of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
	paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
	about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
	the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
	white and blue.


	215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
	voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
	The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
	hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
	wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
	Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
	positions.

				WILLARD
		Just stand here with me where
		they can see us. Do nothing.


	216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

	MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
	men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
	without weapons. The natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
	tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
	feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
	almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
	boat to penetrate.


	217  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms
	of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks
	something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
	was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


	218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

	Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping
	pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these
	faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.


	219  VIEW ON WILLARD, THE CREW

	They look up toward the bank.


	220  THEIR POV

	The temple at NU MUNG BA, a fortified encampment, built
	around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.
	Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and
	rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze
	around the fortress.

	He picks up his field glasses and looks through.


	222  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH GLASSES

	A sign entangled in the barbed wire -- its lettering
	strict and military:

				MISSION F-82
				NU MUNG BA

	The GLASSES POV MOVES REVEALING another sign written in
	a wild psychedelic hand.

				OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE NOW !

	The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an
	astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of
	colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat.
	He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving
	frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE
	OFF of him.

				AUSTRALIAN

		I know, I know, it's all right.
		Come in this way. It's mined
		over there. This way. It's

	Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
	they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
	water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
	them safely in.

	A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
	merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
	of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
	ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

				CHEF
		Charlie?

				WILLARD
		Looks that way.

		Who's he?

				WILLARD
		God knows.

	The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on
	board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat-
	tered with mud and blood.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Who the hell are you?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby. Got any Winstons?

				WILLARD
		Moonby what?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
		Australian Regiment, Task Force.
		Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

				WILLARD
		    (incredulously, indicating
			 the hundreds of natives)
		What is this?

				MOONBY
		Oh, they're simple enough people.
		It's good to see you, baby.
		Nobody has any Winstons?

	Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston.

				MOONBY
		This boat's a mess.

				WILLARD
		Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
		to him.

				MOONBY
		Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
		Kurtz.
			(he puffs, then smiles)
		You listen to him. God, these
		are good. I kept these people
		off you, you know. It wasn't
		easy.

				WILLARD
		Why did they attack us?

				MOONBY
		Simple. They don't want him to
		go.

				WILLARD
		You're Australian?

				MOONBY
		Pre-Australian, actually. But
		I'd dig goin' to California.
		I'm California dreamin'.

				WILLARD
			 (almost to himself)
		So Kurtz is alive.

				MOONBY
		Kurtz. I tell you, that man
		has enlarged my mind.

	He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
	mind's expansion.

				MOONBY
			(continuing)
		But lemme tell you, he is the
		most dangerous thing in every
		way that I've come on so far.
		He wanted to shoot me. The
		first thing he said is, 'I'm
		going to shoot you because you
		are a deserter.' I said I
		didn't desert from your army,
		I deserted from my army. He
		said, 'I'm going to shoot you
		just the same.'

				WILLARD
		Why didn't he shoot you?

				MOONBY
		I've asked myself that question.
		I said to myself, why didn't he
		shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
		because I had a stash like you
		wouldn't believe. I hid it in
		the jungle; the wealth of the
		Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
		-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
		Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
		Triangle. and Acid -- I make
		Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
		come on like piss. Now I'm
		Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
		he talks. About everything !
		Everything. I forgot there's
		such a thing as sleep. Everything.
		Of love, too.

				CHEF
		Love?

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, not what you think...
		Cosmic love. He made me see
		things -- things, you know.

	The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.


	226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES

	Men in small groups, huddled over food.
	Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There
	are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible
	shrunken heads.


	227  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Sounds like he's gone crazy.

				MOONBY
		No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
		crazy -- if you heard him talk,
		just last week, you'd never think
		he was crazy.

				WILLARD
		Is that where he is? By the 
		shrunken heads.

				MOONBY
		Those heads, yes. Well, the
		rebels...

				WILLARD
			(to his men)
		We're going ashore. Tie her up
		-- and leave your guns up, Lance.

				LANCE
		What?

				WILLARD
		Bring your rifles, that's all.
			(looking at Moonby)
		Take us to him.

				MOONBY
		Right on -- he's been waiting
		for --

				WILLARD
		And shut up.

	Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard
	and the men follow.


	228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

	As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle.

	They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
	than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
	AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
	emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
	equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
	of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
	if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of Captain Cook.

	They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
	appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
	wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
	loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
	strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
	long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
	decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
	this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

				WILLARD
		Who are you?

				MOONBY
			(breaking in)
		His name is...

				WILLARD
		I'm not ever goin' to tell you
		to shut up again.

	Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
	comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
	are to see him.

				MAN
		Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
		Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
		Walter Kurtz, commanding.

				WILLARD
		What happened here?

				COLBY
		What -- happened here.

				WILLARD
		Charlie?

				COLBY
		NVA regulars. They're coming
		again tonight. Tet -- their
		big -- assault.

	Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
	to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
	pounded him. He takes his arm.


	229  REVERSE ON COLBY

	looks at Willard, not understanding.


	230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

	Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, don´t say that.

				COLBY
		Take us back. Take us back !
		But, the operation -- the team.
		Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
		-- the team.

				WILLARD
		Take me to him, Major.

	Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

				COLBY
		I had nothing to do with these
		operations -- I did not do the
		planning -- none of us did.
		It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
		was the genius. You'll see --
		the genius of our Colonel. He
		should be made a General, don't
		you think? A General? It's...

	Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
	knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

	Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
	a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
	though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
	well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
	almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound.


	232  VIEW ON WILLARD

	This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
	automatically, he comes to an attention.

				WILLARD
		Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

				KURTZ
		I'm Kurtz.

				WILLARD
			(he salutes)
		Captain B.L. Willard reporting
		his presence, sir.


	233  VIEW ON KURTZ

	looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
	and simply:

				KURTZ
		At ease...
			(pause, as he regards him)
		Sit down.


	234  MED. VIEW

	There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
	But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
	the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
	Then Kurtz does.

	Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
	Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
	man to man, ritualistically.

				KURTZ
			(slowly)
		Why did you come to ... my province.

				WILLARD
		We were attacked -- down river.
		We need supplies and medical 
		help.

				KURTZ
		You were not coming here, to
		see me?

				WILLARD
			(finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie)
		No -- no, sir.

				KURTZ
		You came up my river -- in that
		small boat. So simple. I
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky, like
		we did.
			(pause)
		You are the final justice,
		aren't you?

				WILLARD
		What do you mean, Colonel?

				KURTZ
			(gently)
		What other reason could you
		have come? A Captain. Ranger.
		Paratrooper. Graduate of the
		Recondo School. Am I right
		about these things?

				WILLARD
		You know you're right.

	There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

				KURTZ
		Then the Agency approached you.
		Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
		Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
		for one life. Perhaps a village
		elder, or a tax collector.
		Nobody's orders but your own.
		Exciting work.


	235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He remains silent.


	236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

	He smiles.

				KURTZ
		You've spent tome at the Royal
		Tracking School of Malaysia.
		I can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied.
		I understand you, Captain. We
		understand each other.

	There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
	Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
	it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
	assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

				WILLARD
		Do you know me?

				KURTZ
		Yes.

	Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
	word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

				KURTZ
				(continuing)
		Do you know me ?

	He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
	distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.


	237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

	Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
	a primitive civilization.


	238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

	Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
	next to him. He is exhausted.

	Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
	approaches, crouches down.

				CHEF
		Captain -- they've been probed
		all this week -- Cong and NVA
		regulars. There's gonna be a
		big offense any time.

				WILLARD
		I know.

	Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

				CHEF
		What are we doing here?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
		just like he said.

				KURTZ
		Yeah, I can see that. He's 
		fuckin nuts --

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				CHEF
		He killed that guy without feeling
		anything.

				WILLARD
		Not a thing.

				CHEF
		When you kill Cong, don't you
		feel something.

				WILLARD
		Sure.
			(thinking)
		Recoil... I feel the recoil of
		my rifle.

	Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


	239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

	Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
	emplacement.

	Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
	to Willard as he passes.

				WILLARD
		This is good -- triple overlapping
		fields of fire -- walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces.

	A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
	runs off to her bunker.

	WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
	of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
	children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've done things, when I was
		alone in the jungle -- that I
		never told anyone about.

	They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
	lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond.

	Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
	Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets.

				CHEF
		This is evil -- evil, Captain.
		We're all gonna die here.

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I know.

				CHEF
		I don't get it -- You said your
		mission was to kill him. Let's
		do it, an' get our asses outta
		here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
		war; I mean, this don't look
		good for America !

				WILLARD
			(lost in his thoughts)
		... he's an amazing officer.

				CHEF
		You got to kill this sonuvabitch
		-- Lance and me, we don'´t
		understand none of this -- Jesus,
		Captain -- I don't wanna die here
		-- Do it quick.

	Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
	nods, sucking a joint.

				WILLARD
		Yeah. I know.

	He thinks.


	240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
	the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
	steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


	241  WILLARD'S VIEW

	An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
	quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
	ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
	military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
	but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

	There are other indications of the modern headquarters
	this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
	tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
	There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
	maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
	garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
	spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
	fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
	"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

	Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
	Willard.

				MOONBY
		He's asleep -- don't bother him.

				KURTZ
		I'm awake.

	Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		You. Get out.

	Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
	Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; suddenly)
		I said get the fuck out !
			(to himself)
		I'm going to kill the little
		weirdo myself tomorrow.
			(he shows some pain
			  when moving his
			  midsection)
		He´s only stayed alive this long
		because he's a good orderly and
		medic. He knows how to use a
		hypodermic.

				WILLARD
		You're gonna get hit tonight,
		bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
		regulars.

				KURTZ
		That's right, the little gook-
		pricks. But they are noble
		little gook-pricks, noble.
		Because they fight with their 
		guts, like animals. And for an
		idea ! That's rich. We fight
		with ingenious machines and
		fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
		But I'll call in a major blotto
		airstrike tonight. We'll have
		ourselves a helluva airstrike
		tonight, a lightshow. How do
		you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
		Light My Fire...'

	Willard shrugs.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Do you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I like it...

				KURTZ
		I love it.

	He rests back, grinning.

				WILLARD
		You've gone crazy.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		No. My thinking is clear.
			(calmly)
		But my soul has gone mad.

	Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
	stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
	literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

	Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
	wound.


	242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
	witnessing the proceedings inside.

				CHEF
			(muttering)
		Kill him -- come on, why don't
		you kill him


	243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
	         NIGHT

	Willard examining the wound.

				KURTZ
			(in pain)
		Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

	Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
	takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
	Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; looking
			  up in pain)
		You see how stupid it would have
		been to blow out my brains? I'm
		dying from the gut anyway.

	Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
	frightened, holds up his hand.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		No -- I don't want to sleep.
		I want to think. Water. Give
		me water.

				WILLARD
		You can't have water after
		morphine.

				KURTZ
		Still playing by the rules.
			(almost
			  affectionately)
		You're a damn good kiler.

				WILLARD
			(still holding the
			  second morphine)
		How's the pain?

				KURTZ
		How's yours?

				WILLARD
		I can handle it.

				KURTZ
		Pain is easy to handle -- but
		nobility.. the nobility of a
		man is judged by how much Truth
		he can handle.

				WILLARD
		What Truth?

				KURTZ
		The truth that you were sent
		here to murder me, ans so far
		you haven't done it. And do
		you know why?
			(looks at him)
		Yes, you know why.
			(he looks)
		Your mission makes about as much
		sense as those idiots who sent
		you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! 
		How long does it take you to
		figure out that nobody knows
		what they're doing here.
			(coldly)
		Except me.

	He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Gimme water.

				WILLARD
		No water.

				KURTZ
		You know what you're doing?
		You are interfering with my
		plans !

	He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
	him impassively.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		This water's got Moonby's acid
		in it --

	He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
	over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
		Think of it. A whole regiment
		of those shitty little Cong --
		War. Total war -- war like you've
		never known it. It's beautiful
		-- you'll love it. Trust me.


	244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT

	We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
	to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

				CHEF
		Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
		do it.

				KURTZ
		Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
		napalm on Speed, too. It's
		spectacular, you'll see.

	Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
	with Chef.


	245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
	hand.

				KURTZ
		Look into the jungle. You can't --
		it's too terrible. You have to
		smear yourself with warpaint to
		look at it -- you have to be a
		cannibal.
			(whispered)
		That's why warpaint was invented.
		Then it becomes your jungle.

	Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

				WILLARD
		How did we get here?

				KURTZ
		Because of all the things we do,
		the thing we do best -- is lie.

				WILLARD
		I think think a lie stinks.

				KURTZ
		Oh Captain, that is so true.

				WILLARD
		Stinks. I could never figure --
			(he drinks from
			  the canteen)
		I could never figure how they
		can teach boys how to bomb villages
		with napalm -- and not let them
		write the word 'fuck' on their
		airplanes.

	Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		You could never figure it because
		it doesn't make sense.

				WILLARD
		Fuck no.

				KURTZ
		I'll tell you what makes sense !
		Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !
		Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out
		of them if they don't do what
		we want.

				WILLARD
		We'll exterminate the fuckers !

	Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
	He draws his bayonet.

				CHEF
		Captain -- kill him.

				KURTZ
		Think of it -- for years, millions
		of years, savages with pathetic
		painted faces were scared shitless
		that fire would rain down from
		the sky. And goddamn, we made
		it happen. God  bless  Dow  !

				CHEF
		Kill him !

	Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
	Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
	FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.


	246  VIEW ON LANCE

	He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort
	of mindless, programmed killer.

				LANCE
			(FIRING)
		Hot damn !

	Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an
	instant of silence, then:


	247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

	The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,
	as illuminating flares light up the blackness.


	248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

	of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of
	razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted
	out to the enemy, poised to attack.


	249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

	Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-
	onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting
	speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish
	in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.


	250  EIS VIEW

	A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche-

				SOLDIER
		Wow...

	Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t
	himself.


	252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

	Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
	around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
	Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
	even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
	salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
	around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and
	purple.

	We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of
	teeth around his neck, his face painted.

	and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some
	sort of cosmic flower.


	256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

	Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a

		Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
		Mini-gun.


	262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

	A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
	operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
	BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
	loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
	stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
	7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
	the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
	geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
	as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
	blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.

				KURTZ
		Claymores, claymores.

	The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
	penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
	Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
	seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
	another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
	ing in front of us.

	The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
	trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
	LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

	Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


	265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

	through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more
	extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm
	but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They
	chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached
	the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
	Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
	weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
	ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


	266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

	The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
	Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,
	blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,
	biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
	horrible savagery.


	267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

	standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;
	he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with
	a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and
	BLASTS more as they come.


	268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

	The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that
	BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance
	opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to
	the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over.

	Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times.
	He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls
	under the enemy's feet.


	269  VIEW ON MOONBY

	madly to himself.


	270  MED. VIEW - WILLARD AT THE R.T.

	shouting into the radio

				WILLARD
		Code -- Street Gang -- Street
		Gang ! Purgative air strike;
		Street Gang !

	He turns and runs back through the compound with the
	receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.
	The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
	over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into
	them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue
	cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches 
	through metal.


	271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

	Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women
	and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-
	es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.
	The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing
	men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.


	272  VIEW ON WILLARD

	watching this spectacle.


	273  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ

	He rounds  the shadow wall.

	Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a
	machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun
	at his side and steps out.

				KURTZ
			(yelling)
		Charles !

	They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
	who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
	gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
	holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
	beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
	moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
	it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
	and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
	rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
	encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
	machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
	and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.


	274  MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ

	taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the
	wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett
	at the Alamo.


	275  FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS

	The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain
	of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.
	It is the biggest firework show in history.

	The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.
	Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the
	air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of
	MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.


	276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

	following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on
	all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
	into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
	crawling Kurtz

				KURTZ
		Go away -- hide yourself.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing?

				KURTZ
		Going back  - to the jungle to
		die.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back. You can 
		still live.

				KURTZ
		I had immense plans.

				WILLARD
		I'm gonna get you out of here.

				KURTZ
		I was on threshold of great 
		things.

	Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
	holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
	spectacle continues in the b.g.


	277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

	This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
	out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
	to get him onto the boat.


	278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

	The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
	Nu Mung Ba.

							FADE OUT.

	FADE IN.


	279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

	The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
	circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
	is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
	some Montagnards sit near them.

	Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
	they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
	field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
	Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
	f.g. below is Lance, dead.

	Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

				COLBY
		Who is he?

				WILLARD
		He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
		of this war.

							CUT TO:


	280  THE P.B.R.

	battered, moving slowly down the river.


	281  TIGHTER VIEW

	Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
	Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
	left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
	Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
	Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
	The battle is not over.

				KURTZ
		Don't. Don't frighten them away.

	Willard looks down at him.

				WILLARD
		So you understand this?

	Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
	eyes. There is a slight smile.

				KURTZ
		Do I not?


	282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

	The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

				KURTZ
		My river... my people... my jungle...
		my ideas... my country... 		
		my wife...
			(he looks at Willard)
		... my death.

				WILLARD
		You had immense plans... immense plans...

				KURTZ
		Yes...

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
	intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
	at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
	that is no more than a breath.

				KURTZ
		The horror, the horror.

	We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
	The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
	craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

				COLBY
		There.

	Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
	helicopters hooping toward them.

				COLBY
			(continuing)
		How did they know?

				WILLARD
		They must have seen the fire.

	The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
	them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

				COLBY
		They're coming to rescue us.
		They're Medevac.


	283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	He stares up at the sky.

				WILLARD
					(to himself)
		They're coming to take us back.

	Copters directly overhead.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Yeah.

				COLBY
		Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-
	proaching rescue helicopter.


	284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER

	It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
	sky.


	285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at
	the retreating American helicopters.


	286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT

	The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into
	the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		... Don't remember a lot about my
		rehabilitation... but I was sent
		back to the world before the fall
		of Saigon...


	287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

	MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

	Pause. Willard is very silent.

				WILLARD
		I never answered questions about
		Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
		unimportant papers -- but for the
		most part I saved everything.
		There were other letters, personal
		ones written earlier to his wife.
		I brought them to het. I watched
		the fall of Saigon on television
		in a bar in Alameda...


	289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
	borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

	Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
	the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
	his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
	on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
	looks back.

				WILLARD
		Hi.

	Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
	door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
	mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
	sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Come in, Captain Willard.

	He enters.


	289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

	Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

	She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Can I get anything for you?

	There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
	there in the various stages of his career.

	Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
			(continuing)
		Did you know him very well?

				WILLARD
		You get to know each other pretty
		well out there.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		And you admired him?

				WILLARD
		He was a remarkable man. It was
		impossible not to --

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Love him... Yes, it is true.
		That's the hard part for me... I
		knew him better than anyone ... I
		knew him best.

				WILLARD
		You knew him best.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		You were his friend... You must
		have been, if he had given you
		this...
			(the packet)
		If he sent you to his home. He
		was the best this country had --
		he was --

				WILLARD
		Yes, I know...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		I'll never get over it -- But
		I'll always remember him...

				WILLARD
		Both of us...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Men looked up to him...
			(she loses herself
			  in a thought)
		He died as he lived...

				WILLARD
		His death was -- yes, he died as
		he lived.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Were you with him, when...

				WILLARD
		Yes I was... He said his last
		words to me.

	Pause.


	290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
	she will ask.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		What were they?


	291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me.


	292  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	remembering that incredible day moving down the river.

	Our VIEW LOOSENS

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me what he said.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		The horror ! The horror !

				WILLARD
		He spoke of you, ma'am.

	He sits there looking at her.


	293  EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT

	The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of
	the few guests left.

	We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the
	boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie
	is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to
	Willard.

							DISSOLVE TO:


	294  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY

	the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust-

	1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

	It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
	trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

	Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
	the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
	then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
	emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
	in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
	The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
	shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
	right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

	Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
	unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
	We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
	in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
	As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
	in a paisley design.

	Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
	ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
	Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
	no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

	The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
	AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
	about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
	laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
	US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
	with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

	Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
	screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
	appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
	we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
	Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
	savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
	they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
	They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
	They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
	as they move.

	The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
	mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

	We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
	running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
	painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
	FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
	and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
	around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
	are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
	frightened.

	An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
	on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
	TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
	dead.

	OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
	Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
	stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
	with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
	and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
	and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
	bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
	electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


		MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW


	2  TITLE SEQUENCE

	The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
	growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at, like the sun itself.

	Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
	again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
	is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
	cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
	distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
	stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
	MUSIC  now.

	We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
	as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
	close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
	CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
	Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
	shapes of :


	3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

	The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

	It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
	cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
	head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
	party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint. Charlie is going on and on :

				CHARLIE
		... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

				LAWYER
		What about oil ?

				CHARLIE
		Food, oil --look, let me show you
		something. This is the economy of
		the United States in two years --

	He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		This is West Germany.
			(he draws another,
			 bigger circle)
		This is Japan.
			(another , bigger)
		This is Italy.
			(a dot)
		This is Iran.
			(a very big circle)
		And this is Saudi Arabia... In
		two years ?
			(a gigantic circle)
		Do you understand ?

				ACCOUNTANT
		What's to prevent it ?

				CHARLIE
		Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
		I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing. We can protect
		our interests.
			(pause, for a drink)
		We are still the most powerful
		nation in the world. Militarily.

	He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		You know bodyguard; he was a
		captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
		him, except he won't talk. This
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

	The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		Carries a attache case at all
		times. You know what's in it ?
			(another sip)
		An Ingram Machine pistol.

	Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
	NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

		CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
	I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
	neither should this country.			with the ridge of your

	The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
	Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
	good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The attache case has been empty
		for three years, but it makes him
		safe to think there's a machine
		pistol in it.

		I don't like automatic weapons.
		They jam.

		I saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
		How much money did the contractors
		make on the M-16 ?

	Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
	reading, flirting, drinking.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		He likes to hear stories about Nam.
		I tell him I can't; they're not
		cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
		understand.

	We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
	opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
	MOVE CLOSER.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There's no way I can tell them...
		what really happened over there.

		I wouldn't've believed it if
		someone'd told me.

	We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
	from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There was only one part that
		mattered -- for me, anyway. I
		don't even know if I remember
		all of it. I can't remember
		how it ended, exactly -- because
		when it ended I was insane.

							DISSOLVE TO :

	4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY

	A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
	shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
	Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
	WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
	by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
	shoes and sell him things.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		But I know how it started
		for me -- I was on R. and R.
		in Saigon; my first time south
		of the DMZ in three months. I
		wasn't sure, but I thought this
		guy was following me.

	Willard looks back.


	5  HIS VIEW

	an American CIVILIAN.


	6  MED. VIEW

	Willard ducks into a bar.


	7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY

	Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
	tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
	crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
	past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
	sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

	An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
	drinks and approaches Willard's table.

				CAPTAIN
		How about a drink ?

				WILLARD
		Sure, thanks.

	He sits down at the table with the drinks.

				CAPTAIN
		Winning the war by yourself.

				WILLARD
			(he calls for the waiter)
		Part.

				CAPTAIN
		Which part is that ?

				WILLARD
		My part.
			(TO THE WAITER)
		Beer, with ice and water.

	   
				CAPTAIN
		That's good gin.

				WILLARD
		I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

				CAPTAIN
		Delta ?

				WILLARD
		No.

				CAPTAIN
		North ?

				WILLARD
		Yeah. Way north.

				CAPTAIN
		What unit were you with ?

				WILLARD
		None.

				CAPTAIN
		Rangers, eh?

				WILLARD
		Sort of.

	The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
	his shoulder.

				CAPTAIN
		Were you Longe Range Recon --

				WILLARD
		No -- I worked too far north for
		LRRP.

	He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
	Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
	notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
	then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

				CAPTAIN
		That's quite an array of ribbons...

				WILLARD
		Let's talk about you.

				CAPTAIN
		I was an FO for the 25th.

				WILLARD
		Tracks ?

				CAPTAIN
		Yeah.

				WILLARD
		Fat. That's real fat.

				CAPTAIN
		Sometimes.

				WILLARD
		At least you always have enough
		water. How many gallons does
		each one of those damn things
		carry ?

				CAPTAIN
		Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

				WILLARD
		You know, I can remember once,
		getting back below the DMZ -- and
		the first Americans we ran into
		were a track squadron. I just
		couldn't believe how much water
		they had. We'd been chewing
		bamboo shoots for almost a week,
		and before that, for two weeks,
		we'd been drinking anything --
		rain water, river shit, stuff
		right out of the paddies. And
		there were these guys standing
		by their trucks spilling water
		all over. I could've killed them.
			(solemnly)
		I swear to God I would have, too,
		if ...

				CAPTAIN
		I didn't know we had units up
		there in North Vietnam.

				WILLARD
		We do.

				CAPTAIN
		How long were you up there ?

				WILLARD
		A long time.

				CAPTAIN
		A year ? Waiter another beer.

				WILLARD
		I go up on missions. Listen
		Captain, buy me all the beer
		you want, but you better tell
		that asshole over there you're
		not going to find out anymore
		about me.

	Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
	Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
	He rises and comes over to the bar.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		What do you want ?

				CIVILIAN
			(indicating the Army jeep)
		If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
		Group, we'd like you to come with
		us.

				WILLARD
		Whose orders ?

				CAPTAIN
		Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
		A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
		Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
		Nha Trang.

				WILLARD
		Who are you ?

				CIVILIAN
		The agency.

	Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
	The Civilian follows.


	8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

	A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
	wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified, concealed compound.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		They took me to some place outside
		Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
		for all operations in South East Asia.
		I'd worked for Intelligence before --

	Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
	large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
	corridor -- they enter.


	9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

	A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
	attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
	reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke.

	The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it.

				WILLARD
		Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
		reporting as ordered, sir.

				COLONEL (O.S.)
		Okay, Willard, sit down.

	Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
	and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
	him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

				COLONEL
		Have you ever seen this officer
		before, Captain Willard ?

	He points to the Major.

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		This gentleman or myself ?

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		I believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in Kontum,
		is that right ?

				WILLARD
		I am not presently disposed to
		discuss that, sir.

				MAJOR
		Very good.

	He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
	Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

				COLONEL
		You know much about about Special Forces;
		Green Berets, Captain ?

				WILLARD
		I've worked with them on occasions
		and I saw the movie , sir.

	The officer smiles at this.

				COLONEL
		Then you can appreciate Command's
		concern over their -- shall we say
		'erratic' methods of operation.
			(pause)
		I have never favored elite units,
		Captain, including your paratroopers
		or whatever. Just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesn't give him any
		priviliges in my book -- not in
		this man's army.

				MAJOR
		We didn't need 'em in Korea --
		no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
		and an M-1 Garand, none of this
		fancy crap -- no sir.

				CIVILIAN
			(stopping him)
		Major.

				COLONEL
		We have Special Forces A
		detachments all along the
		Cambodian border. Two here and
		another one here -- twelve or
		fourteen Americans -- pretty
		much on their own; they train
		and motivate Montagnard natives;
		pick their own operations. If
		they need something, they call 
		for it, and get it within
		reason. What we're concerned
		with is here.


	10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP

				COLONEL
		The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
		It was originally a larger base,
		built up along the river in an
		old Cambodian fortress.
	
		The area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years --
		but --


	11  MED VIEW

				COLONEL
		... Captain, we know something's
		going on up there -- Major --

	The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

				MAJOR
		Communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of V.C. activity,
		this is routine, expected ... but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped.

				COLONEL
		About the same time -- large numbers
		of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
		began leaving the area -- this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the Rhade
		Tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries. But what is unusual is
		that we began to find Rhade refugees
		too -- in the same sampans as the
		M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
		of V.C. They've put up with war
		for twenty years -- but something
		is driving them out.

				MAJOR
		We communicate with the base
		infrequently. What they call for
		are air strikes, immediate --
		always at night. And we don't
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on.

				WILLARD
		Who ?

				MAJOR
		You see, no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive.

				WILLARD
		Why me ?

				MAJOR
		Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
		Special Forces. We understand
		you knew him.

	He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				COLONEL
		He's commanding the detachment
		at Nu Mung Ba.

	The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
	flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
	AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
	coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
	Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
	someone dumb, except very fast.

				VOICE (ON TAPE)
		Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
		Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
		Immediate receive -- hearing
		automatic weapons fire man ...

	GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

				SECOND VOICE
		Blue Delta five
		This Big Rhine -- three
		Need that ordinance immediately
		Goddamn give it to me immediate
		Christ -- Big Rhino --
		Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

	A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
	-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
	MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
	peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

				THIRD VOICE
		This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

				MAJOR
		That's Colonel Kurtz.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		I want that napalm dropped in the
		trees -- spread it among the
		branches.

		We'll give you a flare -- an
		orange one -- bright orange.
			(STATIC)
		We'd also like some white phosporous,
		Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
		it to me.

	STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

				WILLARD
		I only met Kurtz once.

				CIVILIAN
		Would he remember you ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				COLONEL
		What was your impression of him ?

	Willard shrugs.

				CIVILIAN
		You didn't like him.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a cigarette.

	The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I thought he was a lame.

				COLONEL
		A lame ?

				WILLARD
		This is years ago, before he
		joined Special Forces, I guess.
		We had an argument.

				COLONEL
		About what ?

				WILLARD
		I don't know. He was a lame,
		that's all.

				COLONEL
		But why ?

				WILLARD
		He couldn't get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words; about why we kill.

				COLONEL
		Well, he's killing now.

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				CIVILIAN
		What does that mean ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
		believe he's capable of that.
		I just don't believe it.

				COLONEL
		It's got to be Kurtz.

				CIVILIAN
		The point is that Kurtz or
		somebody attacked a South
		Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
		days ago. Last week a Recon
		helicopter was lost in the area --
		another took heavy damage --
		direct fire from their base
		camp.

				WILLARD
		Our Recon flight ?

				CIVILIAN
		Ours.

				WILLARD
		Touchy.

				CIVILIAN
		You can see, of course, the
		implications, if any of this --
		even rumours leaked out.

				WILLARD
		You want me to clean it up --
		simple and quiet.

				CIVILIAN
		Exactly -- you'll go up the
		Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
		appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
		accident, re-establish your
		acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
		find out what's happened -- and
		why. Then terminate his command.

				WILLARD
		Terminate ?

				CIVILIAN
		Terminate with extreme prejudice.


	12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA

	A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
	divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

	A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
	This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
	armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
	military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
	dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
	M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.


	13  MED. VIEW

	We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
			
				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
		pretty much all kids, except for
		Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
		Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
		Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
		Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
		Radio Operator Second Class T.
		Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

				WILLARD
		Chief, try to keep out of where
		we're going -- Why we're goin' and
		what's gonna be the big surprise.

				CHIEF
		All right with me, I used to drive
		a taxi.

				WILLARD
		Let's go.

	The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
	and otherwise go about their work.

	The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
	the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
	twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
	on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
	to the ocean.

							DISSOLVE TO :



	14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA

	The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the
	top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another.


	15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF

	Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.
	Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The
	Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs
	back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
	stares ahead into space, swallowing.

							DISSOLVE TO :



	16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK

	The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds --
	the sea is calm again.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST

	The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

				CHIEF
		The Delta closes off to us about
		ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
		be able to pick up some supplies --
		bit I think there are only two
		points we can draw enough water
		to get into the Nung River. It's
		all Charlie's turf from there on
		out.

				WILLARD
		We're gonna have some help to
		get in the river. You know
		these waters, Chief ?

				CHIEF
		'Bout six months ago I took a man
		up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
		regular Army too. Shot himself
		in the head. I brought his body 
		back down.

				WILLARD
		Shot himself. What for ?

				CHIEF
		Beats me -- the sun was too much
		for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

	Pause, looking at Willard.


	18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

	Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
	buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
	is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
	the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
	stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

				WILLARD
		Arch light.

				CHEF
		I hate that -- Every time I hear
		that noise something terrible 
		happens.

				CHIEF
		Anybody see some smoke ?

				CLEAN
		Too far inland.

				LANCE
		There they are.

	He points up to the sky.


	19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY

	Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
	the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
	trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
		till it's too late -- don't have
		to hit you neither, concussion'll
		do it for a quarter mile or better.
		Burst your ears -- suck the air
		outta your lungs.


	20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW

	They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
	He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
	flips through the letters and other documents.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier on A detachment had
		letters from Kurtz' wife and the
		wives and families of his men.
		All asking where to send future
		mail, understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work -- None of the men had
		written home in half a year.

	Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting
	of the distant B-52 BOMBING.


	21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD

	studying, examining a report.


	22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

	Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
	as Willard reads :

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and well-disciplined
		spirit. He is a fine officer,
		combining military efficiency --
		with a broad background in the
		Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

	Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
	161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... He views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker, less
		fortunate areas in the world.

	A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
		for Special Forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns, and
		his somewhat liberal politics,
		though I can see no reason to
		deny it.

	A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
	jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
		bring a sense of Western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
		programs ...

	MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just
	a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		One day later we came to an
		advanced staging area along the
		coast. This was our last chance
		to pick up supplies before
		approaching the mouth of the
		Nung River.
		 
	The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
	ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
	tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

	Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
	helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
	advanced staging areas like the Americans.

	As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
	something.

				LANCE
		Hey.

	They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
	skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
	one another.


	24  VIEW ON THE DOCK

	The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- I want you to go with the
		Captain an' get three extra drums
		of fuel and maybe scrounge some
		more 50 caliber.

				LANCE
		Yeah -- look at those uniforms.


	25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
	pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
	airplane.

				CHIEF
		Poor bastards, have a long year
		to go.

	The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
	Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


	26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
	ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

				SERGEANT
		I don't know anything about these
		papers, sir.

				WILLARD
		They're in order -- it's perfectly
		clean -- just check with ComSec-
		Intel like I said.

				SERGEANT
		Well, you know I don't have the
		priority to do that, sir. It
		says here not to contact Com-Sec-
		Int. Who's your commanding 
		officer ?

				WILLARD
		Right now -- I am.

				SERGEANT
		Well who the hell verifies that ?

				WILLARD
		I do.

	He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

				CHIEF
		No shit -- what's all the activity
		for around here ?

				SERGEANT
		The show --

				WILLARD
		What show ?

				SERGEANT
		Big show in the parade grounds
		this noon -- some boss stuff --

				WILLARD
		This -- Bob Hope or the like --

				SERGEANT
		No sir, I think -- this'll be a
		little bit different --

				CHIEF
		Where's it gonna be ?

	He points --


	27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

	A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
	surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
	garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

							DISSOLVE TO :


	28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
	wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
	of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
	the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
	see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
	surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
	or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
	the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
	this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
	lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
	herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
	armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


	29 FORWARD AREA

	jammed in the crowd

				CHEF
		It's really too much -- I mean
		I've collected every picture of
		her since she was Miss December.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- you can really get hung
		up on them like the cat in the
		Delta.

				CHIEF
		What cat  ?

				CLEAN
		One that went up for murder -- he
		was an Army Sergeant.

				CHIEF
		I never heard about that.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
		mag, man -- I mean like he was there
		when it arrived -- He just knew.

				CHEF
		So what happened ?

				CLEAN
		He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
		and had one a them little cocky
		gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
		the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
		one day, sat on the end of the dock,
		and wouldn't give it back.

				CHEF
		Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

				CLEAN
		Then went too far -- he sat
		there and starts mutilating the
		centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
		all that. Sergeant says, don't do
		her like that. You leave your
		shitty little hands off that girl.
		Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
		Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
		do that again. You'll wish you
		hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
		his iron to rock and roll and gave
		the little zero a long burst
		through the Playboy mag. Man, it
		blew him clean off the dock --
		Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
		there all full of holes.

				CHIEF
		They nail him for it bad ?

				CLEAN
		He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
		give him no medals or nothing --

	In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
	MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
	All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
	On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
	Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
	copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
	step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
	abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
	is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
	but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man.

	He walks over to the microphone.

				AGENT
		I'd like to say hello from all of
		us up here, to all of you out there.
		All of you who've worked so hard
		during Operation Brute Force --
		Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
		-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
		And I want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is. To prove it -- we've brought
		some entertainment we think you're
		gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
		and her two runners up !

	He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
	"Suzy Q."


	30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

	VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner -- smiling.

	The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
	look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
	cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness.

	Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
	their need increases by the square.


	31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

	They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
	wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
	-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
	which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
	then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
	Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
	Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

	Such are the ways of war.

							CUT TO:


	32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

	The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
	There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no
	boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
		nothing but us and the coastline.
		I felt like I had set off for
		the center of the earth...

	Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

				CHIEF
		Smoke !

				WILLARD
		Where ?

	They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


	33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

	A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

				WILLARD
		Black smoke ... secondary burning.

	The Chief grabs field glasses.

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- fishing village --
		helicopters over there. Hueys,
		lots of 'em.

				WILLARD
		First Air Cavalry. They're the
		ones gonna get us into the River.


	34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

	A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
	trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
	-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
	surf.


	35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

	They wade through the water to the beach where they are
	met by a heavily armed group of men.

	Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
	out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

	We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
	Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


	36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
	machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
	side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
	a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
	pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
	from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
	strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
	neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
	-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

	He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
	is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
	walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
	His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
		back about a hundred yards -- give
		me some room to breathe.

	A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.


	37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He was not quite prepared for this.


	38  VIEW ON KILGORE

	turning to his GUARDS

				KILGORE
		Bring me some cards.

				GUARD
		Sir ?

				KILGORE
		Body cards, you damn fool --
		cards !

	The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
	packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
	soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
	well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
	about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
	up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

				WILLARD
			(formally)
		Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
		Recon Group -- I carry priority
		papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
		11 Corp -- I believe you understand
		the nature of my mission.

				KILGORE
			(not looking up)
		Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
		expect you -- we'll see what we
		can do. Just stay out of my way
		till this is done, Captain.

	He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
	deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
	right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
	others follow,


	39  TRACKING VIEW

	The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
	devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
	comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
	it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
		Isn't one worth a Jack in this
		whole place.

	The Colonel goes on about this business.


	40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

	moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

	On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
	something to him. He stops.

				KILGORE
		What ? Here. You sure?

	The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
	the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
	young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
	Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's your name, sailor ?

		Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
		L. Johnson, sir.

				KILGORE
		Lance Johnson? The surfer?

				LANCE
		That's right, sir.

	Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

				KILGORE
		It's an honor to meet you Lance.
		I've admired your nose-riding for
		years -- I like your cutback, too.
		I think you have the best cutback
		there is.

				LANCE
		Thank you, sir.

				KILGORE
		You can cut out the sir, Lance --
		I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
		foot.


	41 VIEW ON WILLARD

	His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
	background.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
		This is Mike from San Diego and
		Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
		solid surfers -- none of us are
		anywhere near your class, though.

	Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

				WILLARD
		My orders are from Com-Sec
		Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

				KILGORE
		Just hold up a second, Captain --
		I'll get to you soon enough --
		We've got things to do here.

	Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
	Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
	discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we do a lot of surfing around
		here. Like to finish up operations
		early and fly down to Vung Tau for
		the evening glass. Have you ever
		surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
		liked the beach breaks around Na
		Trang a lot -- good lefts.

	He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
	bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we keep three boards in my
		Command Huey at all times. You
		never can tell when you're gonna
		run into something good. I got a
		guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
		a swell two days in advance. We
		try to work it in.

	He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
	has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
	horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
		one.

	He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


	42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

	We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
	Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
	has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
	it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

				KILGORE
		Where've you been riding, Lance?

				LANCE
		I haven't surfed since I got here.

				KILGORE
		That's terrible -- we'll change 
		that -- I'd like to see you work --
		I've always liked your cutback;
		got a hell of a left turn, too.

	43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

	Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by
	a table set up in front of the command copter.

	Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
	drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
	BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell you wanna go up
		to Nu Mung Ba for?

				WILLARD
		I got bored in Saigon.

				KILGORE
		What's the furthest you been
		in?

				WILLARD
		Haiphong.

				KILGORE
		Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

				WILLARD
		No. Walked.

				KILGORE
		What'd you do for supplies?

				WILLARD
			(he shrugs)
		Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
		they put out caches.

				KILGORE
		Can you trust them?

				WILLARD
		No. They put out two or three
		for every one I needed. When
		you get to the one you'll use,
		you just stake it out. If
		something feels wrong, you just
		pass it up. On one mission, I
		had to pass up three and ended
		up living on rats and chocolate
		 bars.

				KILGORE
		Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
		Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
		detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

				WILLARD
		When did you hear?

				KILGORE
		'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
		still alive?

				WILLARD
		Who knows.

				KILGORE
		Seems to me he got himself
		fragged. i heard some grunt
		rolled a grenade in his tent.
		Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
		remarkable officer. Walter
		Kurtz woulda been a General
		some day. General of the Army.
		Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
		of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		Don't you agree?

				WILLARD
		He musta changed !
			(pointing to the map)
		I got to get into the Nung
		River, here or here.

				KILGORE
		That village you're pointing at
		is kinda hairy.

				WILLARD
		Hairy ?

				KILGORE
		I mean it's hairy -- they got some
		pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
		I've lost a few recon ships in
		there now and again.

				WILLARD
		So? I heard you had a good bunch
		of killers here.

				KILGORE
		And I don't intend to get some of
		them chewed up just to get your
		tub put in the mouth of the
		goddman Nung River. You say you
		don't know Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		You talk like him. I don't
		mind taking casualties,
		Captain, but I like to keep
		my ratio ten to one in this
		unit -- ten Cong to one.

				WILLARD
		You'll find enough Cong up there.

				KILGORE
		What about this point here?

	He puts his finger on the map.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's the name of that goddamn
		village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
		names all sound the same.

	He motions to one of his surfers.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Mike, you know anything about
		the point at Vin Drip Drop?

				MIKE
		Boss left.

				KILGORE
		What do you mean?

				MIKE
		It's really long left slide,
		breaks on the short side of the
		point -- catches a south swell.

				LANCE
		Nice.

	Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell didn't you tell me
		about that place -- a good left.
			(to Willard)
		There aren't any good left slides
		in this whole, shitty country.
		It's all goddamn beach break.

				MIKE
		It's hairy ,though. That's
		where we lost McDonnel -- they
		shot the hell out of us. It's
		Charlie's point.

				KILGORE
		How big it is?

				MIKE
		Six to eight feet.

	Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		A six-foot left.

	Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

				LANCE
		Boss. What's the wind like.

				MIKE
		Light off shore -- really hollow.

				WILLARD
		We could go in tomorrow at dawn
		-- there's always off-shore wind
		in the morning.

				CHIEF
		The draft of that river might be
		too shallow on the point.

				KILGORE
		Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
		lay it down like a baby, right
		where you want it. This is the
		Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
		take that point and hold it as
		long as I like -- and you can
		get anywhere you want up that
		river that suits you, Captain.
		Hell, a six foot left.
			(he turns to an advisor)
		You take a gunship back to division
		-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
		him pick out a board, and bring me
		my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

				TOM
		I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

				KILGORE
			(hard)
		What is it?

				TOM
		Well, I mean it's hairy in there
		-- it's Charlie's point.

	Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

				WILLARD
		Charlie don't surf.


	44  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS - DAWN

	What seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors
	churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st

	CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the

	And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited
	very few of them really scared -- they fondle their

	50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

	Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch

				KILGORE
			(to Willard)
		We'll come in low out of the rising

		Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares

	Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being
	unloaded. We SEE bunkers with N.V.A. regulars ambling
	about.

	Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;

	from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere
	there is activity to prepare for the defense of the

	60  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	POV behind lead gunship. They ROAR in over the beach
	streaming FIRE from doors, pods and nose -- The ground

	61  MED. SHOT - ANTI-AIRCRAFT EMPLACEMENT

	EXPLOSIONS crash around -- the MUSIC and SOUND of the

		Fine... fine... little higher.
		Through the roof; yeah, that's

				LIEUTENANT
		You didn't tell me to, sir.

	Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass
	SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore
	is thrown down where he hangs on.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

				WILLARD
		Automatic weapons flashes along

				KILGORE
		Hold it, boy.

	He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings
	back inside.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Take her up to 300 feet,
		Lieutenant.

	They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for
	all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who
	steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's
	harness.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Rifle.

	A hand passes him a M-16.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; hard)
		My rifle, soldier.

	There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300
	Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl
	inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and
	opens the bolt.


	71  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Amazed at these proceedings.


	72  VIEW ON KILGORE

	as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets

	73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

	He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.
	The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him

	74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes
	careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.

				SOLDIER  (O.S.)
		That's 27, sir.

	trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at
	point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut
	down.


	77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

	Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-
	field. He has the R.T.

	He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak
	to Lance.

				KILGORE
		The L.Z.'s cooling off fast --
		we'll move in another company
		an' then we'll own it.
			(he laughs to himself)
		Charlie's point.

	He looks out toward the ocean.

		Good swell.

				LANCE
		What, sir?

				KILGORE
		I said it's a good swell -- hell
		of a good swell 'bout six feet.
		Let's get a look at it.

	Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.


	78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

	The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply
	and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low
	over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up
	green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up
	at the last minute as the wave breaks.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

	Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.
	regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is
	DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round
	SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a
	southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.
	Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
	emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
	Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
	The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM
	over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another
	Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The
	doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and
	out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter
	are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the
	P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.


	80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore
	stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A
	SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

				SOLDIER
		Incoming !

	They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set
	-- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards
	away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is
	unmoved.

				KILGORE
		Look at that.

	They look.

				LANCE
		This  L.Z. is still pretty hot,
		sir, maybe we oughta stand
		somewhere else.

	Kilgore pays him no mention.

				WILLARD
		I'm waiting for the fucking boat,
		Colonel.

				KILGORE
			(without looking)
		It'll get here, soldier.

	He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the
	sand.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Change.

				MIKE
		Wh -- what?

				KILGORE
		Change -- get out there -- I
		want'a see if it's ridable --
		change.

				MIKE
		It's still pretty hairy, sir.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		You want'a surf, soldier?

	He nods yes meakly.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		That's good, boy, because it's
		either surf or fight.

	They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from
	one of the guards. They all think he's going to
	shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
		all.

	He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
	Colonel walks over.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		You think that section on the
		 point is ridable, Lance?

				LANCE
		I think we ought to wait for
		the tide to come in.

	A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except
	for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the
	air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

				KILGORE
		Doesn't happen for six hours.

	Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto
	his helmet.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The tide -- doesn't come in for
		six hours.

	81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

	They walk through shallows carrying brightly
	colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM
	overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by
	carrying out wounded.

	They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's
	shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned
	on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge
	into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.


	82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the
	beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

	83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

	They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing
	hard and constantly looking around scared out of their
	minds.


	84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

	Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
	kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

				KILGORE
		They far enough?

				LANCE
		Sure -- fine --

	Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
	a waiting lackey.

				KILGORE
			(through megaphone)
		That's far enough -- pick one
		up and come on in --


	85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

	They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
	building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
	-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
	tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
	around frantically.


	86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

	Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
	Lance looks over at Willard.

		What?

				LANCE
		Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
		where -- where they can't see him.

	A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
	
				WILLARD
		Incoming !

	Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
	SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
	looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
	are HEARD.

				KILGORE
		Son of a bitch.

	Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


	87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
	on the waves.


	88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

				LANCE

		The tragedy of this war is a

	Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
	too.

				WILLARD
		What's that?

				LANCE
		Just something I read in the
		Free Press.

				KILGORE
		They just missed a good set --
		the chicken shits !

	Lance looks up.


	89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

	They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
	hangs over the water.

				KILGORE (O.S.)

		Try it again, you little bastards.


	90  BACK TO SCENE

	He turns to Willard.

				KILGORE

		I´m not afraid to surf this place.
		I'll surf this place.


	91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

	He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

			(continuing)
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
		Goddamit, I want that treeline
		bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
		gimme some napalm -- son of a
		bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
		or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
		them -- just bomb 'em into the
		Stone Age, boy.

	He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
	WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Son of a bitch.

	As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
	raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
	general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
	intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
	rifle turning to Lance --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		We'll have this place cleaned up
		and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
		Don't you worry.

	He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



	92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

	A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
	The P.B.R. hangs below it.

	The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
	alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
	copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
	The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
	-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
	going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
	of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
	begin their bombing run.


	93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

	Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
	inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
	H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
	and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


	94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
	and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
	often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
	to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
	are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
	out almost everything.

				CHIEF
		Forget that extra drum -- it's
		too damn hot.

				CLEAN
		Clear on starboard -- Where's
		Lance an' the Captain?

				CHIEF
		I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
		point --

	Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		Let's just get outta here.


	95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
	smoke drifts over.

	Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
	direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
	drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
	deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
	tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
	making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
	ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
	goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
	merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

				WILLARD
			(to Lance)
		Look. There it is; the boat.

	Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
	still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
	against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
	the boat.

				LANCE
			(whispers)
		He'll kill us.

				WILLARD
		He can't kill us.
			(realizing as he says it)
		We're on his side.

	Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
	strides back without looking at them.

				KILGORE
			(almost to himself)
		You smell that.
			(louder)
		You smell that?

				LANCE
		What?

				KILGORE
		Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
		the world smells like that --

	They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; nostalgically)
		I love the smell of napalm in
		the morning. 

		One time we had a hill bombed
		for 12 hours. I walked up it
		when it was all over; we didn't
		find one of 'em ... not one
		stinking gook body. They
		slipped out in the night -- but
		the smell -- that gasoline smell
		-- the whole hill -- it smelled
		like ...
			(pause)
		victory...

	He looks off nostalgically.

				WILLARD
		You know, some day this war's
		gonna end..

				KILGORE
			(sadly)
		Yes, I know.

	Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
	hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
	them up in the air.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The wind --

				LANCE
		What?

	Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

				KILGORE
			(rising maniacally)
		Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
		blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

	He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; screaming)
		It's gonna blow this place out.
		It's gonna ruin it ...

				WILLARD
		The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

	They turn and stare out to sea.


	96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
	over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
	wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
	the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
	boards, overjoyed.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


	97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

				WILLARD
		You don't expect this kid to
		ride that crap, do you? He's
		a goddamn artist, he needs
		something to work with...

	Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

				LANCE
		Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

				KILGORE
			(apologetically)
		Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
		how you feel.

	He turns toward the trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		It's the napalm -- it's causing
		the wind -- ruining my perfect
		left.

	He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
	guards and other lackeys.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; mumbling)
		The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
		my perfect left -- my perfect
		left point break -- napalm --

	Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


	98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
	crew waiting and yelling.


	99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

				WILLARD
		Are you finished surfing?

				LANCE
		Yeah... thanks.

				WILLARD
		Want to say goodbye to the
		Colonel?

				LANCE
		Nah.

				WILLARD
		Then let's get the hell out of
		here.

	They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
	distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
	cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
	thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
	equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
	-- Willard looks at them.

				LANCE
		No -- no, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Which one's the Colonel's?

				LANCE
		The Yater -- the clear one
		with the thin stringer.

	Willard glances over to it with determination. There
	is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
	board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
		a bitch.

	The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
	toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
	surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
	Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
	a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
	board.

				WILLARD
			(calm)
		This one , Lance?

				LANCE
		Yeah, Jesus Christ !

	Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
	board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
	through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
	Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
	relieved.

				CLEAN
		What'd you that for?

				WILLARD
		When I was a kid I, never had
		a Yater spoon.

	Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
	The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
	toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
	clearly visible on the stern.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

	The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
	It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
	fire.


	101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

	They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
	fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
	banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
	against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
	Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
	from his forward turret.

				LANCE
			(yelling)
		Maybe we better stay in under
		the trees till dark -- we got
		his Yater.

				WILLARD
		He didn't look like he'd take
		that sitting down.

	They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Let's put some distance between
		us and Charlie.

	The Chief nods.

				CHIEF
		Lance ---
	
				LANCE
		Yeah.

				CHIEF
		Why don't you roll us a big
		joint? I think the Captain'd
		like that.

	They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
	pause, Willard smiles:

				WILLARD
		Take one a mine --

	He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
	cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
	up.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

	It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

	The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
	bank. The men wait tensely listening --

				LANCE
		You hear it again?

				WILLARD
		No -- I don't think so. But
		it'll be back. They were
		circling. It'll be back.

				LANCE
		You think he'd of shot us?

				WILLARD
		When?

				LANCE
		Any time -- us -- Americans.

	Lance looks over at Willard.

				WILLARD
		I don't think he´d of shot us on
		the beach but -- he'd of shot us
		if he saw me taking the board --

				LANCE
		A Yater spoon is hard to get --
		especially here.

				WILLARD
		He's a man who knows what he 
		wants -- he does know what he wants.

				CHEF
		Can I go get those mangos now?

				CHIEF
		I'll go with you in a while --
		judt hold tight awhile --

				LANCE
		Captain -- that was all true
		about the rats and chocolate
		and stuff?

				WILLARD
		Sure.

				LANCE
		And you could just tell when
		the supplies were booby trapped?

				WILLARD
		It's a feeling you get in the
		jungle. When you get good, you
		can find a track and tell not
		only how many they are, but
		their morale, how far they're
		going, whether they're near
		their camp, the weapons they're
		carrying.

				CLEAN
		How can you tell their weapons..
		an' how far they're going?

	Willard smiles.

				WILLARD
		Mostly from the imprints when they
		put them down to rest. their morale
		from the way they drag their feet,
		or the joints that may be lying
		around. If they're near a base
		camp, they wouldn't be conserving
		food; they'll be throwing it away
		half-eaten. If the branches aren't
		broken, their weapons are slung.
		But all this is just technique..
		There's a feeling you get after a
		while, that's what's important.
		I was going through a village once.
		I was looking for a certain party.
		I took off my boots, and walked
		into each hut. It was midnight.
		I went into three like that and
		suddenly I realized I´d gone into
		each hut the same way -- standing
		up -- so the next one I went in on
		my belly. An RPD burst took out
		the door a bit above my head.
			(he shrugs)
		Things like that.

	A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
	They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
	distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
	language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
	ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

				KILGORE (V.O.)
			(over a loudspeaker)
		I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
		boy -- I just want the board
		back -- You can understand --
		It was one of my best -- You
		know how hard it is to get a
		board you like, boy. I'm not
		gonna hurt or harm you --
		Just leave it where I can find
		it --

	The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
	speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
	ceases.

				CLEAN
		Jesus -- that guy's too damn
		much.

				CHIEF
		I wonder if that was the same
		copter.

				WILLARD
		He's probably got 'em all over
		the river with that recording.
		We better move now while it's
		dark.

	Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

				CHIEF
		Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
		Lance with you --

				WILLARD
		I'll go with him --

	They all look at him.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I wanta get my feet on solid land
		once in awhile --

	He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


	104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

	They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

				WILLARD
		Chef.

				CHEF
		Yes, sir --

				WILLARD
		Why they call you that?

				CHEF
		Call me what, sir?

				WILLARD
		Chef -- is that 'cause you like
		mangoes an' stuff?

				CHEF
		No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
		-- I'm a sauciere --

				WILLARD
		A sauciere --
	
				CHEF
		That's right, sir -- I come from
		New Orleans -- I was raised to
		be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
		We specialize in sauces; my whole
		family. It's what we do. I was
		supposed to go to Paris and study
		at the Escoffier School; I was
		saving the money. They called
		me for my physical so I figured
		the Navy had better food.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing out here?

				CHEF
		Cook school -- that did it.

				WILLARD
		How?

				CHEF
		They lined us all up in front of
		a hundred yards of prime rib --
		magnificent meat, beautifully
		marbled.. Then they started
		throwing it in these big
		cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
		I looked in, an' it was turning
		gray. I couldn't stand it. I
		went into radio school.

	They move into a slight clearing.

				WILLARD
			(whispering)
		-- quiet --

	Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
	tures that he heard something; he points.


	105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

	PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

				WILLARD
			(silent)
		There...

	He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
	the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
	move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
	walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
	at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
	cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
	is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
	and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
	the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
	gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
	stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
	hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
	and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
	noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
	out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
	point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
	wants. He makes another command and they rush the
	trapped enemy.


	106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

	Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
	down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
	from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
	FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
	almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
	them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
	emptying their clips.

				CHEF
		It's a motherfucking tiger --
		goddamn...

	He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
	man can be.

				CHEF
			(continuing; screaming)
		Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
		motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

	Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
	the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
	out of his head as well.


	107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

	They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
	the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
	his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

				CHEF
			(hysterical)
		Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
		It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
		Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

	The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
	unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
	the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
	jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

				LANCE
		What's this tiger shit?

				WILLARD
		No shit... I think I shot the
		hell out of him.

				LANCE
		You think?

				WILLARD
		I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

				CLEAN
		Was a big tiger -- no shit?

				WILLARD
		Who stopped to measure him -- let's
		get the hell out of here.

				CHEF
		A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
		been killed.

	The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
	speed.

				CHIEF
		You forgot the mangoes, didn't
		you?

				CHEF
		Mangoes? There as a fucking
		tiger in the woods -- I could've
		been eaten alive. I'm never
		going into that jungle again.
		I gotta remember never get out of
		the boat; never get outta the boat.

	They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
	NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		He was right, the Chef -- never
		go into the jungle, unless you're
		ready to go all the way.

	108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

	Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns
	around, and we SEE his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		What was in the jungle? What was
		there, waiting for me?

	He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
	his face momentarily. There is something different about
	him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
		was it Kurtz? He was just a name
		to me now; I couldn't remember a
		face, a voice -- he just didn't
		add up to me. all his liberal
		bullshit about the end of savagery
		-- and the role of our culture,
		our way of life...

	Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --
	there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Our way of life -- I really
		started to look forward to
		meeting Kurtz again.

	114  VIEW ON WILLARD

	 Willard opens a letter from the packet.

	We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine
	writing on the envelope.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier of A Dtachment
		contained letters from the families
		and wives of Kurtz' men There
		were letters from Kurtz' wife as
		well.


	115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER

	It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner

	Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests
	pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g.

				WILLARD (V.O.)

	and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
	a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
	the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
	addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
	written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
	ular. It reads:

					Sell the house
					Sell the car
					Sell the kids
					Find someone else
					Forget it
					I'm never coming back

		killed -- we're not supposed to
		be this close combat, I mean
		real combat.

				WILLARD 
		Well --

				AGENT
		We could use some fuel -- just a
		half drum -- just enough to get
		us out a here.

				WILLARD 
		We need all our fuel.

	He turns and starts to leave.

				AGENT
		But, Captain, think what these
		girls have done for the boys --
		think of how they've risked --

	Willard is almost out of the tent.

				TERRI
		Captain --

	He turns around.

				TERRI
			(continuing)
		It's really rough here -- Captain
		-- we're just not built for it --

	The Pilot laughs.

				PILOT
		That's rich --

				TERRI
		Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
		you -- if I could --

	Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
	and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
	takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

				AGENT
		Look -- you know who that is,
		Captain -- you know what she's
		saying -- you'll never see stuff
		that good outside of a magazine
		for the rest of your life.

				WILLARD 
		I'm not that fond of blondes --
		maybe I like brunettes --

				AGENT
		Take your pick -- they all like
		you -- I can tell --

				WILLARD
		I like all of them --

				AGENT
		Good -- like I said, take your 
		pick.

				WILLARD
		I said I like all of them.

				AGENT
		Now just a second -- I'm doing
		you a favor, buddy -- what're you
		trying to pull?

	Willard turns to leave again.

				WILLARD
		We need all our fuel anyway.

				AGENT
		Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
		-- what I meant was we'd need a
		whole drum for that --

				WILLARD
		Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

	Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
	to do likewise.

				AGENT
		What's there to talk about -- this
		whole thing disgusts me.

				WILLARD
		My men --

				AGENT
		What !

				WILLARD
		That's what there is to talk 
		about -- my man -- I take a good
		care of my men --

	The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
	the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

				AGENT
		You're out of your skull --

				WILLARD
		We have a lot of pride in our
		unit --

				AGENT
		How far do you think you can
		push -- what kind of people do
		you think --

				WILLARD
		Esprit de corps --
	
				AGENT
		No -- absolutely not --

				WILLARD
		One for all -- all for one --

				AGENT
		You can keep your fucking fuel --

	Willard gets up.

				WILLARD
		You make some of your closest
		friends in the army -- war has a
		way of bringing men together.

				AGENT
		Get out --

				WILLARD
		Men of all races -- nationalities --

	He gets up and starts out.

				AGENT
		Two drums --

	Willard turns around slowly.

				AGENT
			(continuing)
		Two whole drums --

				WILLARD
		We can use some fifty caliber and
		a 16 too --

				AGENT
		I don't know what you're talking
		about -- Get fucked --

				WILLARD
		I will -- I assure you that --
		You got a fifty on that H-34 --
		leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll
		get my men to bring the first drum
		with 'em --

	He turns to go under the tent flap.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Have the girls freshen up a bit --
		comb their hair -- put on
		something -- you know what I mean --

	He leaves.


	123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning
	it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16.

				CLEAN
		You keep this thing in this
		condition an' it's gonna jam,
		Lance -- mark my words.

				LANCE
		Why don't you go pet the water
		buffaloes -- get off my back.

	Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes
	eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle
	brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their
	sides the words have been stenciled in black:
			
				1 Each --
				Buffalo, Water B-1A
				U.S. Army No. 15239

	Willard walks through them down to the boat.

				CHIEF
		Careful,  Captain, they've been
		known to charge.

				WILLARD
		All right I got a little surprise
		for you --

	They all look up.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've arranged with those people
		we saw at Hau Fat to give us some
		50 caliber in trade for a couple
		a drums of fuel --

				CHEF
		No shit.

				WILLARD
		Chef -- since you're such a fan
		of Miss December's I think you
		should be detailed with Lance and
		Clean to take the first drum up
		there.

				CHEF
		I don't believe you --

				CHIEF

				WILLARD
		You'll see soon enough -- get going,

				CHIEF
		No shit -- hot damn --

				LANCE
		Well -- uh thanks -- see you around.

				CATHY
		Yeah.

	The SHOE CLANGS off his helmet.

							CUT TO:


	127  EXT. THE P.B.R. APPROACHING DO LUNG BRIDGE - FULL SHOT -
	         NIGHT

	The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the
	distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations
	with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire
	burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white
	light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the
	night.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days and nights later, we
		approach the Do Lung Bridge.


	128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW

	watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
	sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
	banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
	rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
	through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
	scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
	or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
	automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
	edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
	up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

				SOLDIER
		I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
		-- I got money.

				CHIEF
		Get away from this boat.

				WILLARD
		Who's your C.O., soldier?

	The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

				SOLDIER
		Fuck you, you'll get what's coming 
		to you.

	Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps
	forward.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard?

				WILLARD
		That's me.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard -- we got these
		from Nha Thrang two days ago --
		they expected you here then --

	He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
	Willard takes it.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		You don't know how happy that makes
		me, sir.

				WILLARD
		Why?

				LIEUTENANT
		Now I can get out a here -- if
		I can find a way out.

				WILLARD
		We'll be needing some supplies
		and fuel -- do you know anybody
		who can give me a hand?

				LIEUTENANT
		I'd just clear out as soon as I
		could if I were you, sir. They're
		gonna start working on the bridge
		with torches again. Charlie will
		start throwing it in hard --

				WILLARD
		What is this bridge?

				LIEUTENANT
		It's of strategic importance for
		keeping the highway into Bat Shan
		open -- the generals don't like to
		admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

	He points to the men getting ready to work.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		Every night we build it and by
		0800 they've blown it up -- it
		and a lot of good men -- But the
		generals like to say the road is
		open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
		road except Charlie.

	He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		This is the cesspool of hell.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Incoming.

	SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
	in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

				CHIEF
			(yelling)
		All right -- Lance, go with the
		Captain an' see what you can
		scrounge --

	Willard climbs out with Lance.

				CHIEF
			(continuing; to Willard)
		Better make it fast, sir -- we
		don't really need much anyway.

	Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
	bridge.


	129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

	They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
	on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
	don't know where to run.

				VOICE
		Straight ahead, son of a bitch.

	They dive towards the voice.


	130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

	They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his
	buddy who is crying uncontrollably.

				SOLDIER
		You came right to it, son of
		a bitch --

				WILLARD
		Son of a bitch, sir.

	The Soldier doesn't respond.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Where's your chief supply officer?

				SOLDIER
		Beverly Hills --

				WILLARD
		What?

				SOLDIER
		Straight up the road -- a concrete
		bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
		else you think he'd be?

				WILLARD
		C'mon --

	There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
	road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
	from a sandbagged emplacement.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Get your asses down, buddy.

	They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
	emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
	sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
	Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
	trips.

				VOICE
		Watch your feet, asshole --

	Willard looks down.

				VOICE
			(continuing)
		You stepped on my face.

				LANCE
		We thought you were dead.

				VOICE
		The whole world loves a smart ass.

	They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
	into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
	feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
	himself.

				WILLARD
		What're you shooting at, soldier?

				GUNNER
		Gooks.

	He turns and sees it's an officer.

				GUNNER
			(continuing)
		I´m sorry, sir.

				WILLARD
		It's all right, sergeant -- what's
		out there?

				GUNNER
		They were tryin' to cut through
		the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

				OTHER SOLDIER
		Oh yeah -- listen.

	There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
	stops for aminute then continues hideously.

				GUNNER
		He's trying to call his friends --
		send up a flare.

	The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
	light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

				SPOTTER
		Those are all dead, stupid, he's
		obviously underneath 'em --

	They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
	gets more intense.

				GUNNER
		Wake up the Roach.

	The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
	leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
	times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
	the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

				ROACH
		Yeah, man.

				SPOTTER
		Slope in the wire -- hear him.

	He listens, he does, he nods.

				SPOTTER
			(continuing)
		Bust him.

	Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
	up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
	designs all over it.

				GUNNER
		Hear him?

				ROACH
		Sure , yeah.

				GUNNER
		You need a flare --
			
				ROACH
		No, it´s cool.

	He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
	the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
	across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
	SCREAM, calculating.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		He's close -- real close.

	He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
	the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
	WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
	that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
	pieces of bodies coming down around them.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		Muhhh Fuhhh ...
	
	He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


	131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

	They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
	Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
	WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

				CHEF
		Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

	A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
	building the bridge.

				SOLDIER
		Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
		eh?

				CLEAN
		Yeah, it still runs.

				SOLDIER
		Do me a favor buddy, please.

				CLEAN
		What is it?

	He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

				SOLDIER
		Send these out when you get back
		to the world.

	He puts them in Clean's hand.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		It's to everyone I really knew --
		the first girl I screwed -- my
		brother -- best friend -- I wanted
		to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
		knowing 'em -- it's been a great
		twenty years. I gotta let 'em
		know.

				CLEAN
		What're you askin' me for -- put
		'em in the first helicopter comes
		in tomorrow.

				SOLDIER
		Nobody comes in here.

	He points up at the mountain ridges.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
		the 307th -- on that hill we
		counted fourteen different guns
		in one minute -- they got rockets
		mortars, snipers in those trees,
		there's a million of those shitty
		little bastards out there -- we're
		all gonna die.

	He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna be dead.

	Clean takes the letters.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		You got a chance in that boat --
		by morning you could be five miles
		down the river.

				CLEAN
		We ain't goin' down the river.

	The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

				CLEAN
			(continuing)
		What's up river from here anyhow --

	The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

				SOLDIER
		Spooky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie?

				SOLDIER
		No, it'd be spooky without the war
		-- give 'em back.

	He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
	disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
	carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
	M-16's.

				CHIEF
		Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

				WILLARD
		We found some bodies -- let's get
		out a here.


	132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

	They edge through the shallows as the men light up their
	welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --
	then pull away and accelerate fast.


	133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

	The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the
	distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with
	artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the
	bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

	The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
	downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
	his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
	forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
	canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
	set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


	135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

	The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
	bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

				CHIEF
			(to Willard)
		I can't see a fucking thing.

	There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
	tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
	climbs forward, and looks down.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		We hit a big enough one this
		hull will shatter like a Corvette.
		Fucking plastic boat.

	Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
	warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
	joins him, helping.

				WILLARD
			(shouting to Chief)
		What about ducking into one of
		those tributaries till this river
		slows down?

				CHIEF
		Who knows what's up there?

				WILLARD
		Can't be any worse than this.
		What do you think?

				CHIEF
		I think this river wants to take
		us home fast. I'm practically
		goin' in reverse.

	Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
	of a tributary.

				WILLARD
		Well, get in there.

				CHIEF
		This whole area is lousy with
		V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
		Lemme turn around and we'll be
		in Hau Fat in six minutes.

	There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
	really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

				WILLARD
		Get in there !

				CHIEF
		This is my crew and my fucking
		boat, and I'm the responsible
		party.

				WILLARD
		Get in there now or I'll bury
		you in this river.

	It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't
	do as he says.

				CHIEF
			(finally relents, 
			  turns the helm)
		You're fucking crazy. You're
		going to get us all killed.

	The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth
	of the tributary.

				WILLARD
		That we're dumber than we look.

	Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
	darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
	it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
	It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

	Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck
	fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is
	removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

	143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN


	144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

	He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
	it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
	-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
	and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
	burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

				CLEAN
		I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
		bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
		it's jammed.

	Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
	He looks angrily to Willard.

	Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
	up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
	the cockpit.

				WILLARD
		Throw me that ordnance.

	Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
	opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
	the edge of the cockpit.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Give me some kind a field a fire --

	BULLETS rip by.

				CHEF

		We're through.

		Oh, God --

	is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the
	jungle.


	145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

	He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.
	There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large
	tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-
	ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and
	jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.

	Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.

	They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-

	The boat is a floating wreck.

	Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack

	They all look over.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		That's a light down there --

				CHEF
		Yeah, it is.

				CHIEF
		What the hell is it?

				WILLARD
		In the middle of the jungle --
		a goddamn light.


	153  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. - THE TWILIGHT

	The P.B.R. approaches the distant light -- which seems
	to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building.


	154  VIEW ON WILLARD, CHIEF

	straining to see; he uses field glasses.


	155  POV - THROUGH THE GLASSES

	Seems to be some figures standing on the dock. The
	figures pull back behind some drums.


	156  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Watch it !

	They duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the
	water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns
	trained on the dock as the boat still approaches.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		They're not Cong.

				CHIEF
			(over the loud-hailer)
		We're Americans.

	Another BURST, closer.

				CHEF
		Maybe you shouldn't say we're
		Americans?

	Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure
	it out.

				WILLARD
		Chef, try your French.

	Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:

				CHEF
		Nous sommes Americains --

	Silence.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser.


	157  VIEW ON WILLARD

	He looks through the glasses.


	158  POV THROUGH THE GLASSES

	Gradually, a small group appears from behind the drums
	on the dock.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		French Nationals -- they may not
		be too friendly, though.


	159  BACK TO SCENE

	We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying
	speaking French.

				CHEF
		Nous sommes Americains -- nous
		sommes des amis --

	There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then:

				FRENCHMAN
			(shouting out)
		Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
		espanole.

				CHEF
			(to himself)
		I thought it was pretty good,
		myself.

				CHIEF
		What'd he say?

				CHEF
		Said I speak French like a
		Spanish cow.

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Laisser tomber vos armes --

				CHEF
		Put the guns straight up -- stand
		away from the mounts.

				WILLARD
		Do it.

	They do.

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Vous pouvez approcher mais
		doucement --

				CHEF
		Take her in slow.


	160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

	The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
	a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
	for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
	eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
	tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
	troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
	ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
	aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
	and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
	dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
	head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
	cate, with a strength about him.

				PHILIPPE
		Hands on the heads.

				CHIEF
		I can't steer with my goddamn
		feet.

				CHEF
		Hey, they speak American.

				GASTON
		Who is the commanding officer?

				CHIEF
		I --

				WILLARD
		I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
		This is Chief Warrant Officer
		Phillips -- it's his boat. We
		were shot up bad downriver and
		need repairs and food -- we can
		pay you in gold.

				GASTON
		Philippe --

	Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
	from the deck and ties it to the dock.

				LANCE
		I'll help you with --

				PHILIPPE
		Do not move --

	Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

				GASTON
		Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

				WILLARD
		As I said, we can pay you in
		gold.

				GASTON
		Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

	He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

				GASTON
		We share a common enemy -- you
		are our guests.
			(he steps back)
		I am Gaston de marais -- this is
		my family's plantation. It has
		been such for 121 years. It will
		be such after I die.
		This is my son, Philippe -- he
		has fought in Algeria and held
		the rank of Captain. And Henry
		LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
		at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
		servant, Tran Van Kac ---

	Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
	and three women come forward from different positions --
	all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		My youngest son -- Christian --


	161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

	He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of
	ammunition trailing off behind him.

				GASTON
		Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie --

	A tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an
	M-16.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		And my youngest daughter --
		Claudine.


	162  CLOSE ON CLAUDINE

	an attractive girl about eighteen. She wears a red
	paratrooper beret and a well-fitted bush suit. She carries
	an M-79 grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition.


	163  FULL VIEW - P.B.R. - CREW, GASTON, OTHERS

	They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
	in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
	heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
	They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
	Philippe's command.

				WILLARD
		American weapons?

				GASTON
		We took them from the dead.
			(smiles)
		Now -- I assume you want to rest,
		to shower. We'll attend to your
		repairs after dinner.

				CHEF
		Shower.

	Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

				WILLARD
		We don't want to bother you any,
		we --

				GASTON
		A man of war is never bothered to 
		aid an ally -- you will follow me,
		Captain.

	Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
	up his M-16 by the stock.

				WILLARD
		A habit of men of war, sir --
		you understand.

				GASTON
		Of course, Captain -- an
		unfortunate necessity.

	The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
	follow.

				CHIEF
		What about the boat?

				PHILIPPE
		My men will keep it for you --

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
		boat.

				WILLARD
		Chief.
			(pause)
		Come with us.

	They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
	and follows.


	164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

	Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
	ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
	many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

				GASTON
		A suitable accomodation for
		your men, captain -- you will,
		of course, be quartered with us --

	He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
	Chief is hesitant.

				WILLARD
		Go ahead --

	Philippe leads them on, muttering.

				GASTON
		Captain, this way.

	Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
	the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
	about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
	young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
	opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
	Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Magnificent, eh, Captain?

	Willard looks.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		It is very good -- there is no
		current -- It is very good. I
		have never seen one like it in
		all Indochina. I was in Paris
		when it arrived -- do you know
		what might have caused --

				WILLARD
		Looks like a two thousand pound
		to me. Yeah, a two thousand
		pound bomb.

				GASTON
		No, I've seen those in Normandy.
		This is much better.
			(pause)
		My country -- my country could
		never originate this. Magnificent.

	Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
	looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
	amezement.


	165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

	A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
	Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
	Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
	caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
	stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
	reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

				CHEF
		A hot shower, hot damn.

	He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
	caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
	he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
	shower is.


	166  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING

	battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese
	guard at the boat.


	167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING

	A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still
	elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

	Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
	the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with
	its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
	battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
	burns.

	He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above
	which is a large mirror. There is an album on the
	marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.


	168  VIEW ON WILLARD

	haggard, looking down at the album.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I wondered -- how long has this room
		been like this; how long has the
		furniture been standing in these
		places?


	169  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

	Some old photographs of people standing around a car
	in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture
	shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the
	plantation.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Was it like this sixty years ago?
		Eighty years? But here, even
		eighty years is nothing.

	He turns the page,

	The plantation being built. Pictures of the framing,
	skeletal against the sky and jungle.


	170  VIEW ON WILLARD

	fascinated

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was jungle, once; and it will
		be jungle, again...


	171  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

	Onlu the very beginnings of the house; the first struc-
	tures. Then another picture of the jungle site where
	it was to be built.


	172  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish
	mirror. He barely recognizes himself.


	173  MED. VIEW

	Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out-
	of-time room.


	174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT

	TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
	The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
	The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
	up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

				CHEF
		This food is wonderful ! I can't
		believe the chef is a slope.
		    (turning to Clean)
		Some more?

	Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
	reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Hey -- Lance.

				LANCE
		Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
		wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,
		please.

	And then he looks to his friends for approval.

	Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
	there is another, more elaborate table, where the
	De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
	through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
	group.

	The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
	Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
	next to him.

				GASTON
		Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
		better.

				ROXANNE
		Je vais bien maintenant.

				GASTON
		May I present Captain Willard?
		He is of a paratroop regiment.
		You know the difference between a
		paratrooper and a regular soldier,
		don't you , my dear?

				ROXANNE
			(smiling and taking
			  Willard's hand)
		Yes, they come from the sky.

	She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

	Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
	him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
	forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

				WILLARD
		I would like to know more about
		the .. uh, plaque...

	Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
	wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

				GASTON
		Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
			(hard)
		This is only  for this war, Captain.
		Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
		regular forces -- 15; South
		Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
		forces and otherwise.
			(pause)
		Americain -- 6. Of course, they
		were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Of course. I -- Once we make
		our repairs, we could send word,
		we could have you evacuated
		from here.

				GASTON
		Captain?

				WILLARD
		You'll get blown outta here some
		day.

				GASTON
		We will never 'evacuate', Captain
		-- this is our home. Indochina is
		ours; it has been so for a hundred
		and twenty-one years, there is
		something to say for that.

				WILLARD
		The Vietnamese think it's theirs
		-- I guess the Americans do,
		too.

				GASTON
		But we civilized it. A place
		belongs to those who bring light
		to it, don't you agree.

				WILLARD
		I always thought the French came
		here to get the rubber.

				PHILIPPE
		Excuse me, I must attend to my
		men.

	He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

				ROXANNE
		May I ask where the Captain is
		going in his little boat?

				WILLARD
		We were going upriver when we
		got caught in a storm, ma'am.

				GASTON
		Upriver? Why upriver? There is
		nothing there, only jungle.

				WILLARD
		Do you know that jungle?

				GASTON
		When I was a boy, my father would
		take me there, to hunt. There
		are a few savages, but no man
		can live there, no white man.

				WILLARD
		What about an American named
		Kurtz?

	There is a pause.

				GASTON
		We have never heard of him.

	Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
		Captain.

	Willard turns.

				WILLARD
		Good night.

	Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
	servants clear the table.

				ROXANNE
		You must realize, Captain -- we
		have lost much here -- I, my
		husband. Gaston -- his wife and
		son.

				WILLARD
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				ROXANNE
			(rising)
		Cognac?

				WILLARD
		I should be checking on the
		boat.

				ROXANNE
		The war will still be here
		tomorrow.

	She walks out of the room.

				WILLARD
			(thinking)
		I guess so.

	He follows.


	175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

	Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

				ROXANNE
		Do you miss your home, Captain?
		Have you someone there?

				WILLARD
		No. Not really.
	
		I was discharged from the army
		four years ago. I went home,
		wasted some time, bought a Mustang
		Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
		I re-upped for another tour. No,
		everything I love is here.

				ROXANNE
		Then you are like us.

	She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What will you do after the war?

				WILLARD
		I just follow my footsteps, one
		at a time, trying to answer the
		little questions and staying away
		from the big ones.

				ROXANNE
		What's a big question?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz.
			(pause)
		I know you've heard of him.

				ROXANNE
		Yes.

				WILLARD
		What did you hear?

				ROXANNE
		That strange things.. terrible
		things have occured around this
		American, Kurtz.

				WILLARD
		What things?

				ROXANNE
		Gaston would never tell me. It
		was asubject not to be spoken of,
		Captain.

				WILLARD
		Yes.

				ROXANNE
		Did you know -- deeper in the
		jungle, upriver -- there are
		savages?

				WILLARD
		I know.

				ROXANNE
		But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

	A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
	him.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What a pity, you don't drink.
		Since my husband died, there
		are so many things I must do
		alone.

	She takes a sip.

	Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
	partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
	overlooking the river.


	176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

	A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-
	ing the front of house, from the river.

				ROXANNE
			(from the sitting room)
		Are you warm, Captain?

				WILLARD
		The river is beautiful.

	In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.


	177  WILLARD'S POV.

	The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's
	Vietnamese.


	176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes
	up behind him.

				ROXANNE
		I spend hours watching that
		river from my bedroom window.
		It fascinates me.

	She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is
	kissing her.

	179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.


	180  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready
	for the long night.


	181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE

	His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then
	she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting
	room, and up the stairs.


	182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

	It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the
	door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a
	large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over
	it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --
	there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.
	He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns
	down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and
	stands there facing him.

	He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays
	down on the bed and watches him.

				ROXANNE
		I have been lonely here, Captain.

	He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is
	leaning against the wall in his reach.

							FADE OUT.


	183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

	We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently
	slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure
	kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
	night.

	Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
	scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
	into the darkness.


	184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

	Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,
	the first disappears into the thicket.


	185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
	a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
	work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
	he drags the body out of sight.


	186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears
	into the hold.


	187  NEW VIEW

	He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,
	with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his
	best work alone, and at night.

							CUT TO.


	188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

	He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
	moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
	BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
	her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

				ROXANNE
		I will fix you breakfast.

	He starts to get up.

				WILLARD
		I'm afraid I won't have time --
		I gotta --

				ROXANNE
		Whe you reach the boat you will
		find that half your fifty calibre
		stores -- a case of grenades, a
		mortar and two M-16's and a
		case of clips are being
		transfered to us by your order.

	He stops -- seemingly stunned.

				WILLARD
		So that's it.

				ROXANNE
		You may think what you wish,
		Captain, but I like you very
		much.

	She turns to go.

				WILLARD
		What if I say no.

				ROXANNE
		Then Philippe will have to kill
		all of you.

	She leaves.


	189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

	He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
	ammunition boxes.

	Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
	Chief and crew with M-16's.

				GASTON
		Two of my men deserted last
		night. It happens from time
		to time. I assume my daughter
		told you of our conditions.

				WILLARD
		Your daughter.

				CHIEF
		They taking half our ammo,
		Captain -- said it was your orders.

	He pauses for a second.

				WILLARD
		That's right -- I did.

	The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
	engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

				WILLARD
		I guess this is whAt men of war
		do -- eh?

				GASTON
		We endure, captain -- you can
		blow up the house and we will
		live in the cellar -- destroy
		that and we'll dig a hole in the
		jungle and sleep on it. Burn
		the forest and we'll hide in
		the swamp. all the while, we
		do but one thing -- clean the
		blood off our bayonets.
			(pause)
		Au revoir, Captain.


	190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

	Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.


	191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

	The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
	at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

				CHIEF
		Next time we  get in a good fire
		fight -- I'd like to know how
		she was, Captain.

	Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
	up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
	the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
	grenades.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.

				CLEAN
		What did you put in all those
		ammo boxes?

				WILLARD
		Rocks, sand -- those two men
		who deserted.

				CHIEF
		When'd you do it?

				WILLARD
		While you were sleeping.

	He lets the board drop.

	Willard moves to the back of the boat.


	192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

	The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
	and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
	the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
	just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
	speed, alert, ready for anything.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		We moved deeper and deeper into
		the jungle. It was very quiet
		there. It was like wandering on
		a prehistoric planet, an unknown
		world ... where the men thought
		they crawled to, I don't know.
		For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
		exclusively.

	Willard looks out ahead and points.

	They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
	REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


	193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE


	194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

	They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
	completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
	flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
	they once were.

				CHEF (O.S.)
		Flood.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		No -- most of 'em are still
		standing -- might've been
		disease.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		I don't know -- there'd still
		be some sign -- it's just like
		the one this morning.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

	The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
	jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


	196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

	Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
	dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
	once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
	gateway to paradise.

	The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
	orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
	The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
	being.

	Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
	cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
	hell.

	Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
	The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
	hole.

	197  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN

	The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
	about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
	the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
	on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

				CHIEF
		-- All right, Lance --

	Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
	the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
	tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
	as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
	MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
	smoke clears.

				LANCE
		The other one --

				WILLARD
		No -- leave it --

				CHIEF
		Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

				WILLARD
		Thta's not Charlie's work --

	There is silence.

				WILLARD
		Whoever put'em there didn't do it
		to kill people -- They put 'em up
		as signs -- 

				CHIEF
		Signs?

				WILLARD
		Yeah -- like keep out --

	Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead
	past the smoking mound.


	198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

	The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
	swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
	an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Toward the night of the fifth
		day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
		judged ourselves about eight
		miles from Kurtz' base.
		Everything was still, the trees,
		the creepers, even the brush
		seemed like it had been changed
		into some kind of stone. It was
		unnatural, like a trance. Not
		a sound could be heard. I began
		to think I was deaf -- then the
		fog came suddenly, and I was
		blind too.

	The boat disappears in the thick fog.


	199  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

				WILLARD
		Listen.

				CHIEF
		What is it?

				WILLARD
		Listen.

	They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND
	COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of
	HUNDREDS OF MEN.

				CHIEF
		They're on the banks of the
		river.

	Frantically, he swings the twin fifties around.

				LANCE

	201  VIEW ON CHIEF

	We can barely SEE him -- in and out of the fog.

				CHIEF
		No, Lance. Not while you can't 
		see.


	202  VIEW ON WILLARD

	listening. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING.

				CHIEF
		Will they attack?

				WILLARD
		If they have boats ... or
		canoes... they'd get lost in
		the fog. We can't move either --
		we'll end up on the shore.

				CHEF
		God...

				LANCE
		Sounds like hundreds of them.

				WILLARD
		Shhhhhh.

	The CHORUS OF GROANS in unbearable. But it is not ahostile
	cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the SOUND OF HUMAN
	ANGUISH.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		It doesn't sound hostile --
		it sounds like they've seen us
		coming and it sounds like --
		I don't know, a funeral. I
		don't understand.


	203  VIEW ON LANCE

	A glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses,
	fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R.

	204  MED. VIEW - THE P.B.R.

	MOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds
	cautiously.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two hours after the fog lifted,
		we moved slowly to a spot we
		thought was roughly a mile and
		a half below Kurtz's camp. We
		approached a long sand-bank
		stretching down the middle of
		the river.

				CHIEF
		Which way? Right or left?

				WILLARD
		Who knows? Right.

				CHIEF
		Looks pretty shallow.

	The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef
	takes a long pole and begins sounding depth.


	205  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from
	bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard
	takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung.
	Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him.

				WILLARD
			(reading)
		Upon reaching objective. Target
		key personnel and commence
		operation. Should difficulty

		impossible, break radio silence
		Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm --
		indicate purgative air strike --

			(pause)
		Purgative air strike ! Purgative !
		They'd kill me too !

	Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds
	and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R.
	rattling against the boat.

				CHIEF
		Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're
		shooting fucking arrows at us.


	206  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	looking toward the banks.


	207  WILLARD'S POV

	Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes
	entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of
	pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them.


	208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the
	childish assault.

				WILLARD
		Steer her right.


	209  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	arrows hitting the deck. The men open up everything
	they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly.
	
				WILLARD
		Keep going.. keep going.
		They're just fucking sticks !
		Chief, stay at the helm.

	But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
	M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
	and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
	horror.


	210  VIEW ON CHIEF

	laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him,
	bleeding onto Willard's boots. He looks up at Willard,
	about to say something.

				CHIEF
		A spear?

	He dies.


	211 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men are still crazily FIRING into the empty jungle
	long after those who attacked beat their retreat.

				WILLARD
		Stop it. Stop it !

	Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are
	absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down
	and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off.

				LANCE
		Chief's dead.

	Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot
	in his hand.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was the strangest thing --
		I don't know that I can explain
		it. Two of my men dead, and all
		I could think of was whether
		Kurtz was dead too. That's all
		I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
		Kurtz.

	He starts to wipe the blood off the boot.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Somehow, in the middle of this ...
		carnival, Kurtz had grown into
		something -- a gifted officer;
		a great man.
		Somehow, he was the only light
		in this hopeless, hopeless
		darkness.
		And now I was too late --
		he was probably gone, disappeared...
		by a grenade rolled into his
		tent -- or by some spear on the head.
		Christ, I felt like howling like
		those animals in the fog.


	212  EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT

	The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat.
	Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing
	to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on
	the edge of the party.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Here they are in Los Angeles.
		Everything is safe. There's a
		supermarket around the corner,
		the police station around the
		other. It would seem ridiculous
		to them that I was shot to hell
		because I had lost the privilege
		of listening to the mysterious
		Colonel Kurtz.
			(pause)
		Of course I was wrong. He was
		waiting for me. Kurtz was alive
		and he was waiting for me.

	213  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY

	The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically
	in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They
	don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.


	214  WHAT THEY SEE

	Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
	in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
	of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
	paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
	about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
	the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
	white and blue.


	215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
	voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
	The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
	hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
	wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
	Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
	positions.

				WILLARD
		Just stand here with me where
		they can see us. Do nothing.


	216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

	MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
	men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
	without weapons. The natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
	tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
	feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
	almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
	boat to penetrate.


	217  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms
	of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks
	something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
	was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


	218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

	Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping
	pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these
	faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.


	219  VIEW ON WILLARD, THE CREW

	They look up toward the bank.


	220  THEIR POV

	The temple at NU MUNG BA, a fortified encampment, built
	around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.
	Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and
	rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze
	around the fortress.


	221  VIEW ON WILLARD

	He picks up his field glasses and looks through.


	222  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH GLASSES

	A sign entangled in the barbed wire -- its lettering
	strict and military:

				FOURTH SPECIAL FORCES
				MISSION F-82
				NU MUNG BA

	The GLASSES POV MOVES REVEALING another sign written in
	a wild psychedelic hand.

				OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE NOW !

	The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an
	astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of
	colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat.
	He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving
	frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE
	OFF of him.


	223  VIEW ON WILLARD

	not believing what he's just seen.


	224  THE GLASSES POV

	Once again the young black man is now waving his
	Australian hat.


	225  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Willard shouts out to the starnge greeter.

				WILLARD
		We've been attacked.

				AUSTRALIAN
			(shouting back)
		I know, I know, it's all right.
		Come in this way. It's mined
		over there. This way. It's
		all right.

	Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
	they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
	water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
	them safely in.

	A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
	merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
	of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
	ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

				CHEF
		Charlie?

				WILLARD
		Looks that way.

				CHEF
			(looking at the Australian)
		Who's he?

				WILLARD
		God knows.

	The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on
	board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat-
	tered with mud and blood.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Who the hell are you?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby. Got any Winstons?

				WILLARD
		Moonby what?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
		Australian Regiment, Task Force.
		Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

				WILLARD
		    (incredulously, indicating
			 the hundreds of natives)
		What is this?

				MOONBY
		Oh, they're simple enough people.
		It's good to see you, baby.
		Nobody has any Winstons?

	Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston.

				MOONBY
		This boat's a mess.

				WILLARD
		Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
		to him.

				MOONBY
		Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
		Kurtz.
			(he puffs, then smiles)
		You listen to him. God, these
		are good. I kept these people
		off you, you know. It wasn't
		easy.

				WILLARD
		Why did they attack us?

				MOONBY
		Simple. They don't want him to
		go.

				WILLARD
		You're Australian?

				MOONBY
		Pre-Australian, actually. But
		I'd dig goin' to California.
		I'm California dreamin'.

				WILLARD
			 (almost to himself)
		So Kurtz is alive.

				MOONBY
		Kurtz. I tell you, that man
		has enlarged my mind.

	He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
	mind's expansion.

				MOONBY
			(continuing)
		But lemme tell you, he is the
		most dangerous thing in every
		way that I've come on so far.
		He wanted to shoot me. The
		first thing he said is, 'I'm
		going to shoot you because you
		are a deserter.' I said I
		didn't desert from your army,
		I deserted from my army. He
		said, 'I'm going to shoot you
		just the same.'

				WILLARD
		Why didn't he shoot you?

				MOONBY
		I've asked myself that question.
		I said to myself, why didn't he
		shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
		because I had a stash like you
		wouldn't believe. I hid it in
		the jungle; the wealth of the
		Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
		-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
		Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
		Triangle. and Acid -- I make
		Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
		come on like piss. Now I'm
		Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
		he talks. About everything !
		Everything. I forgot there's
		such a thing as sleep. Everything.
		Of love, too.

				CHEF
		Love?

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, not what you think...
		Cosmic love. He made me see
		things -- things, you know.

	The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.


	226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES

	Men in small groups, huddled over food.
	Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There
	are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible
	shrunken heads.


	227  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Sounds like he's gone crazy.

				MOONBY
		No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
		crazy -- if you heard him talk,
		just last week, you'd never think
		he was crazy.

				WILLARD
		Is that where he is? By the 
		shrunken heads.

				MOONBY
		Those heads, yes. Well, the
		rebels...

				WILLARD
			(to his men)
		We're going ashore. Tie her up
		-- and leave your guns up, Lance.

				LANCE
		What?

				WILLARD
		Bring your rifles, that's all.
			(looking at Moonby)
		Take us to him.

				MOONBY
		Right on -- he's been waiting
		for --

				WILLARD
		And shut up.

	Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard
	and the men follow.


	228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

	As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle.

	They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
	than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
	AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
	emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
	equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
	of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
	if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of Captain Cook.

	They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
	appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
	wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
	loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
	strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
	long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
	decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
	this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

				WILLARD
		Who are you?

				MOONBY
			(breaking in)
		His name is...

				WILLARD
		I'm not ever goin' to tell you
		to shut up again.

	Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
	comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
	are to see him.

				MAN
		Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
		Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
		Walter Kurtz, commanding.

				WILLARD
		What happened here?

				COLBY
		What -- happened here.

				WILLARD
		Charlie?

				COLBY
		NVA regulars. They're coming
		again tonight. Tet -- their
		big -- assault.

	Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
	to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
	pounded him. He takes his arm.


	229  REVERSE ON COLBY

	looks at Willard, not understanding.


	230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

	Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, don´t say that.

				COLBY
		Take us back. Take us back !
		But, the operation -- the team.
		Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
		-- the team.

				WILLARD
		Take me to him, Major.

	Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

				COLBY
		I had nothing to do with these
		operations -- I did not do the
		planning -- none of us did.
		It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
		was the genius. You'll see --
		the genius of our Colonel. He
		should be made a General, don't
		you think? A General? It's...

	Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
	knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

	Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
	a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
	though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
	well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
	almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound.


	232  VIEW ON WILLARD

	This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
	automatically, he comes to an attention.

				WILLARD
		Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

				KURTZ
		I'm Kurtz.

				WILLARD
			(he salutes)
		Captain B.L. Willard reporting
		his presence, sir.


	233  VIEW ON KURTZ

	looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
	and simply:

				KURTZ
		At ease...
			(pause, as he regards him)
		Sit down.


	234  MED. VIEW

	There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
	But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
	the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
	Then Kurtz does.

	Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
	Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
	man to man, ritualistically.

				KURTZ
			(slowly)
		Why did you come to ... my province.

				WILLARD
		We were attacked -- down river.
		We need supplies and medical 
		help.

				KURTZ
		You were not coming here, to
		see me?

				WILLARD
			(finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie)
		No -- no, sir.

				KURTZ
		You came up my river -- in that
		small boat. So simple. I
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky, like
		we did.
			(pause)
		You are the final justice,
		aren't you?

				WILLARD
		What do you mean, Colonel?

				KURTZ
			(gently)
		What other reason could you
		have come? A Captain. Ranger.
		Paratrooper. Graduate of the
		Recondo School. Am I right
		about these things?

				WILLARD
		You know you're right.

	There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

				KURTZ
		Then the Agency approached you.
		Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
		Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
		for one life. Perhaps a village
		elder, or a tax collector.
		Nobody's orders but your own.
		Exciting work.


	235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He remains silent.


	236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

	He smiles.

				KURTZ
		You've spent tome at the Royal
		Tracking School of Malaysia.
		I can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied.
		I understand you, Captain. We
		understand each other.

	There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
	Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
	it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
	assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

				WILLARD
		Do you know me?

				KURTZ
		Yes.

	Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
	word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

				KURTZ
				(continuing)
		Do you know me ?

	He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
	distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.


	237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

	Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
	a primitive civilization.


	238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

	Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
	next to him. He is exhausted.

	Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
	approaches, crouches down.

				CHEF
		Captain -- they've been probed
		all this week -- Cong and NVA
		regulars. There's gonna be a
		big offense any time.

				WILLARD
		I know.

	Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

				CHEF
		What are we doing here?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
		just like he said.

				KURTZ
		Yeah, I can see that. He's 
		fuckin nuts --

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				CHEF
		He killed that guy without feeling
		anything.

				WILLARD
		Not a thing.

				CHEF
		When you kill Cong, don't you
		feel something.

				WILLARD
		Sure.
			(thinking)
		Recoil... I feel the recoil of
		my rifle.

	Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


	239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

	Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
	emplacement.

	Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
	to Willard as he passes.

				WILLARD
		This is good -- triple overlapping
		fields of fire -- walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces.

	A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
	runs off to her bunker.

	WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
	of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
	children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've done things, when I was
		alone in the jungle -- that I
		never told anyone about.

	They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
	lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond.

	Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
	Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets.

				CHEF
		This is evil -- evil, Captain.
		We're all gonna die here.

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I know.

				CHEF
		I don't get it -- You said your
		mission was to kill him. Let's
		do it, an' get our asses outta
		here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
		war; I mean, this don't look
		good for America !

				WILLARD
			(lost in his thoughts)
		... he's an amazing officer.

				CHEF
		You got to kill this sonuvabitch
		-- Lance and me, we don'´t
		understand none of this -- Jesus,
		Captain -- I don't wanna die here
		-- Do it quick.

	Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
	nods, sucking a joint.

				WILLARD
		Yeah. I know.

	He thinks.


	240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
	the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
	steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


	241  WILLARD'S VIEW

	An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
	quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
	ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
	military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
	but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

	There are other indications of the modern headquarters
	this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
	tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
	There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
	maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
	garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
	spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
	fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
	"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

	Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
	Willard.

				MOONBY
		He's asleep -- don't bother him.

				KURTZ
		I'm awake.

	Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		You. Get out.

	Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
	Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; suddenly)
		I said get the fuck out !
			(to himself)
		I'm going to kill the little
		weirdo myself tomorrow.
			(he shows some pain
			  when moving his
			  midsection)
		He´s only stayed alive this long
		because he's a good orderly and
		medic. He knows how to use a
		hypodermic.

				WILLARD
		You're gonna get hit tonight,
		bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
		regulars.

				KURTZ
		That's right, the little gook-
		pricks. But they are noble
		little gook-pricks, noble.
		Because they fight with their 
		guts, like animals. And for an
		idea ! That's rich. We fight
		with ingenious machines and
		fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
		But I'll call in a major blotto
		airstrike tonight. We'll have
		ourselves a helluva airstrike
		tonight, a lightshow. How do
		you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
		Light My Fire...'

	Willard shrugs.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Do you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I like it...

				KURTZ
		I love it.

	He rests back, grinning.

				WILLARD
		You've gone crazy.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		No. My thinking is clear.
			(calmly)
		But my soul has gone mad.

	Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
	stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
	literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

	Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
	wound.


	242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
	witnessing the proceedings inside.

				CHEF
			(muttering)
		Kill him -- come on, why don't
		you kill him


	243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
	         NIGHT

	Willard examining the wound.

				KURTZ
			(in pain)
		Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

	Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
	takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
	Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; looking
			  up in pain)
		You see how stupid it would have
		been to blow out my brains? I'm
		dying from the gut anyway.

	Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
	frightened, holds up his hand.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		No -- I don't want to sleep.
		I want to think. Water. Give
		me water.

				WILLARD
		You can't have water after
		morphine.

				KURTZ
		Still playing by the rules.
			(almost
			  affectionately)
		You're a damn good kiler.

				WILLARD
			(still holding the
			  second morphine)
		How's the pain?

				KURTZ
		How's yours?

				WILLARD
		I can handle it.

				KURTZ
		Pain is easy to handle -- but
		nobility.. the nobility of a
		man is judged by how much Truth
		he can handle.

				WILLARD
		What Truth?

				KURTZ
		The truth that you were sent
		here to murder me, ans so far
		you haven't done it. And do
		you know why?
			(looks at him)
		Yes, you know why.
			(he looks)
		Your mission makes about as much
		sense as those idiots who sent
		you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! 
		How long does it take you to
		figure out that nobody knows
		what they're doing here.
			(coldly)
		Except me.

	He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Gimme water.

				WILLARD
		No water.

				KURTZ
		You know what you're doing?
		You are interfering with my
		plans !

	He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
	him impassively.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		This water's got Moonby's acid
		in it --

	He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
	over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
		Think of it. A whole regiment
		of those shitty little Cong --
		War. Total war -- war like you've
		never known it. It's beautiful
		-- you'll love it. Trust me.


	244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT

	We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
	to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

				CHEF
		Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
		do it.

				KURTZ
		Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
		napalm on Speed, too. It's
		spectacular, you'll see.

	Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
	with Chef.


	245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
	hand.

				KURTZ
		Look into the jungle. You can't --
		it's too terrible. You have to
		smear yourself with warpaint to
		look at it -- you have to be a
		cannibal.
			(whispered)
		That's why warpaint was invented.
		Then it becomes your jungle.

	Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

				WILLARD
		How did we get here?

				KURTZ
		Because of all the things we do,
		the thing we do best -- is lie.

				WILLARD
		I think think a lie stinks.

				KURTZ
		Oh Captain, that is so true.

				WILLARD
		Stinks. I could never figure --
			(he drinks from
			  the canteen)
		I could never figure how they
		can teach boys how to bomb villages
		with napalm -- and not let them
		write the word 'fuck' on their
		airplanes.

	Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		You could never figure it because
		it doesn't make sense.

				WILLARD
		Fuck no.

				KURTZ
		I'll tell you what makes sense !
		Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !
		Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out
		of them if they don't do what
		we want.

				WILLARD
		We'll exterminate the fuckers !

	Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
	He draws his bayonet.

				CHEF
		Captain -- kill him.

				KURTZ
		Think of it -- for years, millions
		of years, savages with pathetic
		painted faces were scared shitless
		that fire would rain down from
		the sky. And goddamn, we made
		it happen. God  bless  Dow  !

				CHEF
		Kill him !

	Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
	Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
	FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.


	246  VIEW ON LANCE

	He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort
	of mindless, programmed killer.

				LANCE
			(FIRING)
		Hot damn !

	Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an
	instant of silence, then:


	247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

	The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,
	as illuminating flares light up the blackness.


	248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

	of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of
	razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted
	out to the enemy, poised to attack.


	249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

	Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-
	onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting
	speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish
	in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.


	250  EIS VIEW

	A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche-
	delic hallucination.

	251  VIEW ON THE SOLDIER

				SOLDIER
		Wow...

	Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t
	himself.


	252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

	Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
	around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
	Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
	even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
	salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
	around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and
	purple.

	We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of
	teeth around his neck, his face painted.


	253  FULL VIEW - MONTAGE

	Enemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress.


	254  CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR

	A hand drops a shell and it FIRES.


	255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER

	It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange
	and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some
	sort of cosmic flower.


	256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

	Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a
	death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy.


	257  SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS

	blasting out music.


	258  MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS

	With the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to
	radios in their cars.


	259  SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS

	(In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the
	walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting
	up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock
	and flame fly and it is beautiful to see.

	Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope.


	260  WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV

	Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach-
	ing the outer perimeters. Thousands of them.


	261  FULL SHOT ON KURTZ

				KURTZ
		Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
		Mini-gun.


	262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

	A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
	operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
	BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
	loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
	stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
	7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
	the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
	geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
	as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
	blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.


	263  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Exhilarated, and moving with the MUSIC.

				WILLARD
		Napalm.

	Colby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il-
	luminated by napalm drums, phosphorescent napalm EXPLODES
	beautiful, like a magnificent firework.


	264  VIEW ON KURTZ

				KURTZ
		Claymores, claymores.

	The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
	penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
	Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
	seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
	another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
	ing in front of us.

	The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
	trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
	LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

	Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


	265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

	through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more
	extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm
	but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They
	chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached
	the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
	Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
	weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
	ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


	266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

	The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
	Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,
	blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,
	biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
	horrible savagery.


	267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

	standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;
	he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with
	a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and
	BLASTS more as they come.


	268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

	The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that
	BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance
	opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to
	the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over.

	Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times.
	He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls
	under the enemy's feet.


	269  VIEW ON MOONBY

	sees this and scampers off into the jungle, muttering
	madly to himself.


	270  MED. VIEW - WILLARD AT THE R.T.

	shouting into the radio

				WILLARD
		Code -- Street Gang -- Street
		Gang ! Purgative air strike;
		Street Gang !

	He turns and runs back through the compound with the
	receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.
	The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
	over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into
	them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue
	cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches 
	through metal.


	271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

	Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women
	and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-
	es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.
	The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing
	men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.


	272  VIEW ON WILLARD

	watching this spectacle.


	273  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ

	He rounds  the shadow wall.

	Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a
	machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun
	at his side and steps out.

				KURTZ
			(yelling)
		Charles !

	They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
	who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
	gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
	holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
	beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
	moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
	it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
	and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
	rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
	encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
	machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
	and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.


	274  MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ

	taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the
	wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett
	at the Alamo.


	275  FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS

	The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain
	of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.
	It is the biggest firework show in history.

	The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.
	Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the
	air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of
	MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.


	276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

	following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on
	all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
	into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
	crawling Kurtz

				KURTZ
		Go away -- hide yourself.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing?

				KURTZ
		Going back  - to the jungle to
		die.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back. You can 
		still live.

				KURTZ
		I had immense plans.

				WILLARD
		I'm gonna get you out of here.

				KURTZ
		I was on threshold of great 
		things.

	Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
	holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
	spectacle continues in the b.g.


	277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

	This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
	out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
	to get him onto the boat.


	278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

	The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
	Nu Mung Ba.

							FADE OUT.

	FADE IN.


	279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

	The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
	circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
	is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
	some Montagnards sit near them.

	Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
	they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
	field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
	Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
	f.g. below is Lance, dead.

	Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

				COLBY
		Who is he?

				WILLARD
		He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
		of this war.

							CUT TO:


	280  THE P.B.R.

	battered, moving slowly down the river.


	281  TIGHTER VIEW

	Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
	Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
	left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
	Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
	Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
	The battle is not over.

				KURTZ
		Don't. Don't frighten them away.

	Willard looks down at him.

				WILLARD
		So you understand this?

	Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
	eyes. There is a slight smile.

				KURTZ
		Do I not?


	282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

	The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

				KURTZ
		My river... my people... my jungle...
		my ideas... my country... 		
		my wife...
			(he looks at Willard)
		... my death.

				WILLARD
		You had immense plans... immense plans...

				KURTZ
		Yes...

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
	intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
	at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
	that is no more than a breath.

				KURTZ
		The horror, the horror.

	We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
	The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
	craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

				COLBY
		There.

	Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
	helicopters hooping toward them.

				COLBY
			(continuing)
		How did they know?

				WILLARD
		They must have seen the fire.

	The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
	them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

				COLBY
		They're coming to rescue us.
		They're Medevac.


	283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	He stares up at the sky.

				WILLARD
					(to himself)
		They're coming to take us back.

	Copters directly overhead.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Yeah.

				COLBY
		Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-
	proaching rescue helicopter.


	284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER

	It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
	sky.


	285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at
	the retreating American helicopters.


	286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT

	The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into
	the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		... Don't remember a lot about my
		rehabilitation... but I was sent
		back to the world before the fall
		of Saigon...


	287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

	MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

	Pause. Willard is very silent.

				WILLARD
		I never answered questions about
		Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
		unimportant papers -- but for the
		most part I saved everything.
		There were other letters, personal
		ones written earlier to his wife.
		I brought them to het. I watched
		the fall of Saigon on television
		in a bar in Alameda...


	289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
	borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

	Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
	the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
	his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
	on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
	looks back.

				WILLARD
		Hi.

	Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
	door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
	mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
	sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Come in, Captain Willard.

	He enters.


	289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

	Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

	She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Can I get anything for you?

	There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
	there in the various stages of his career.

	Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
			(continuing)
		Did you know him very well?

				WILLARD
		You get to know each other pretty
		well out there.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		And you admired him?

				WILLARD
		He was a remarkable man. It was
		impossible not to --

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Love him... Yes, it is true.
		That's the hard part for me... I
		knew him better than anyone ... I
		knew him best.

				WILLARD
		You knew him best.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		You were his friend... You must
		have been, if he had given you
		this...
			(the packet)
		If he sent you to his home. He
		was the best this country had --
		he was --

				WILLARD
		Yes, I know...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		I'll never get over it -- But
		I'll always remember him...

				WILLARD
		Both of us...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Men looked up to him...
			(she loses herself
			  in a thought)
		He died as he lived...

				WILLARD
		His death was -- yes, he died as
		he lived.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Were you with him, when...

				WILLARD
		Yes I was... He said his last
		words to me.

	Pause.


	290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
	she will ask.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		What were they?


	291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me.


	292  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	remembering that incredible day moving down the river.

	Our VIEW LOOSENS

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me what he said.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		The horror ! The horror !

				WILLARD
		He spoke of you, ma'am.

	He sits there looking at her.


	293  EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT

	The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of
	the few guests left.

	We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the
	boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie
	is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to
	Willard.

							DISSOLVE TO:


	294  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY

	the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust-
	ed, half-dead Colby. And HOLDING Kurtz, Willard. We HEAR
	THE DOORS' "THE END" as we present the END TITLES.

							FADE OUT.



	              				THE  END
ARCTIC BLUE
by Ross LaManna

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Flying.  Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at
spitting distance from the treetops.  We're in central
Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet.  Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn.

On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face.  This is how all
North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.

Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin.
Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar,
depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.

Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant
by the vastness of the land.  It goes on, and on, and on...

DISSOLVE TO:

A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel
trail running parallel to the pipeline.  The weather turns
sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's
path.

DISSOLVE TO:

The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven,
determined.  He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a
business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.

Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a
predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote.  But the
footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.

DISSOLVE TO:

The weather becomes more oppressive.  Heavy snow, gale winds
and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous.  Eric
strives stubbornly forward.

1	CONTINUED:

DISSOLVE TO:

Eric has gathered some branches.  He tries to make a fire.
Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar
of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the
cold.

His hands are too numb to hold the matches.  After several
attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of
wood, exhausted and frustrated.

DISSOLVE TO:

The snow has covered the pile of branches.  Eric still sits
next to it, partially covered in snow himself.

ERIC

His face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a
purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over.
The wind HOWLS around him.  The snow sticks to his eyelashes
and hair without melting.
									
									END DREAM

2	INT.  DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eric bolts up in bed.  Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits
up and hugs him.  All that can be seen of her in the dark is
a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.  After a
moment, Eric kisses her.  He shakes off the dream and lies
back down.

3	EXT.  HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY

A metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a
pipeline support piling:
						
			PIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR
				  PRIVATE PROPERTY
				  NO   TRESPASSING
				  NO	  HUNTING
				  NO	 TRAPPING
				  NO	 SHOOTING

WIDER

Eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead
of him.  Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's
confident and resolute in attitude.  His clothes have a
distinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan
cotton shirt.  His down parka is unzipped in the sunny,
windless, forty-degree afternoon.
								
								(CONTINUED)
3	CONTINUED:

He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a
four-power scope mounted atop it.  He peers through the
scope.

HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE

He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big,
ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.

BACK TO SCENE

Anne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens
in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation.  She's
twenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue
eyes.  She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born
in it.

Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger.
But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of
a CO2-powered dart gun.

NEW ANGLE

The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy
shoulder.  The wolf takes off running, but almost
immediately slows, sits, then lies down.

Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing
deeply.  Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.
					
					ERIC
			What a beauty.
			(to Anne Marie)
			Hand me the transmitter.

Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device
attached to a steel collar band.  Eric puts the collar
loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all
the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal.
Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some
photos.

With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric
backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its
narcosis.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			He's coming around fine.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Be right back.  I left my
			camcorder in the car.
								
								(CONTINUED)
3	CONTINUED:  (2)

FOLLOW ANNE MARIE

as she hurries back to their International Scout.  On the
door of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick,
under which are the words:
						
			NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.

Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.

ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF

Eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and
trots unsteadily away.  Near the treeline the wolf turns,
glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.

NEW ANGLE

Anne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat.  Looking through
the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline
piling and a rock formation.  Eric turns toward her and a
glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.
					
					ERIC
			Anne Marie!  Stop!

She glances down.  Something metal is half-buried in the
dead leaves and gravel.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Don't move.

Eric runs over.  He pokes at the object with a stick.  With
a SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half.  Anne
Marie jumps back.  Eric brushes the dead leaves on the
ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the
gully.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Goddamn trappers!

He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing
several others attached to one another by a long chain.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Takes nerve, laying traplines on
			restricted land.

Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the
pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.
								
								(CONTINUED)
3	CONTINUED:  (3)

Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the
Haul Road.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			What are you doing?
					
					ERIC
			He still might be around.  I saw
			fresh tire tracks coming in.

HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE

The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon,
north and south.  In the distance, a jeep is parked on the
Haul Road.  Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow
ravine.

BACK TO SCENE

Eric hurries down the footpegs.
					
					ERIC
			Man and a jeep, about a mile and
			a half down.

He jumps into the Scout.  Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into
the hatchback.  As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.

4	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH.

5	EXT.  HAUL ROAD

Startled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uproots
his traps and runs out of the ravine.  He WHISTLES and
another Trapper appears nearby.

6	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP

They pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep.  It's
oddly well-equipped, however.  Bolted to the dashboard is an
expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver
with a round locating screen.  They zoom off.

7	INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric stomps on the gas.  The dust from the jeep obscures his
view but he's gaining on them anyway.  Anne Marie hangs on
and squints her eyes against the choking dust.



8	INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)

The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian.
His entire outfit is made of animal hide.  He has long red
hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
sneer.  While driving, he scans along the pipeline.
					
					LEMALLE
			Where the fuck did you drop
			Corbett off?

In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and
looks grim.  He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly
matted hair and tired grey eyes.  He's dressed in a brown
long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw
holster strapped to his leg.  Despite his intimidating air,
confrontation is not his style.

He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy
creek.
					
					MITCHELL
			He's over there.

9	EXT.  HAUL ROAD

Turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the
creek bed without slowing.  Bouncing, it comes down hard
against the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark.
LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the
mud.

Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.

10   INT.  SCOUT

Eric opens his door.  To Anne Marie:
					
					ERIC
			Stay here.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Be careful -- there're two of
			them.

Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne
Marie.
					
					ERIC
			If I unzip my parka, stick this
			out the window.

11   EXT.  HAUL ROAD

Eric confidently approaches the jeep.
								
								(CONTINUED)
11   CONTINUED:

Then, a third trapper climbs from the creek.  He's got a
line of traps slung around his neck and a world of
experience on his face.  He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long
huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.

He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's
eyes.  He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton
coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots.  On his belt is
a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.

Eric slows down.  He didn't expect to face anyone as
formidable as Corbett.

12   INT. / EXT. JEEP

Emboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the
back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.
					
					CORBETT
			(to LeMalle)
			No shooting.  Let's see who's so
			interested in us.

Corbett has an incongruously affable voice.  He throws his
traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.
					
					MITCHELL
			(to Corbett)
			Ain't worth it, Ben...

13   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT

As Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've
been a great idea.  Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the
air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.
					
					ERIC
			You got two counts against you --
			trapping out of season and
			poaching on restricted land.
					
					CORBETT
			Can't be much of a crime, if all
			they got minding the area is a
			cocky kid.
					
					ERIC
			I got your plate number, asshole.
			Maybe you feel like spending a
			few months in jail.

Corbett just smiles.
								
								(CONTINUED)
13   CONTINUED:

But LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep
window.

Seeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowly
unzips his parka.
					
					LEMALLE
			Ben?  Sure you don't want me to
			drop the fucker?

Corbett doesn't answer.  Then, his eyes narrow and he looks
past Eric at the Scout.

CORBETT'S POV

The passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another
rifle out the window.

BACK TO SCENE

Eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne
Marie's backing him up.
					
					ERIC
			You leave and don't come back,
			that's the end of it.

After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away
from Eric.  He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.

Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and
throws it in the back seat.

ANGLE ON TRAPPERS

Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine.
LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut.
While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp
piece of granite.   He cusses and pushes harder.

14   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING

Eric walks back to the Scout.  He feels the trappers' eyes
on his back, but forces himself not to hurry.

The trappers free their vehicle.  Corbett gets in the
driver's seat, and they take off.

15   INT.  SCOUT

Anne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic
tranquilizer rifle back in the window.
								
								(CONTINUED)
15   CONTINUED:

					
					ANNE MARIE
			(unnerved)
			Great idea -- pointing a lousy
			dart gun at some nut with a
			high-powered hunting rifle.
					
					ERIC
			Bastards took off, though, didn't
			they?

16   EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY

The trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area.
Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.

17   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)

Corbett broods while driving.  Mitchell looks out the
window.  The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable.
					
					LEMALLE
			All this fuckin' land, and we're
			locked out.  Makes me puke.
					
					CORBETT
			Jawing about it won't change it.
					
					LEMALLE
			Three hundred seventy-five
			million acres in this state.  I'm
			real tired of runnin' into
			people.
					
					MITCHELL
			Then don't look to your left.

18   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP

A brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a
bend in a small river.  Scattered about is an assortment of
expensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other
garbage.

Three toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and
BLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns.
They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and
stops.

19   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP

LeMalle grabs his carbine.
					
					CORBETT
			Leave it here.
								
								(CONTINUED)

19   CONTINUED:
					
					MITCHELL
			Let's keep going.  We're only an
			hour from Devil's Cauldron.
					
					CORBETT
			(pats Mitchell's shoulder)
			Relax.  I just want to ask them
			how the hunting is.

20   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP

Corbett gets out of the jeep.  He regards the Sportsmen,
their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.

The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett.  He
walks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksack
stuffed with dead ermine.  After a long, tense moment,
Corbett smiles.
					
					CORBETT
			Looks like you've had some luck.
			Where's your guide?
					
					SPORTSMAN #1
			We're on our own, if it's any of
			your damn business.
					
					CORBETT
			(re ermine)
			You did real good.

He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.
					
					LEMALLE
			(to Corbett)
			No swinging shit.  They're over
			their goddamned limit.
					
					CORBETT
			(to Sportsmen)
			My friend is right.  Supposed to
			have a licensed guide when you're
			on this land, too.
					
					SPORTSMAN #1
			Hey, we paid our fuckin' permit
			fees.

LeMalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire.  No one
notices that in the b.g., quiet Sportsman #3 unzips his
parka, exposing a .45 Peacemaker in a belt holster.
								
								(CONTINUED)
20   CONTINUED:
					
					SPORTSMAN #2
			I were you, I'd drive right on
			outta here again.  Now.
					
					CORBETT
			(calmly)
			This was my roaming land, 'til
			the government took it over.
			Only Innuit can hunt here now,
			and tourists, like you.

Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of
the Land Rover.  Pissed, Sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to
him.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			According to tribal law, hunters
			passing through the land of
			another tribe can only take game
			to survive.  They can eat the
			meat, but have to surrender the
			hides.

LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the
ermine.
					
					LEMALLE
			Want the meat?
					
					SPORTSMAN #1

			Fuck you, dirtball.

Corbett chuckles and Mitchell spits.

WIDER

LeMalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the
Land Rover, many still in their packages.  He helps himself
to some sandwiches and a 12-pack of beer.
					
					LEMALLE
			I say shoot 'em, bury 'em with
			their shiny new car.
					
					MITCHELL
			(to LeMalle)
			If you're gonna take something,
			take it and let's go.

Corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack.
								
								(CONTINUED)
20   CONTINUED:  (2)

NEW ANGLE

Suddenly, Sportsman #3 reaches inside his parka and pulls
the pistol.  He swings it toward LeMalle.

LeMalle looks up when he hears the HAMMER cock.

There is a deafeningly loud SHOT.

Sportsman #3 falls down dead at LeMalle's feet.

Off to one side, Corbett holds a huge, smoking .44 magnum
six-shooter in his hand.

Shotgun in hand, Sportsman #1 gauges his chances of blasting
Corbett.  Nil.  When Corbett turns to him, he lies the
weapon down.  Sportsman #2 rushes to his friend.

Looking bleak, Mitchell spits again.  Corbett crosses to
LeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to
steal.  Chastised, LeMalle smolders.  After a moment:
					
					CORBETT
			(to Sportsmen)
			Put him in your truck.  Smell of
			blood will attract the bears.
			(to trappers)
			Let's go.

As Corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that
he's stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover.

Near the jeep, LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.
					
					LEMALLE

			I don't believe in leavin'
			witnesses behind, Ben.
					
					MITCHELL
			It was self defense.  Leave it at
			that.
					
					LEMALLE
			You think those fucks will tell
			it that way?
					
					CORBETT
			(ending the argument)
			We'll get a head start before
			they go crying to the law.

Corbett turns and FIRES two rounds from his .44 into the
engine of the Land Rover.  The Sportsmen stare and sputter.
								
								(CONTINUED)
20   CONTINUED:  (3)
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing; to Sportsmen)
			You can pack out of here -- two,
			three days' hike along this river
			at most.  Weather should hold
			this early in the season.

Corbett and Mitchell get in their jeep.

LEMALLE

isn't yet satisfied.  He walks back over to the Sportsmen,
kneeling beside their fallen friend, and crouches right
beside them.  Intimidated, Sportsman #2 looks away, but
LeMalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him.
					
					LEMALLE
			Think I'm pretty?  You better
			forget how we look, 'cause next
			time they won't keep me from
			killing you.  This land ain't
			quite civilized, you know...

He unsheathes his buck knife.  BELOW FRAME, he slices across
the forehead of the dead Sportsman, peels back his scalp and
cuts it loose, Indian-style.  The Sportsmen are stunned and
sickened.

ANGLE ON TRAPPERS' JEEP

Corbett looks at Mitchell and wearily shakes his head.
					
					MITCHELL
			At least he scalped the dead one.

21   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSK

Devil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny
dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk.  The town
squats, ugly and temporary-looking, in a dirt clearing fifty
miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Thirty miles east of the
Pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.

At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip.  Mixed with the
prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated
houses.  The boon brought by men building the pipeline is
long gone.  Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and
bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the
depression of the oncoming winter.

Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually
blanket the valley with fog.  The spa is log-walled and
horseshoe- shaped, with partitioned baths inside.  Facing it

Maqi, six one-room cabins for let, and an unused dance hall.

LEO MEYERLING opens the tailgate of a Dodge truck with the
Northland Petroleum logo and "District Supervisor" on the
door.  Meyerling is short and bald with a completely
disreputable face.  He staples a poster on a wall.  It has a
picture of him on it, and:
						
				LEO MEYERLING
					for
				  State Legislature
			 VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE'S FRIEND!

22   EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE

Corbett and the other trappers drive past Meyerling and park
their jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills.

23   INT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE

A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
meetings reads: "Live each day so you can look every damn
man in the eye and tell him to go to hell."  There is a post
office in the corner with some combination boxes and a
wicketless window.

The trappers come in.  Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
boots off.  One of his wool socks is wet.  He nods to the
man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER.  Wilder is short
and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and
weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his
sixty years.
					
					CORBETT
			Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
					
					WILDER
			(wary)
			Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and
			I'd like to keep it that way.
					
					CORBETT
			(conciliatory)
			Just passing through.

A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo), wearing thick glasses,
several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fusses
behind the counter.  He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hot
springs spa and the general store.

LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky.  Kenai stares at
LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky.  Corbett
pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai.

23   CONTINUED:
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing; re boot)
			Needs patching.
					
					KENAI
			Twenty-five dollar.
					
					CORBETT

Kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out.  Corbett pays
him.  Meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the
corkboard.
					
					MEYERLING
			I hope I can count on you
			gentlemen to vote for The
			People's Friend this November.
					
					CORBETT
			Share some of that oil company
			money in your pocket and you can.

Meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster on
the wall.  LeMalle throws his knife and it STICKS in the
poster between Meyerling's spread fingers.  Meyerling jumps
back and the trappers laugh.  Meyerling looks to Wilder for
support.
					
					WILDER
			(to Meyerling)
			One flier comes loose and I shoot
			you for littering.
					
					MEYERLING
			(exiting; grudgeless)
			Have your fun... just remember

24   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON VALLEY - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

An early STORM has blown in from the north, bringing
whipping winds and freezing rain.

25   INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Corbett peers out the tiny window, frowning.  LeMalle cleans
his carbine while eating beans and bacon.  Mitchell hunches
over a table.  He's making a scrimshaw -- delicately
engraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece of
whale bone.  He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett.
					
					MITCHELL
			So much for the walking weather

Mitchell glances at LeMalle, then at Corbett.

					MITCHELL
			Okay by me.  You're the one likes

					CORBETT
			Leave my traps.  We'll tag up,

26   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - "THE TURTLE" - DAY

The winds have died down.  The rain has turned to a light
snow.

A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul
Road.  It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass
and aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires.
The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.

An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out.
The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for
400 miles, is closed to the public.  An arriving vehicle,
therefore, is news.  The front door of the dwelling opens.
Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder.
								
								(CONTINUED)
26   CONTINUED:
					
					WILDER
			I was making my rounds, saw your

			I bet you haven't had lunch.

			Bet you're right.  But I didn't

					ERIC
			-- We appreciate the company.
			Anne Marie's getting cabin fever

Anne Marie shoots a look at Eric but doesn't disagree --
this is obviously an issue with them.  Wilder looks with
amusement at the mobile dwelling.
					
					WILDER
			What'd you say they call these
			spaceships?
					
					ERIC
			Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.

			I call it 'the Turtle,' as in

Looking past Wilder, Eric points out some smoke on the
horizon.

			Have to pass on that lunch.

									CUT TO:

27   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LATER THAT DAY

Everything seems peaceful enough.  The SOS fire (made from
burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black
smoke) has burnt down to embers.

Eric, Anne Marie and Wilder pull up in Wilder's pickup.

The two Sportsmen sit in the front seat of the Land Rover,
but they don't react to the arrival of the rescuers.  In the
back seat, a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass.

Something is amiss.  Eric shoots a look of trepidation at
Anne Marie as they get out of the pickup.   Wilder pulls the
door of the Land Rover open.

A Sportsman slumps out onto the ground.  His eyes are open
and his tongue pokes out between his lips.  His skin is
blue-white. (He looks, in fact, much like Eric's nightmare.)

Startled, Eric steps back.  Anne Marie gasps with horror.
Wilder unzips the Sportsman's light windbreaker and listens
for a heartbeat.  Nothing.
					
					WILDER
			Stupid goddamn greenhorns!  Froze
			to death.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			It's not even winter!
					
					WILDER
			They got wet in the rain.  Core
			body temperature dropped, got
			drowsy, probably didn't even know
			what was happening.

Eric stares at the dead Sportsmen.
								
								(CONTINUED)
27   CONTINUED:
					
					WILDER
			(continuing)
			Question is why they sat here
			when the storm moved in.  Check
			their stuff while I sniff around.

Wilder tries the ignition.  The starter TURNS OVER, but the
engine makes a horrendous GRINDING.  He walks to the front
of the vehicle.  Noticing the bullet holes in the grille, he
bends down for a closer look.

NEW ANGLE

Eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful
supplies.  Still in their packages are some matchbox-sized
ELT locating beacons.
					
					ERIC
			They had Emergency Locater
			Transmitters, but didn't use
			them.
			(opens one up; shakes his
				head)
			Maybe because they didn't bring
			batteries.

CLOSE

Anne Marie opens the back door of the Land Rover.  She pulls
back the camping blanket... and uncovers the third
Sportsman.  The torn red flesh on his head and his
bugged-out eyes are a hideous sight.

Anne Marie SCREAMS and stumbles away.

28   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LAND ROVER

Eric runs over to her as she tries to catch her breath.

Wilder looks at the third Sportsman and angrily kicks the
side of the Land Rover.
					
					WILDER
			I'm too old for this shit.
					
					ERIC
			Any idea who could've done it?

Sourly, Wilder points to a patch of frozen mud under the
vehicle.
					
					WILDER
			A certain sonofabitch bastard
					-more-
								
								(CONTINUED)
28   CONTINUED:
					
					WILDER (Cont'd)
			wearing a damaged mountain boot.
			Left a footprint clear as an
			autograph.

Wilder examines the Sportsman, finding the bullet hole in
his chest.
					
					WILDER
			(continuing)
			Even for Ben Corbett, this is
			nasty.  Man's got balls.  He was
			sitting in Devil's Cauldron when
			I left, calm as can be.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Thank God.  You can arrest him.
					
					WILDER
			Not necessarily.  Corbett's awful
			hardbitten these days.

Wilder leans against the Land Rover, feeling tired.
					
					WILDER
			(continuing)
			His old roaming area's all
			private reserve now.  Normally,
			long as he stays civil in my
			jurisdiction, I let him be.
			(beat)
			Won't be able to take him by my
			lonesome, though.  Nobody in
			town'll lift a finger on this.

Eric looks hard at the dead Sportsmen.
					
					ERIC
			(quietly)
			I'll go into town with you.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Eric, leave it alone.  It's not
			your business.
					
					ERIC
			(shakes his head)
			No way can he get away with this.
			I'll be back by tonight.

29   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AFTERNOON

The town is quiet.



30   INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy
Inupiat hooker, DIXIE.

He looks up as Eric comes into the spa.  Eric holds
Corbett's boots, which have been repaired.  Eric pauses when
he sees Corbett.  There is a flash of recognition between
them.
					
					ERIC
			Ben Corbett?
					
					CORBETT
			Yep.  Afraid you have me at a
			disadvantage.
					
					ERIC
			Kenai at the general store asked
			me to bring these.  Didn't expect
			we'd already met.
					
					CORBETT
			No big deal.  We just got off on
			the wrong foot.  What's your
			name?

Eric glances down at Corbett's duffel bag, which sits on the
floor next to Corbett's tub.  Corbett's magnum rests on top
of it, well within reach.  Corbett notices Eric's interest
in it.  He leans back and smiles.
					
					ERIC
			Desmond.
					
					CORBETT
			New to the country, kid?
					
					ERIC
			Six months.  Ecological study for
			Northland Oil.
					
					CORBETT
			Ecology.  Folks use that term for
			everything but what it means:
			who's eating who.

Putting his hand on Dixie's shoulder, Corbett stands and
gets out of the tub.  His sinewy body, resembling a
scarecrow made of steel cable, is covered with scars.  He
wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to Eric.
								
								(CONTINUED)
30   CONTINUED:
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Now, why don't you get around to
			saying what you want.

Corbett grabs his boots from Eric and finds himself facing a
revolver, which Eric has been hiding inside one of the
boots.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing; smiling)
			You wouldn't shoot anyone...
					
					WILDER (OS)
			But I would.

NEW ANGLE

Wilder has come in the back way and stands behind Corbett
with a 12-gauge shotgun.  He kicks Corbett's magnum out of
reach.
					
					CORBETT
			All this for laying traps on
			private land?
					
					WILDER
			You left a footprint at the
			Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty
			sight there, Ben, 'cause the two
			men you didn't shoot and mutilate
			died of exposure.

Corbett shakes his head but remains implacable.
					
					CORBETT
			Christ if I shouldn't know better
			than to step in soft earth.  I've
			seen footprints in the tundra a
			hundred years old.
					
					WILDER
			(to Eric)
			I got it from here.  Thanks.
					
					CORBETT
			(to Wilder)
			Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks
			out of my kit, will you?

31   EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric comes outside.  Earl Kenai, overdressed for the weather
in gloves, mukluks and a full-length sealskin coat, stands
								
								(CONTINUED)
31   CONTINUED:

shivering by a woodshed near the hot springs, hacksawing a
piece of meat from a frozen moose carcass.
					
					KENAI
			Before white men came, my people
			lived in sod houses underground
			and laid our dead on the tundra.
			Now we live above ground and bury
			our dead, and we haven't been
			warm since.

Wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and Corbett's
duffel bag cradled in his arm.  Handcuffed, Corbett walks in
front of him.

Kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with Corbett as he
goes by.  Corbett stops next to Eric and smiles.

					
					CORBETT
			Nice bluff the other day with the
			tranquilizer gun out your jeep
			window.  See you again, maybe.
					
					ERIC
			(unintimidated)
			Yeah.  Maybe so.

32   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - FOLLOW WILDER

as he leads Corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of
town.  They approach a prefab house perched on skids under a
tall antenna tower.  Mounted above the shack, a DC wind
charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze.  From
within the cabin comes an anomalous SOUND -- MTV.  Wilder
KNOCKS on the door.

ARTHUR NEFF, a pasty-white, 45-year-old ex-Texan, pulls the
door open.  His customary grin fades when he sees Corbett.

33   INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE

Wilder pushes Corbett inside past Neff.
					
					WILDER
			I need to call Fairbanks.

Neff just stares at Corbett.
					
					WILDER
			(continuing)
			Neff!  Dial it up.  State police.

With a "what can I do but oblige?" look to Corbett, Neff
sits in front of the RCA Alascom radio telephone and dials.
								
								(CONTINUED)
33   CONTINUED:
					
					NEFF
			(on phone)
			Fairbanks Alascom?  Patch me
			through to the State Police.

After a moment, he hands the receiver to Wilder.  Wilder
takes it, keeping one eye and the shotgun on Corbett.
					
					WILDER
			(on phone)
			This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in
			Devil's Cauldron.  Had some
			killings here.  I got a suspect;
			be real nice if someone came and
			took him off my hands.
					
					STATE POLICEMAN (VO)
			(thru phone)
			On a good day I couldn't spare a
			crosswalk guard.  But now, no
			way.  Folks're batshit with the
			weather turning sour.  Bring him
			in yourself.
					
					WILDER
			(on phone)
			Next plane's not coming 'til next
			Monday.
					
					STATE POLICEMAN (VO)
			(thru phone)
			Sit your suspect out in the cold.
			He'll keep.
					
					WILDER
			(on phone)
			This man's friends ain't gonna
			look favorably on his
			incarceration.
					
					STATE POLICEMAN (VO)
			(thru phone; Mr. Glib)
			So shoot him.  Won't have to feed
			him that way --

Angry, Wilder slams the receiver down.

34   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

In one room, there is a wood-burning cookstove and an Ashley
heat stove, a table, a bunk and a small window.  Behind a
cloth partition is an eight by six holding cell.  The frame
of an iron-bar door is securely cemented to the log walls.
Wilder comes in with Corbett and locks him in the cell.
								
								(CONTINUED)
34   CONTINUED:
					
					CORBETT
			Mind if I get some stuff from my
			kit?

Wilder does mind.  He locks the duffel bag and Corbett's .44
in his desk drawer.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Sam, listen -- I shot to defend
			my man.  Other guy drew first.
					
					WILDER
			If that was all, fine.  But
			carving him up, stranding the
			others, that's too fucking much.
			Is everything that walks, crawls,
			flies or swims fair game to you?
					
					CORBETT
			(softly)
			I'll get loose before that plane
			comes.
					
					WILDER
			Don't try me.  I'll kill you if
			it comes to it.

35   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AFTERNOON

As Eric walks into Kenai's general store, Neff hurries over.
					
					NEFF
			Mr. Desmond!
			(grins; sticks his hand
				out)
			Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the
			Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell
			the boys in DC to keep those
			goodies coming.
					
					ERIC
			Sure.
					
					NEFF
			Snowplow, generator, TV dish...
			hell, we get the goddamn Playboy
			Channel!  Here, this is for you.

He hands Eric a piece of styrofoam shaped like a commode
seat.
								
								(CONTINUED)
35   CONTINUED:
					
					NEFF
			(continuing)

			Warm to forty below.  Remember,
			anything you want, you ask Arthur
			Neff.

36   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - NIGHT

The storm has passed.   A faint CHUGGING emanates from the
small orange generator trailer behind the Turtle.  Eric
pulls up and parks the Scout.

37   INT.  THE TURTLE

Nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds Eric's
research equipment and Anne Marie's photographic supplies.
In one corner of the Turtle are several of her black and
white prints.  All are of man-made objects whose presence is
juxtaposed with the natural surroundings.

Relieved he's home in one piece, Anne Marie meets Eric at
the door and kisses him.  Carrying a brown-paper-wrapped
package, Eric follows her into the kitchen, where she's
preparing dinner.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Did you catch Corbett?
					
					ERIC
			Sure did.  He was one of the
			trappers we rousted from the Haul
			Road.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Was there any trouble?
					
					ERIC
			He was sitting in a hot tub with
			a hooker.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Going after killers isn't the
			same as chasing poachers, Eric.
					
					ERIC
			(grins)
			Can't help myself.  Corbett's
			type always pisses me off.
			(hands her the package)
			Oh, I found this at the post
			office.  Had your name on it.
								
								(CONTINUED)
37   CONTINUED:

Perplexed, she looks at the return address --
Bloomingdale's.  Delighted, she tears it open.  Inside is a
pretty, elegant dress.  Anne Marie kisses him.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
					
					ERIC
			You were looking at it in the
			catalog.  Don't know where you
			can wear it...
					
					ANNE MARIE
			I'll wear it for you.  And I can
			wear it when we go home.  We
			won't be here forever.
					
					ERIC
			(frowning)
			You make it sound like a prison
			sentence.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			That's not what I meant.
					
					ERIC
			It's exactly what you meant.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Look, why get into this again.
			As long as it's working, let's
			leave it alone.  It's been nice
			so far.  We're together --
					
					ERIC
			-- Permanently?
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(sighs)
			Do I want to be with you
			permanently?  Yes, I think I do.
			But be with what you do and the
			way you live?  That I don't know.
			C'mon, Eric, until I met you,
			coming back to Alaska was totally

			out of the question for me.  But
			I'm here.  I'm getting great
			pictures, and I'm having fun.
			(slips her arms around him)
			I love you.
			(kisses him)
			So shut up and let's eat.



38   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT

An old primer-grey station wagon rattles into town and
parks.  With an unlit cheroot stuck in his mouth, "VIKING"
BOB CORBETT gets out and stretches.  He's 38, six-foot-six,
with sandy hair, beard, ruddy skin, and his brother's dark
eyes.

He looks around for some sign of life.  He spots Neff
tending one of the windmills and walks over to him.
					
					VIKING BOB
			I'm looking for some trappers.
			Ben Corbett, Mitchell, LeMalle.
			Seen 'em?
					
					NEFF
			Yesterday.  Said they were going
			to Cache.  They were thirsty, but
			we were voted dry.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Shit.

As Viking Bob walks back to his station wagon, he notices
Kenai poking around in front of Wilder's cabin.

VIKING BOB'S POV

Illuminated by a bare bulb is Wilder's typical bush-country
front yard.  Piled are five cords of wood, boxes, tarps,
stove parts, saw horses, 55-gallon drums, dismantled snow
machines, wash tubs, tires, etc.

Bunching his collar around his neck, Kenai shivers and sorts
through Corbett's traps.

NEW ANGLE

Viking Bob ambles over to Kenai.
					
					VIKING BOB
			These yours?
					
					KENAI
			Gonna make an offer.  Man who
			owns them won't need them where
			he's going.

39   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

Wilder peers out the window and sees Viking Bob, then turns
to Corbett.
								
								(CONTINUED)
39   CONTINUED:
					
					WILDER
			Back against the bars.  Now.

Wilder handcuffs Corbett's hands to the cell door bars, then
quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across Corbett's face,
covering his mouth.

Stuffing a .357 magnum in his belt, Wilder, coatless, slips
outside.

As soon as he's out the door, Corbett cranes his neck and
painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner
of the door hinge.

40   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN

The look on Wilder's face tells Kenai to shut up.  Viking
Bob realizes something's up.
					
					WILDER
			Your brother and the boys left me
			some traps to sell for them.
			They're gone --
					
					VIKING BOB
			-- To Cache.  So I heard.  Ben
			never said nothing to me about
			selling his gear.

41   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

Corbett gets the tape partially off his mouth.  He pries one
of his boots off and kicks it through a window.
					
					CORBETT
			Bob!  They got me on a murder
			charge!

42   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN

Wilder pulls his .357 out.
					
					WILDER
			Sorry, Bob.  I'll have to keep
			you here 'til I ship him south.

Viking Bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at Wilder, then
punching him in the gut.  Wilder sprawls among the junk,
dropping his revolver.  Kenai freezes, not about to take
sides.

Before Viking Bob can come at him again, Wilder grabs for
his .357. Viking Bob jumps back and bolts for his car.
								
								(CONTINUED)
42   CONTINUED:

He dives into his station wagon and starts it up.  As he
drives past, Wilder POPS off a few rounds, but Viking Bob
keeps going.

NEW ANGLE

Kenai helps Wilder up.  Pissed, Wilder shoves him against
the cabin.
					
					WILDER
			(continuing)
			You stupid, greedy, loudmouth
			sonofabitch!  He'll have the
			others here in a few hours.  You
			fucked me up, now you're gonna
			help me move him.
					
					KENAI
			(shakes head)
			Forget it, Sam.  I never work for
			free.

43   INT.  THE TURTLE - NIGHT

Anne Marie sits on the floor, editing one of her VIDEOTAPES.
On the monitor, it SHOWS footage of the traps under the
pipeline piling.  Eric comes out of the back module holding
two ELT pendants.  He glances over at the monitor and nods
approvingly.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			I still can't believe I'm being
			financed by an oil company.
			Especially when they get a look
			at these pictures.  Technology in
			the wilderness; not too pretty.
			(re ELTs)
			What's that?
					
					ERIC
			I thought I should check our
			emergency transmitters.

Eric activates the ELT's.  They emit an SOS pattern of radio
waves -- three short, three long and three short.  This is
visible as rhythmic INTERFERENCE on Anne Marie's video
MONITOR.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Avalanche season is coming.
								
								(CONTINUED)
43   CONTINUED:
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Winter.  Two straight months of
			night -- we may never get out of
			bed.
			(kisses him)
			Which would suit me fine.
					
					ERIC
			Prolonged darkness makes people
			crazy.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Not me.  I'm equipped.

She turns on a small S-VHS video camera and snaps off the
room lights.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(continuing)
			Allow me to give you a practical
			demonstration of low-light
			infrared photography...

She does so by seductively undressing for the camera.  She's
SEEN on the MONITOR, illuminated by the "light" from the hot
stove.  Eric appreciates the show.  He crawls toward her.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(continuing)
			High-tech in the wilderness.
			Gets me excited, too.
					
					ERIC
			Come here...

Laughing, he wrestles her to the rug.

44   EXT.  HILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT

There is a full moon and a clear night sky.  Viking Bob's
station wagon is parked out of sight.  He sits inside,
waiting.

He hears an ENGINE starting in the distance.  Sitting up, he
grabs some binoculars.

HIS POV

Wilder's extended cab truck pulls out, heading west.

45   EXT.  FOOTHILLS - NIGHT

In the bright moonlight, two people are seen in Wilder's
truck as it speeds along a dirt road.

Viking Bob follows at a discreet distance, headlights off.
								
								(CONTINUED)
45   CONTINUED:

NEW ANGLE

Viking Bob turns and takes the literal high road -- a narrow
trail above the roadway that Wilder's truck is on.

He zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry, then drops
back down onto the road and waits in ambush.

As Wilder's truck approaches, Viking Bob turns on his bright
lights and crouches behind his car door with a shotgun.

Wilder's truck screeches to a stop.

CLOSER

Kenai gets out with his hands up.

Viking Bob slowly approaches Wilder's truck.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Ben?

No answer.  Viking Bob looks in the cab.  Kenai's passenger
is Dixie, the Inupiat hooker.  Viking Bob grabs Kenai and
pushes the barrel of the shotgun hard against his cheek.
					
					VIKING BOB
			(continuing)
			Where's Ben Corbett?
					
					KENAI
			I have no argument with you, Bob.
			Wilder said I could keep his
			truck if I drove it ten miles
			away from town.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Where did they go?
					
					KENAI
			He didn't say, but I would guess
			the opposite way from here.

Viking Bob shoves Kenai against the truck, then punches him
for good measure.  Cussing, he runs back to his station
wagon and drives off.
									
									CUT TO:

46   INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE - NIGHT

Eric and Anne Marie are asleep.  Eric starts awake at the OS
sound of a high-pitched vehicle HORN and an approaching
ENGINE.




47   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE

Eric pulls the door open.  Wilder is untying Corbett from
the snowmobile.
					
					WILDER
			I got an emergency on my hands.

Corbett smiles at Eric as he walks inside.

48   INT.  THE TURTLE

Eric, Wilder and Corbett sit in the front module.  Anne
Marie, nervous, wearing a down robe, serves coffee.  She
stares at Corbett, trying to reconcile his quiet demeanor
with what she saw that afternoon.  Corbett smiles at Eric.
					
					WILDER
			(to Eric)
			...You give us a ride in the
			Cessna you got hangared at the
			pumping station, we'll be in
			Fairbanks in a few hours.
					
					ERIC
			That's what we should've done in
			the first place.
					
					WILDER
			I could've sat tight for the
			transport, 'til Bob came poking
			around.
					
					CORBETT
			(to Wilder; re Anne Marie)
			A lot to ask, dragging him away
			from such a good-looking girl --
					
					ERIC
			(irritated)
			-- To take you to jail?  It'll be
			my pleasure.
					
					WILDER
			(to Eric)
			You better get some sleep.
					
					CORBETT
			Good idea.  Flying over mountains
			can give you some nasty
			surprises.  Go too low, one of
			the clouds might have a big rock
			inside it.
								
								(CONTINUED)
48   CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			(hard)
			I'll get you there all right.

Eric takes Anne Marie to the rear module, leaving Wilder
with his prisoner.
									
									CUT TO:

49   INT.  THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT

A bottle of Eric's Scotch sits almost empty on the table
beside Wilder.  Wilder dozes in a chair facing Corbett.

Corbett is awake.  He contorts his body to bring his
handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of
him.  He eyes Wilder's .357.  It's in a lefty Sam Browne
holster.  No way to take it without waking Wilder.

Corbett stands and inches toward the door.  As he pulls it
open, the insulation makes enough NOISE to stir Wilder.

Wilder gets up and pushes Corbett back into his chair.
					
					WILDER
			Goddammit, I don't need this
			aggravation.  I'll shoot you,
			Ben.  Bank on it.
					
					CORBETT
			I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
					
					WILDER
			I'm not too old to knock the snot
			out of you!
					
					CORBETT
			Nothing personal.

Wilder's mind clears enough to realize that Corbett's hands
are in front of him.  He reaches for his .357.  Corbett
butts into Wilder's midsection with his head.  Amazingly,
Wilder stays on his feet.

Corbett hurries back to the door.  Wilder lunges,
bull-determined to hold onto him.  Corbett smashes Wilder
across the face with his clenched hands.  Wilder goes down
hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there.
Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still
breathing.  But then, hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module,
Corbett flees.



50   INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE

Eric is pulling on his pants.

51   INT.  THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE

Eric rushes in.  The outside door is open and Wilder lies on
the floor.   His holster is empty.  Anne Marie comes in and
crosses to Wilder.

Eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the
company-issue equipment, coming up with a huge Remington
bolt-action bear rifle.  Unfamiliar with weapons, Eric tears
open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle.

52   EXT.  THE TURTLE

Corbett is trying to start Eric's Scout.

Eric fires a loud warning SHOT from the Turtle doorway.
					
					ERIC
			You want to try that handgun
			against this rifle, go ahead.

Corbett sits in the Scout for a long moment, weighing his
odds.  He takes his hands off the steering wheel...

Eric SHOOTS again, this time SMASHING the side-view mirror
and window next to Corbett's head.

Still handcuffed, Corbett gets out of the Scout.  Holding
the .357 gingerly by the butt, he puts it on the hood of the
Scout.
					
					CORBETT
			Some day you might have to face
			me without a gun.

53   INT.  THE TURTLE

Eric leads Corbett in.  Anne Marie is cradling Wilder's
head. She's crying.  Eric looks at Wilder.  There is blood
coming from his ear and he's fading fast.
					
					WILDER
			(thickly)
			Fetch him back?
			(Eric nods)
			Don't let him walk...

Eric nods again.  Wilder holds his gaze on Eric, then simply
stops breathing.
								
								(CONTINUED)
53   CONTINUED:

Eric is stunned.  Quietly, Corbett sits down.  Clutching the
rifle, Eric sits on the floor and glares at Corbett.
					
					CORBETT
			(softly)
			Does he have people?
					
					ERIC
			(after a beat)
			A daughter in Oregon.
					
					CORBETT
			Send him down to her.  There's
			money in my duffel bag, back at
			his cabin.

Corbett's benign attitude is chilling.
					
					ERIC
			I better call in.

He turns the shortwave radio on.  It SPARKS and burns out.
The remainder of the liquor has been poured inside it.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Thought of everything, huh?
					

					CORBETT
			Surviving is what I know --
					
					ERIC
			-- Killing is what you know.
			(to Anne Marie)
			Pack some food while I prep for
			the flight.
			(off her look)
			I'm sure not gonna let him go.

Covering Corbett with the rifle, Eric handcuffs him to the
sturdy metal bracket of a wall unit.

54   EXT.  CACHE, ALASKA - (MOVING SHOT) - NIGHT

Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt
road.  The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light
from the town up ahead.

Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in
the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the
Arctic Circle.  Still, it's more animated than Devil's
Cauldron.  There are a hundred permanent residents, several
taverns and a three-store, fly-in shopping center.
								
								(CONTINUED)
54   CONTINUED:

Even though it's the middle of the night, people roam the
streets, drinking and socializing.  With only a couple feet
of snow on the ground, this is still summertime.  Under
storefront awnings, drunken INDIANS sleep on the concrete.

Viking Bob cruises the main drag, looking for the other
trappers.  He spots their jeep in front of a
dangerous-looking saloon called the "Bear Sign Inn."

ANGLE WITH VIKING BOB

as he parks and gets out of his station wagon.  He hears a
familiar VOICE around the side of the building.
					
					LEMALLE (OS)
			C'mon, girl, talk to me,
			negotiate with me...

55   EXT.  CACHE - ALLEY

Drunk, LeMalle stands in an alley with a bored, acne-scarred
Oriental PROSTITUTE.  He weaves and leers, his hand stuck
inside her blouse.
					
					VIKING BOB
			LeMalle.  We got a problem.
			Where's Mitchell?
					
					LEMALLE
			Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's
			inside, boring bastard...

Grumbling, Viking Bob separates LeMalle from the Prostitute
and drags him by the collar out of the alley.
									
									CUT TO:

56   INT.  BEAR SIGN INN - NIGHT

Meyerling's campaign posters cover the walls.  Many have
been pulled down and muddied underfoot by the drunken crowd.

In a booth covered with grafitti, Mitchell squints and works
on his scrimshaw.  LeMalle, somewhat sober, eats a plate of
muktuk -- whale blubber.  Viking Bob pours him more coffee.
					
					MITCHELL
			(to Viking Bob)
			...Ben never sent a signal.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Musta never got a chance to

			activate.  Wilder's aiming to
			take him to Fairbanks, we can
			count on that much.
					
					MITCHELL
			Meaning he'll need a plane.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Closest planes for hire are here
			in Cache.
					
					MITCHELL
			Hang on...
			(to LeMalle)
			Remember that Cessna we saw at
			the pumping station on the Haul
			Road?  Belongs to the guy they
			got patrolling the pipeline.
					
					LEMALLE
			There you go.  Wilder's always
			chummy with the fuckin'
			Bambi-lovers.
					
					VIKING BOB
			It's a long shot.
					
					MITCHELL
			You got a better idea?

57   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAWN

Wisps of light cut across the cold blue sky.

Eric comes out of the Turtle, leaving the front door ajar.
He throws a knapsack of supplies into the back of the Scout.

58   INT.  THE TURTLE

Corbett's right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit.
Terrified about being alone with Corbett, Anne Marie
cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him.
					
					CORBETT
			How long have you been up north?
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(after a beat)
			Six months.
					
					CORBETT
			Can't be.  Too keen a sense of
			this place in your pictures.
								
								(CONTINUED)
58   CONTINUED:
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Six months this time.  I was born
			in the Aleutians.
					
					CORBETT
			Your people Alaskan?

Anne Marie doesn't want to talk to a killer, but Corbett is
so soft-spoken and charming that she answers despite
herself.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			My dad was a Navy doctor.
					
					CORBETT
			Knew you had no native blood,
			even with your dark hair.  Blue
			eyes give you away.  My wife had
			blue eyes.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Had?
					
					CORBETT
			She's dead.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Oh.
					
					CORBETT
			Had some good years.  Met her in
			'66.  She showed up one day in
			Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One
			Sunday morning, she marched into
			a bar and announced she was
			available as a wife to the
			highest bidder.  Didn't work out
			in three months, she'd return the
			money and leave, no hard
			feelings.
			(off Anne Marie's amazed
				look)
			My bid was eight thousand
			dollars.  Beautiful girl.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			How did she..?
					
					CORBETT
			I was gone, in September, laying
			traplines.  She went to our cache
			for some meat.  Got mauled by a
			bear.  Tore open her skull.

								(CONTINUED)
58   CONTINUED:  (2)
					
					CORBETT (Cont'd)
			Might've lived if she got help,
			but the exposed part of her brain
			froze.

Anne Marie shudders.  Smiling good-naturedly, Corbett looks
around, spotting the package Anne Marie's new dress came in.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			What about you -- why come back?
			Classy girl like you seems more
			suited to the finer things.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			That's why I left, moved to
			Washington.  When I met Eric I
			was doing day shoots -- products
			and fashion, mostly.  Pretty
			dull.  Eric was teaching college,
			and then he got the job with
			Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay
			together, so we talked them into
			funding some wilderness
			photography... and here I am.

As she's talking, the Turtle ROCKS slightly.  She looks out
the tiny window.

HER POV - THROUGH WINDOW

Eric is putting Wilder's body inside an enclosed storage
compartment built flush into the side of the Turtle.

BACK TO SCENE

Horrified, Anne Marie turns away.
					
					CORBETT
			You should know something.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			I don't want to talk any more.
					
					CORBETT
			Wasn't my intention to hurt
			Wilder.  I'm telling you the
			truth.  I liked the man.  I only
			meant to get loose... to survive.
			Your cheechako boyfriend better
			understand that.
			(beat)
			Listen, I've got some money put
			away --
								
								(CONTINUED)
58   CONTINUED:  (3)
					
					ANNE MARIE
			-- Don't ever think you can buy
			Eric off, Mr. Corbett --
					
					ERIC (OS)
			-- Cheechako?

Eric comes in, none too thrilled about Anne Marie chatting
with Corbett.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(translating)
			Outsider.

He carefully stuffs Wilder's magnum in his belt and ignores
Anne Marie's disparaging look as he does.
					
					ERIC
			(to Corbett)
			Let's go.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Wait a second.

59   INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE

Anne Marie leads Eric out of earshot from Corbett.  Eric
keeps a cautious eye on him.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Maybe you should drive him into
			Devil's Cauldron, let them decide
			what to do with him.
					
					ERIC
			(reassuringly)
			Fairbanks is a three-hour flight.
			I'll be back by dinnertime.

Realizing he's determined, she sighs and kisses him.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Be careful, okay?
					
					ANNE MARIE
			That's my line.
									
									CUT TO:



60   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK - DAWN

Eric and Corbett drive toward the deserted pumping station.
They cross over a prefabricated steel portal bridge spanning
a fast-running creek.

61   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

The wind whips through the shot-out wing window.  Corbett's
handcuffs are lashed to the seat frame with sturdy nylon
rope.

62   EXT.  PUMPING STATION

The pumping station consists of three corrugated steel
buildings.  The largest is an airplane hangar.

Just beyond the hangar is a narrow blacktop landing strip
running parallel to the Haul Road.

63   INT.  SCOUT - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric pulls up to the hangar.  Suddenly, LeMalle steps out
from behind the building.

64   EXT.  PUMPING STATION

LeMalle recognizes the International Scout.  He swings his
rifle up to stop it.

Eric slams it in reverse and SCREECHES back around the
hangar.
					
					MITCHELL (OS)
			Aim for the tires!

LeMalle FIRES as the Scout rounds the corner.  He hits a
fender, doing no damage.  Angry, he runs after the vehicle.

65   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric slams on the brakes and turns the Scout around.
					
					CORBETT
			Let me out and keep going.  They
			catch us, they'll kill you.

Eric doesn't need any convincing of that.  He tears out.

66   EXT.  PUMPING STATION

Mitchell runs out in front of them and BLASTS the front of
the Scout with his .45 Peacemaker.  Steam HISSES out of the
radiator.  Eric floors it and races past Mitchell, almost
hitting him.
								
								(CONTINUED)
66   CONTINUED:

Mitchell and LeMalle SHOOT at the retreating vehicle.  One
of the Scout's back tires gets blown out.

67   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric slows, shifts into four-wheel drive and continues,
driving on the rim.

68   EXT.  PUMPING STATION

Chewing an unlit cheroot, Viking Bob pulls up next to
Mitchell and LeMalle in the trappers' jeep.  They pile in.

69   EXT.  HAUL ROAD

Eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle.

70   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - (MOVING SHOT)

As the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge, it
disappears from sight over a hill.

71   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK

Viking Bob zooms over Feldspar Creek.  They come over the
rise, but the Scout still can't be seen ahead of them.

REVERSE ANGLE

The Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed,
below the Haul Road.  Above, the trappers speed past without
noticing.

After giving the trappers time to get around the next bend,
Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back
over the bridge.

72   INT.  SCOUT

Eric stops the vehicle.  He grabs a five-gallon gas can and
a piece of cloth from the back.

73   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK

The prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army
Corps of Engineers, left over from the building of the
pipeline.  Eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and
the honeycombed underside of the bridge.  He puts the rag
inside the spout of the can, lights it with a match and runs
like hell back to the Scout.



74   EXT.  HAUL ROAD

The trappers realize their quarry is missing.  Viking Bob
slams on the brakes and looks around.

75   INT.  SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric speeds away.
					
					CORBETT
			They'll still catch us.  All
			you're doing is pissing them off.

76   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK

The gasoline can EXPLODES, tearing the bridge couplings away
from the concrete abutment.

77   EXT.  HAUL ROAD

The trappers see the explosion behind them.  They turn
around and head toward it.

78   EXT.  PUMPING STATION - HANGAR

Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the
airstrip.

With the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs
loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar.

The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on
rollers.  Eric unlocks it and rolls it back.  Inside is a
Cessna 182, dusted with snow and ice blown through the
cracks by crosswinds.  Eric brushes the windshield with his
sleeve.

79   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK

The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge
burning and disconnected from the creek bank.

80   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA

Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his
handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope.

81   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK

Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge.  Loose from
the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board.  Below, the
water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable.



82   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA

Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over.  The starter is sluggish
from cold and lack of use.

83   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK

Viking Bob looks at the others, bursting with frustration.
He climbs into the driver's seat.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Get in.  We can jump it.

They hop in.  He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start,
REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward the
bridge.

As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle
under them.  With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbar
supports crumple.

The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomes
airborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the
pavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling in
space.

LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end
of the jeep onto solid earth.

84   INT.  HANGAR

Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing
strip.

85   EXT.  PUMPING STATION

The trappers drive up to where the Scout blocks their path.
They pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing
strip.

86   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

It picks up speed and takes off.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)

Below, the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads.
LeMalle points his carbine at it, but Viking Bob pushes the
rifle down.

87   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

Corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him.



88   EXT.  PUMPING STATION

Viking Bob watches, wide-eyed with fury.  Mitchell spits.
LeMalle punches the wall.  Then he turns and repeatedly
BLASTS the Scout, parked nearby, with his carbine.

89   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

Eric's knapsack, an emergency kit and several five-gallon
cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats.
					
					ERIC
			How the hell were they smart
			enough to find us?
					
					CORBETT
			Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm
			sitting in this plane and they're
			down there blowing me kisses.

Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the
southwest.  Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsure
of the controls.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Been driving long?
					
					ERIC
			I needed a pilot's license to
			take the job here, so I got one
			in six weeks.
					
					CORBETT
			That makes the flight more
			interesting.

Eric ignores the jibe.  He stays at 2,000 feet, making the
landscape all the more immediate.

Corbett stares out the window and broods.  He spots an open,
snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the
whiteness.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			See the blood?  Pack of wolves
			took down a moose.  Greedy,
			gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd
			kill the last wolf on earth,
			right in front of the President
			of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly
			predator, the wolf.
								
								(CONTINUED)
89   CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			Sounds like professional
			jealousy.
					
					CORBETT
			Hunting and trapping was a damn
			fine life.
			(beat)
			Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle,
			we were teams.  I'd always go
			with Mitchell.  Good man,
			Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry
			about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire
			a plane in October.  On the way
			to a dirt airstrip somewhere,
			we'd drop supplies.  We'd land,
			tell the pilot to come back for
			us a few days before Christmas.

ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)

While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the
instrument panel and scans the landscape below.
					
					CORBETT
			The idea was to get to the
			supplies before the bears did.
			Along the route we'd set our
			traps.  Made our year's living in
			three months.

Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above
the tree line.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Lot of times we didn't even have
			a landing strip.  We'd set down
			on a plateau, like that one
			there.  Yeah, that one's easy;
			you could glide right in...

Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the
door with his left foot.

The plane flies erratically.  With his right foot, Corbett
kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel,
jamming it on.

90   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of
emergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas is
instantly discharged.



91   INT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.

Eric rubs his neck, incredulous.  Corbett's move was too
fast and too outrageous.  In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS
to a stop.  Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.
					
					CORBETT
			Hope you got your money's worth
			on those lessons.

92   EXT.  CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the
plateau.  Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down.  The plateau
comes up fast.

The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the
wind.

It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits
the jagged granite under the snow.  It stops suddenly,
flipping tail over nose.

93   INT.  CESSNA

It rests upside down in the snow.  The men are dazed.

Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside
down, leaks gas.  In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.

Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg
gets caught in the tangled belt.  He pulls out a Swiss Army
knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the
seat.  Corbett pushes the passenger door open.  Panicking,
Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully
wrenching his ankle.

94   EXT.  CESSNA

Corbett rolls out into the snow.  With no time to grab his
supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage.  He and Corbett
crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the
plane.

A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine
and the Cessna EXPLODES.

WIDER

Eric tries to stand.  He cries out and falls into the
powdery snow, clutching at his ankle.
								
								(CONTINUED)
94   CONTINUED:

Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage.  But before he
can bolt, Eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat.  He
lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at Corbett's
midsection.
					
					ERIC
			Stay put!
					
					CORBETT
			You got the belly to look me in
			the eye and pull the trigger?

Eric cocks the gun's hammer with his thumb.
					
					ERIC
			Be no different than shooting a
			rabid dog.

The men face off for a tense moment.

Corbett smiles and zips up his jacket, dispelling the
tension.  Letting the hammer down, Eric looks back at the
burning plane.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Next time you want to kill
			yourself, don't include me.
					
					CORBETT
			I took the odds on getting down
			in one piece, and I made it.  Now
			we're in my territory.
					
					ERIC
			With light clothing and no
			supplies, this is nobody's
			territory.
					
					CORBETT
			You sound like the tourists.
			Know-it-alls who read about
			survival in a magazine.  Fuck
			you.  You won't make it off this
			mountain.

Corbett drops his facade of conviviality.  Eric is too angry
to be intimidated.  He takes the scarf from around his neck
and wraps his ankle with it.
					
					ERIC
			Let's go.
								
								(CONTINUED)
94   CONTINUED:  (2)
					
					CORBETT
			(re Eric's ankle)
			I'm not gonna carry you out of
			here.
					
					ERIC
			That's right.  You're not.
					
					CORBETT
			Look, take these cuffs off.  We
			need to work together.
					

					ERIC
			Forget it.

Eric holds his wristwatch up, points the hour hand at the
sun, counts forward to noon, and, accordingly, makes an
approximation of their direction.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Last time I checked the flight
			plan, we were forty miles
			northeast of Devil's Cauldron.
			Southwest is that way.  No sense
			waiting for a goddamn taxi.

Grimacing with pain, he gets up.  Clutching the magnum, he
shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking.  Corbett
frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his
arms cuffed tightly behind his back.

Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register
on his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest of
humanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett
enjoys the view.  And waits.

95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY

The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and
gnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow,
Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the
Arctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won,
snow-covered mile behind them.

Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy
tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding
mosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence

is itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two
thousand feet lower, the forest begins.  But here, on the
rock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as well
be in a desert.
								
								(CONTINUED)
95   CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			It'll be interesting, trying to
			build a fire without any wood.
					
					CORBETT
			Welcome to the environment, Mr.
			Ecology.  Out here, one mistake
			is all you get.

Determined and dour, Eric pushes on.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Why in hell you care enough about
			me to die taking me in?
					
					ERIC
			I don't plan on dying.

It's all academic.  The sheer magnitude of the surroundings
makes them feel they're the only people in the world.
									
									DISSOLVE TO:

96   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DUSK

The sun drops behind the mountains.  A wind whips up,
chilling the men through their clothing.  Eric tries not to
shiver.  He spies a small rock formation with a granite
elbow protruding from it, making an enclosed triangle of
solid rock.
					
					ERIC
			We'll stop here, dig out a snow
			shelter.
					
					CORBETT
			Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig.
			I'll have a little sit-down.

Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs near
the rocks.  Although he knows Corbett is testing his every
move, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Even in the drifts, this snow's
			too powdery to make a shelter.
			When you're done jerking around,
			reach down the back of my coat.

Eric approaches him suspiciously.  He puts his hand down
through Corbett's collar.  Something is stowed inside a
homemade flap in the lining of his coat.  Eric pulls out a
								
								(CONTINUED)
96   CONTINUED:

folded nylon tarp with twine threaded through corner
eyeholes.  He shakes the eight by eight orange tarp open...
									
									CUT TO:

97   EXT.  NYLON SHELTER - EVENING

Eric and Corbett have stretched the tarp out tent-style next
to the granite rock formation, making a minimal but
functional refuge from the cold night.

98   INT.  NYLON SHELTER

The men huddle inside the tarp.  Eric keeps a wary eye on
Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake.
Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it.  It's swollen to the
size of a softball.
					
					CORBETT
			Still quite a hike to Devil's
			Cauldron.
			(beat)
			Days.  A long stretch to go
			without sleep, my friend.  You
			can hide behind that pistol for
			now, but take your eyes off me
			long enough to sneeze --
					
					ERIC
			-- Turn around.

While poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly
unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the
granite elbow, then locks it back up again.  He's learning.
									
									FADE TO:

99   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - DREAM  - (AS IN SCENE 3)

Eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit,
following the predator's paw prints in the snow.  He peers
ahead and his prey becomes visible.  But it isn't a wolf,
it's Corbett.  His hands and face are covered in blood.
									
									END DREAM

100  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAWN

The sun peeks over the mountain tops, drenching them with
light and color.



101  INT.  NYLON SHELTER

The light hits Eric's eyes.  He bolts awake from a fitful
sleep.  Corbett sits, already awake, looking like he'd
uproot the rock to which he's chained if he could.  He waits
for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience
of a vulture.
									
									CUT TO:

102  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - SMALL VALLEY - DAY

Eric and Corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream
bisecting their path.  It's simple -- to continue, they have
to cross it.  Corbett takes in the scenery, in no particular
hurry.  Frustrated, but making dead sure he's always got the
drop on Corbett,  Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice.
					
					CORBETT
			Ice is too thin -- you can see
			the water moving underneath.
					
					ERIC
			We're not sitting here 'til
			November.  There's a cargo plane
			coming to Devil's Cauldron in
			four days, and I'm putting you on
			it.
					
					CORBETT
			We get wet, we freeze to death in
			a couple hours.
					
					ERIC
			I've been on ice like this when I
			was a kid, skating.  Spread your
			weight, keep moving.  Go on.

Corbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by
someone with a Master's Degree.
					
					CORBETT
			(gestures 'you first')
			Be my guest.
					
					ERIC
			(points .357)
			I'm right behind you.

Frowning, Corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches
across the fifteen feet to the other bank.

NEW ANGLE

He turns and, indeed, Eric is right behind him.
								
								(CONTINUED)
102  CONTINUED:
					
					CORBETT
			Wait 'til I'm across!

Eric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner.  He keeps
coming.  The ice GROANS and HISSES under their weight.

Corbett is three feet from solid ground.  He drops to his
knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the
way.

Eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across.  The ice
makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through
air holes.

Standing, Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric.

Eric crawls doubletime.  He makes it onto solid ground just
as the ice under him breaks off in a big, thin, clear plate.

CLOSER

Eric sits on some rocks.  Corbett glares it him.
					
					CORBETT
			Most dangerous thing in the
			world: A regular Joe, in over his
			head.  You trying to prove how
			tough you are for me, or for
			yourself?
					
					ERIC
			It wasn't my idea to crash the
			plane.
					
					CORBETT
			Let's camp.  There's grayling
			under this ice. I'll snare some
			for dinner.
					
					ERIC
			(standing)
			We've got another two hours of
			daylight.
					
					CORBETT
			Pushing it is flat wrong.  All
			you prove is your ignorance about
			breaking trail.

Eric is not convinced.   Grumbling, Corbett gets up and
takes the lead as they continue southward.



103  INT.  THE TURTLE - DARKROOM - DAY

Trying to keep busy, Anne Marie develops some prints in the
darkroom she's made from the front bathroom.  She glances at
her watch and sighs, her mind on Eric's overdue return.

104  INT.  THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE

Anne Marie comes out of the darkroom and hangs the prints up
to dry.  Outside, (OS), a car HORN blares a couple of times.
Grinning, she runs to the door.

105  EXT. / INT.  THE TURTLE

Meyerling's Dodge truck pulls up.  Anne Marie comes outside.
Her smile wilts when she sees it's not Eric.  As Meyerling
climbs the embankment to the Turtle, he glances at Wilder's
snowmobile parked alongside the Turtle.
					
					MEYERLING
			I've been trying to raise you on
			the shortwave for two days.

He pushes past Anne Marie and goes into the Turtle.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Have you talked to Eric?
					
					MEYERLING
			I have not, but I very much want
			to.  What do you know about the
			trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
					
					ANNE MARIE
			I was hoping you had some news --
					

					MEYERLING
			-- Get this straight: I'm the
			District Supervisor.  Whatever
			you do reflects on me.  It wasn't
			my idea to bring you people up
			here, but I'm stuck with you.
			You are absolutely not to involve
			yourself in any local disputes.
			Whichever side you take, you
			alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett
			is quite well-known in this
			region.  People admire him --
					
					ANNE MARIE
			-- Corbett's a killer.
								
								(CONTINUED)
105  CONTINUED:
					
					MEYERLING
			I don't care if Ben Corbett makes
			meatloaf out of nuns and babies,
			he's not your concern.
			Understood?

Anne Marie just glares at him.  Meyerling examines the
damaged shortwave.
					
					MEYERLING
			(continuing)
			What happened here?
					
					ANNE MARIE
			The radio's on the fritz.
					
					MEYERLING
			Where'd you say Eric is?
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Somewhere along the pipeline.
					
					MEYERLING
			What about that hotheaded
			marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he
			was in the middle of this mess.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Sam?  We haven't seen him.
					
					MEYERLING
			Really.  I thought maybe that was
			his snowmobile outside.
			(beat)
			By the way -- your truck also 'on
			the fritz?'
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(blanching)
			Why?
					
					MEYERLING
			It's out by the pumping station,
			shot full of holes.

Noting Anne Marie's distressed reaction to this news, he
crosses to the door.
					
					MEYERLING
			(continuing)
			Still nothing to tell me?
			(no reply)
			Suit yourself.



106  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY

Eric limps further down from the mountains.  Corbett keeps
pace in front of him and his magnum.  As their altitude
decreases, there is ever thicker vegetation.

Their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the
distance.  The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings
cannot be overstated.  Picture the most rustic, overwhelming
wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger.

NEW ANGLE - LATER

The men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a
sheer granite drop. The steep decline would be tough to
negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear.
Corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head.
					
					CORBETT
			Have to backtrack, find another
			way down.
					
					ERIC
			Forget it.  It would take days.
					
					CORBETT
			(assessing the drop)
			Going to be a bit of a challenge
			with handcuffs on.

Eric realizes he's right.  After some deliberation, Eric
cautiously approaches him.  With the .357 cocked and ready,
he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from
Corbett's wrist.  He then unthreads the nylon twine from
Corbett's tarp.

ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER

Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon
rope.  Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum
footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything.

Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path.
Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes
his gloves off.  Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold
and sharp.  His hands are soon numb and bloody.  Even in the
dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating.

He looks down and hangs on more tightly.  Sliding to level
ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger.
Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks.  Eric
is right above him.
								
								(CONTINUED)
106  CONTINUED:

Suddenly, Corbett's foot slips.  His right hand
instinctively goes for a hold.  The dangling handcuffs snare
on a protuberance, knocking him off balance.

The fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air.
Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his
leg, giving Corbett something to grab.  Corbett takes hold
of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock
wall.  Adrenaline screams through Eric's system.

Corbett looks up at Eric.  A careless move will send them
both tumbling.  Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits
for the worst.

After a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go
of Eric's foot.  He continues his descent.  Eric lets out
his breath and tries to swallow.  His mouth is as dry as the
granite.
									
									CUT TO:

107  EXT.  TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY

Handcuffed again, Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the
top of some foothills.  Now and again he glances behind,
gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment's
carelessness.  Around them there is heavy vegetation now --
snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twisted
thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through.
Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are coming
down from the north.

But below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like the
hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward.
The combination of altitude and latitude creates an
amazingly sharp topographical dividing line.  Within a few
thousand yards, the landscape abruptly changes from scrub
brush to thick coniferous forest.
					
					CORBETT
			Better get into those trees
			before that squall blows down.

Then, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the
foothills.

Just ahead, two enormous bull moose are fighting.  They ram
each other with six-foot-wide antlers.

Corbett stares, transfixed, admiring.
					
					CORBETT
			You talk about ecology -- there
			it is.
								
								(CONTINUED)
107  CONTINUED:

Eric turns, surprised at Corbett's unabashed awe.

Catching the men's smell the moose bound away, and the spell
is broken.

108  EXT.  MINING SETTLEMENT - EVENING

Viking Bob, Mitchell and LeMalle head somberly back to
Cache.  They drive along a hydraulic gold mining sluice on a
nearby river and come into town.

As the trappers park their jeep, some MINERS greet them,
shouting over the ROAR of the water.
					
					MINER #1
			Where's Ben at?
					
					MITCHELL
			You'll want to hear about it with
			a drink in your mitt.
									
									CUT TO:

109  INT.  BEAR SIGN INN - CACHE - EVENING

Outside, a STORM rages.  LeMalle is drunk, but still able to
stuff himself with a thick steak.  Mitchell drums his
fingers and listens to everyone talk.  With them at the bar
are the Miners, LOGGERS, CAT SKINNERS (bulldozer drivers)
and some leathery WOMEN.
					
					MINER #1
			...Figures, Corbett getting
			hauled off by a Federal marshal.
			God almighty, how I hate the U.S.

			We should pass a hat.  Send
			Corbett a few bucks.  We owe him.

Someone's hat comes off.  It quickly gets filled with bills.
					
					MINER #1

NEW ANGLE

Viking Bob hurries in and whispers something in Mitchell's
ear.  Mitchell shoots LeMalle a look and gets up.  The
threesome hastily exit, leaving behind the hat full of
money.


110  INT.  BEAR SIGN INN

Viking Bob, Mitchell and LeMalle stand in a quiet corner
near the front door.
					
					VIKING BOB
			I called the cops in Fairbanks,
			see when Ben is standing trial.
			They don't know shit about Ben or
			Wilder!
					
					LEMALLE
			Get the fuck out of here.
					
					VIKING BOB
			It's a three-hour flight.  They

					LEMALLE
			Maybe they went back to Devil's

					MITCHELL
			Naah, Wilder knows we got friends

					VIKING BOB
			That plane might've been to throw

110  CONTINUED:
					
					LEMALLE
			Wilder still woulda made

			Ben musta got loose.

			Okay, let's backtrack, try to

			Wilder's buddies with?
					
					MITCHELL
			(smiles)
			We were just talking about him.

111  EXT.  FOREST - CAMPSITE PREPARATION MONTAGE - EVENING

The STORM brings gusting winds and below-zero temperatures.
Eric and Corbett move through the storm in slow motion.
Both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common
enemy.  The snow and wind cut through their clothing like
razors.  They poke around for dead wood with which to make a
fire.  The trees are small and healthy; little is found.
					
					CORBETT
			(shouts over WIND)
			Just gather birch.  It'll smoke
			like hell, but it'll burn green.

Awestruck by the intensity of the storm, Eric tears branches
from birch trees and piles them in Corbett's handcuffed
arms.

They hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree
trunks, FLAPPING violently in the storm.  Hunching against
the wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his
pocket for some precious matches.  His fingers are so cold
he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.

Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding his
hands inside his coat.  He pulls them out and quickly takes
the remaining matches from Eric.

Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a match
between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it.  He holds
the flame next to the kindling.  It doesn't catch fire
immediately.  Corbett lets the match burn out against his
fingers.  He tries another match.  This time, a flame takes
hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.

On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire.
Eric can't control his shivering.  He gets on his knees next
to Corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the
wind.  Corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame, not

111  CONTINUED:

to grow.  Relieved, Eric and Corbett look at each other with
a glimmer of a grudging mutual respect.

The fire, now unattended, is smoky as Corbett predicted, but
burns along nicely.
									
									END MONTAGE

112  EXT. / INT.  NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT

Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter.  The STORM
rages outside.  Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato,
reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dinner.

Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
to a small animal burrow outside the shelter.  A squirrel
sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.

Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce.  Eric grimaces as
Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's SQUEALS (OS)
abruptly cease.

113  INT.  NYLON SHELTER

Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside.
					
					CORBETT
			I need your pocket knife.
			(Eric hesitates)
			I have to eat, too.

After a beat, Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss
Army knife and pushes it with his foot to Corbett.  Smiling,
Corbett admires the fancy knife.  Then, BELOW FRAME, he
skins and guts his catch.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Damn lucky this storm didn't blow
			down when we were on those
			baldheaded mountains.  It
			continues, we better stay put.
					
					ERIC
			It could blow over tomorrow, too.
					
					CORBETT
			I'm still figuring: You're either
			real brave or real dumb.
								
								(CONTINUED)
113  CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			I just want this over with.
					
					CORBETT
			(laughs)
			Where in hell Meyerling dig you
			up?
					
					ERIC
			You know Meyerling?
					
					CORBETT
			Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss
			your ass with precision if
			there's a vote in it.


Corbett eats the squirrel Eskimo-style.  Raw.  He uses the
knife like a native, too, holding the meat in his teeth,
then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice.
Eric stares, disgusted.  Off his look:
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Always eat your meat raw when the
			weather's cold.  Does you more
			good, long as the entrails look
			clean.

Corbett uses snow and the squirrel's fur to wipe the blood
from his face, then wipes the knife off and lays it, open,
next to his leg.
					
					ERIC
			I'll hold onto that.

With a wry smile, Corbett pushes it back over to Eric.
While Eric eats his dinner, Corbett listens to the STORM and
watches him eat.
					
					CORBETT
			Sure love to know where you fit
			in up here.
					
					ERIC
			I'm here to do my job.
					
					CORBETT
			You want to fool yourself about

Corbett smiles -- maybe he's beginning to understand Eric.
					
					CORBETT
			Folks come to Alaska for a real
			short list of reasons:  Money.
			Adventure.  Solitude.  Those
			cover most everyone.  But
			frontiers also draw another type
			of man.  One with a demon in his

			it to rest.
					
					ERIC
			Yeah?
					
					CORBETT
			Yep.  Sometimes they do, but
			usually they end up crazy or
			dead.

Eric ponders Corbett's words as he eats.

114  INT.  THE TURTLE - NIGHT

Anne Marie is frantic with worry.  She has the AM/FM RADIO
on for company.
					
					RADIO (VO)
			...This is "Tundra Topics" on
			KFAR.  Remember, as the nights
			get longer, be sure to stay on a
			regular sleep schedule.  The
			depression from the coming of
			winter that doctors call
			'Seasonal Affective Disorder' --
			or 'Arctic Blue' to us lay folk
			-- is preventable.

Anne Marie tunes the radio to "Pipeline of the North" on
KIAK.
								
								(CONTINUED)
114  CONTINUED:
					
					RADIO (VO)
			(continuing)
			...John Byers was hospitalized in
			Fairbanks today for an infection
			in an abscessed tooth.  Mr. Byers
			had a toothache and attempted to
			remove the tooth himself with a
			pair of pliers...

Suddenly, a BUMP rocks the Turtle.  Someone is outside.
Startled, Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the
window.

No sign of a vehicle or a person.  As she pulls on her
parka, she glances at the big rifle leaning against the
wall, but doesn't touch it.

115  EXT.  THE TURTLE

Her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the Turtle.  Anne
Marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead.

NEW ANGLE

A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around, attracted by the smell of
fresh carrion -- Wilder.  Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred
pounds, it's used to having its way.  Right now, it's
hungry.

With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture
the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the

utility compartment.  The bear pokes its head inside, and
Wilder's body slumps out into the snow.  The bear pushes at
the corpse with its snout.  Salivating, it prepares to dig
in.

Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT.
Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked
against the side of the Turtle.  She inches toward it.
Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly.

Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the
snowmobile ignition keys.  They're not there.  She feels
around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road
flares.

Anne Marie IGNITES the flares.  They illuminate the area
with an eerie reddish glow.  She YELLS at the bear, wields
the flares like Excalibur and moves forward.

The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation
meal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the
threat.  As Anne Marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind
legs to its full height to meet the challenge.
								
								(CONTINUED)
115  CONTINUED:

Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear.  It grunts when
the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards.  Anne Marie
throws another flare.  With a ROAR from hell, the bear
charges.  Anne Marie falls back.  Still holding the last
flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the Turtle.

ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE

Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's
pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground.  The bear
swipes at her, its huge paw inches away.  Anne Marie jabs at
the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more
quarrelsome.

She twists around, looking for a defense.  Above her is the
cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the
Turtle's electrical system.  She tugs at it, but it won't
budge.  The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet
snout.  Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a control
valve:
					
					?  DANGER!!
					
					?  BLACK WATER
					
					?  UNTREATED SEWAGE

Grimacing, she tries to turn the valve.  After much effort,
it SNAPS and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage.

WIDER

The bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff.  HOWLING
unhappily, it backs away, GRUNTING and SNEEZING.  Greatly
offended, its appetite gone, it lopes into the forest.

Anne Marie squirms out from under the Turtle and, gagging
from the horrible smell, pulls off her wet parka.
									
									CUT TO:

116  EXT.  WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

Wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie stands in the center
of three similarly-sized trees.  A FLARE supplies the light.
The big Remington rifle leans against the tree closest to
her.

She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a
sturdy tree branch twenty-five feet from the ground.  Then
she throws the other end over an opposing branch and
stretches the rope like a clothesline.
								
								(CONTINUED)
116  CONTINUED:

She attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the
first and throws it over a third tree branch, midway between
the other two.  She kneels and ties something BELOW FRAME to
the cross-length rope.

Pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope, she hoists
something heavy to the level of the branches.  The flare
burns out, plunging the area into darkness.

Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and
nervously tries to LIGHT another flare.  As she does, the
forest seems closer, sinister, filled with lurking ogres.
Seized with an instinctual fear, she grabs the rifle and
runs back to the Turtle.
									
									FADE TO:

117  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAY

The storm has passed, leaving a fresh covering of powdery
snow in drifts like sand dunes.  Eric and Corbett trek
toward Devil's Cauldron through the ever-thickening forest.
Corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in
strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses.  Eric, using a
tree branch as a walking stick, still limps on his sore
ankle.  For the first time, he keeps the magnum stuck in his
waistband.
					
					CORBETT
			There's a cabin, maybe twenty
			miles south of here.
					
					ERIC
			(kneels to adjust his ankle
				wrap)
			Too bad we're heading west.
					
					CORBETT
			There's a snowmobile. Inside a
			day we could be on the Yukon.  I
			got money there.  Remember that
			five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be
			smart.  Take it and walk away.
					
					ERIC
			(bristling)
			You don't get it, do you?

Corbett takes advantage of Eric's poor peripheral vision
from the visor by kneeing Eric in the face.  Eric falls
backwards into the snow.  Corbett takes off like a
jackrabbit.  Eric spits out some blood, shakes the stars out
of his eyes and yanks the .357 from under his coat.
								
								(CONTINUED)
117  CONTINUED:

					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Stop!

Corbett bounds through the snow, dodging trees and
snow-covered rocks.

Eric squeezes off a SHOT, and is startled by the recoil and
the blast.  He scrambles to his feet and SHOOTS again.

Corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank.

NEW ANGLE - FOLLOW CORBETT

Corbett runs over a frozen stream, invisible under a cover
of snow.  Suddenly, the ice SHATTERS under him.  Corbett is
immersed in frigid, waist-deep water.  He gasps from the
sudden temperature drop.

ERIC

hobbles after him, CUSSING bitterly to himself.

CORBETT

crawls to solid ground.  Disoriented from the shock to his
system, he rolls over to catch his breath.

WIDER

Eric appears over a snowbank.

Corbett tries to run, but his frozen, waterlogged legs feel
like pig iron.  Stumbling and panting, he looks for a safe
place to cross the stream.  Eric easily catches up to him.
Corbett sits in the snow, shivering.  He looks up as Eric
trots over.

Eric glares at Corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek.
					
					CORBETT
			Nothing personal.  Just wanted to
			see what you'd do.

Noticing Corbett's sopping legs, Eric becomes furious.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Have to get these wet things off.
					
					ERIC
			You're not going to slow us down!
			Keep moving!
								
								(CONTINUED)
117  CONTINUED:  (2)
					
					CORBETT
			Inside of three hours you'd be

Fuming, Eric helps Corbett up.

118  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - EVENING

The sun sinks below the horizon, creating across the
mountains a spectacular show of color and shadows.  The wind
HOWLS.

119  INT.  NYLON SHELTER

Eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter.  Corbett's
pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it.  He
huddles under the tarp, covered by his coat, drowsy and
listless.
					
					ERIC
			Stay awake!  You want to go
			hypothermic?
					
					CORBETT
			If that means freeze my balls
			off, no thanks.
			(yawns)
			I'll be okay.

Eric examines him.  Corbett's skin is white and rigid, his
lips are pale blue.  He scowls at Eric.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Told you I'm fine!
					
					ERIC
			(holds up three fingers)
			How many do you see?
					
					CORBETT
			(irritable)
			What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
					
					ERIC
			You don't feel cold?
					
					CORBETT
			It's a spring day...

He starts to doze off.  The shivering he's been repressing
now racks his body.  Eric sits him up, closer to the fire,
and puts his own parka over Corbett's shoulders.  With his
foot, Eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to
								
								(CONTINUED)
119  CONTINUED:

Corbett's legs.  Eric rubs his arms and hands, but it isn't
enough.  Eric loathes the specter of death, even Corbett's.
He shakes him, trying to keep him awake.
					
					ERIC
			Wake up, goddammit!  You've got
			classic hypothermia --
			crankiness, fatigue, can't feel
			your coldness.  Worst thing you
			can do is fade out.

Corbett is headed someplace far away.  Sighing, Eric turns
him so his back faces the fire.  He unbuttons Corbett's
shirt, then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across Corbett.
Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice.  Corbett's
teeth chatter.  He's completely unconscious.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			One more thing -- this doesn't
			mean we're going steady.

DISSOLVE TO:

Later, Corbett rests fitfully.  It could go either way.
Eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it
lively.

DISSOLVE TO:

It's night.  Some color has returned to Corbett's skin.
Eric turns as Corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of
his shirt.  His eyes open.  He tries to sit up, but he's too
weak.
					
					ERIC
			Stay still.
					
					CORBETT
			Where's my ELT?
					
					ERIC
			Emergency transmitter?  All your
			gear is back at Wilder's.
					
					CORBETT
			You got one?
					
					ERIC
			It was blown up with the plane.
					
					CORBETT
			Too bad.  We'd be out of here in

Corbett smiles.

			I'm hungry.  Go kill me some

			An appetite.  Maybe you won't die

					CORBETT
			Hate to disappoint you.

120  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - NIGHT

The AURORA makes a dazzling display in the cold clear sky.
Below, the only light on the endless expanse of dark earth
comes from the Turtle.

CLOSER

Flashlight in hand, wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie
refuels the generator.  Something catches her eye --

ANNE MARIE'S POV

In the distance, headlight beams jostle along the Haul Road.

BACK TO SCENE

Anne Marie caps the diesel fuel can and stows it away.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(grinning)
			It's about time...

She hurries back into the Turtle.



121  INT.  THE TURTLE

Anne Marie brushes her hair and makes herself presentable.

122  EXT.  THE TURTLE

The vehicle gets closer.  It's the trappers' jeep.  It slows
and parks on the Haul Road next to the Turtle.

123  INT.  THE TURTLE

Anne Marie peers out the window.  She gasps as she
recognizes the jeep.  Ducking from sight below the window,
she grabs Eric's coat and hurries into the rear module.

124  EXT.  THE TURTLE

Mitchell stays in the jeep.  Viking Bob and LeMalle get out
and walk cautiously toward the Turtle.

LeMalle stands midway between the jeep and the Turtle,
cradling his carbine.  Viking Bob goes up the steps.

125  INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE

Anne Marie remembers something she should've taken with her:
the rifle.  Too late.  She hears Viking Bob's FOOTSTEPS (OS)
come up the wooden stairs outside.

126  EXT.  THE TURTLE

Viking Bob knocks on the front door.  He peers through the
sheer curtain on the window, into the front module.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Hullo?

He shrugs to the others, then tries the door.  It's
unlocked.

Mitchell gets out of the jeep, spits and follows the others
in, his hand close to the Colt Peacemaker strapped to his
leg.

127  INT.  THE TURTLE

Anne Marie climbs out a window in the back.  She closes it
behind her just as Viking Bob pokes his head in the rear
module.

The trappers snoop around, noticing that the coffee pot is
still warm, etc.  The emptiness is ominous.  LeMalle picks
up the big Remington bear rifle.  He opens the breech to
determine if it's loaded, and sniffs the barrel to see if

127  CONTINUED:

it's recently been fired.  Viking Bob notices the damaged
radio.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Somebody left in a big hurry.
			(to LeMalle)
			Check outside.

128  EXT.  THE TURTLE

LeMalle goes outside and shines his flashlight around.

NEW ANGLE

In the back, Anne Marie drags an evergreen tree branch
behind her to cover her tracks in the snow, then climbs into
the utility compartment where Wilder's body was stored.

A moment later, LeMalle comes around the corner.  He notices
bear tracks and scat from the prior night's visit.
					
					LEMALLE
			(calls out to others)
			Grizzly sign.  Looks fresh.

Viking Bob and Mitchell converge with LeMalle.  They point
their flashlights around, spotting footprints and marks
going off into the woods.

129  EXT.  WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE

Tense and silent, the trappers follow the marks.  A breeze
RUSTLES the needles of the evergreens around them.  They
stop at the point the footprints end.  A rhythmic CREAKING
above them makes LeMalle shine his light upward.

NEW ANGLE

The light REVEALS Wilder's feet swinging back and forth
above their heads.  His body is suspended in the manner of a
trail cache.  Viking Bob lets out a startled grunt.  He and
Mitchell shine their lights on Wilder's face.
					
					MITCHELL
			It's Sam Wilder!
					
					VIKING BOB
			Musta wanted to keep him from the
			bears.  If Ben killed him, he
			sure as hell wouldn't hang him up
			like this.
					
					MITCHELL
			Where's the kid?
								
								(CONTINUED)
129  CONTINUED:
					
					LEMALLE
			Who gives a husky fuck?  Where's
			Ben?

The trappers look glumly at one another.

130  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

Anne Marie jams herself behind a pile of her photo
equipment.  She stops as she hears the trappers' boots (OS)
CRUNCH in the snow past her and go inside the Turtle.

131  INT.  THE TURTLE

The trappers peel off their overcoats.  They look around at
the comfortable surroundings.
					
					MITCHELL
			I should get me a job with an oil
			company.

He sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving
tools out on the coffee table.  LeMalle helps himself in the
well-stocked larder.
					
					LEMALLE
			I say we eat, torch this fuckin'
			thing, and move on.

LeMalle digs through the cupboards and comes up with a fresh
bottle of Scotch.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Go easy.
					
					LEMALLE
			Cool out.  I ain't about to get
			blasted.
									
									CUT TO:

132  EXT.  THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Flashlight in hand, gloriously drunk, LeMalle stumbles
outside.  He crosses to the jeep to grab a box of Twinkies
and, as long as he's at it, take a leak in a snowbank.
Bleary-eyed, he notices the damage to the utility
compartment inflicted by the bear.

He walks to it, stepping over the bear scat.  He marvels at
the size and depth of the clawmarks.
								
								(CONTINUED)
132  CONTINUED:
					
					LEMALLE
			Big mother musta wanted something
			real bad in here...

LeMalle tries the door, but it's jammed shut.  He tucks his
flashlight under his arm and gives another tug.  This time
the door cracks open.

CLOSER - HIS POV

He peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in.
A pair of eyes stare back at him.

WIDER

LeMalle jumps back, startled, and pulls out his knife.   He
tries the door again.  It WRENCHES open...

...He's looking at his own face in one of Anne Marie's
mirrored photo reflector boards.

Letting his breath out, LeMalle pokes around the equipment
in the compartment.  Ever larcenous, he pulls a few items
out, examines them, and, disinterested, leaves them in the
snow.  Doing so, he comes close to uncovering Anne Marie,
who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the
compartment.

Nothing in the compartment catches LeMalle's fancy.  Leaving
the door hanging open, he wanders away.

133  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

After he's gone, Anne Marie reaches over and closes the
door.  She can hear the trappers' (OS) CONVERSATION inside:
					
					VIKING BOB (OS)
			I know in my gut he was here.
			First light, we try to get scent
			of his trail.

Sighing, Anne Marie stuffs her hands inside her parka and
tries to get comfortable.  It's going to be a long night.
									
									FADE TO:

134  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAWN

Eric and Corbett wearily trudge through the woods.  Corbett
has the tarp wrapped around him for extra warmth.  As he
walks, he sniffs at one of Eric's Eskimo potato roots and
takes a tentative nibble.
								
								(CONTINUED)
134  CONTINUED:
					
					CORBETT
			Used to see the natives eating
			roots when I was a kid in Nome.
					
					ERIC
			Nome?  I figure you'd be a
			whaler, coming from there.
					
					CORBETT
			Told that's what our old man was.
			Planned on going to sea, me and
			Bob, 'til I read Jack London.
			Started trapping when I was ten.
			Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight
			bucks for a skunk, three for a
			muskrat.
			(off Eric's look)
			That was fine money.
					
					ERIC
			Killing wildlife not good enough
			anymore, so you go on to bigger
			and better things.
					
					CORBETT
			You got a knack for seeing things
			the way you want to see them.

They walk in silence.  Corbett tightens the tarp against the
cold air and looks at Eric.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Don't judge me.  You're a joke,
			coming here from a fucked-up
			culture, telling us what to do!
					
					ERIC
			Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's
			not too late to keep that from

					CORBETT
			(temper flaring)
			All you do is keep folks from

			they're meant to.  You don't

134  CONTINUED:  (2)

			What do you know about people?
			You live like an animal!  A
			savage goddamn throwback like you
			belongs out here, as far away
			from the rest of us as possible.
					
					CORBETT
			I'm real sad you don't approve of

He shoves Eric with his handcuffed hands.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Tell me what I should do,
			Professor.  You got all the
			answers.  I shouldn't hunt?
			Fine, I'll just phone up and have
			a salad delivered.

Livid, Eric backs away and knocks Corbett's hands away from
him.
					
					ERIC
			Don't push me..!
					
					CORBETT
			Cowardly bastard.  I'm in
			handcuffs and I still scare the
			piss out of you.

Eric smashes his fist into Corbett's face.  Corbett reels
back, more surprised than hurt.  Eric moves in, furiously
throwing punches.  Corbett plows his clenched fists into
Eric's midsection, doubling him over.  Gasping, Eric rams
his head into Corbett and they fall into the snow.

Despite the handcuffs, Corbett gets a few blows in.  They
wrestle fiercely, and Eric ends up on top of Corbett.  He's
about to throw another punch when Corbett looks up at him.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			First you save my ass, now you
			want to kill me.  Make up your
			goddamn mind.
								
								(CONTINUED)
134  CONTINUED:  (3)

Eric lowers his fist and climbs off of Corbett.  Corbett
gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence.

135  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY

Sunday morning.  Chimney smoke rises straight up in the
still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging
above the Devil's Cauldron valley.

A scratchy RECORDING of a HYMN ("We Will Gather at the
River") plays through a PA system, ECHOING forlornly off the
hills.  The PEOPLE of Devil's Cauldron walk through the new
snow to the center of the settlement.  Some, older Women
mostly, head for the dance hall, where the HYMN originates.

136  INT.  DANCE HALL

The Women SING along with the HYMN.  They face a shelf
holding the PA, a rusty TV and record player.  And, in front
of the shelf, an unmanned pulpit.

137  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON

The Men, including Neff, split off from their mates and go
into the Maqi.

138  INT.  MAQI

Neff joins some other Men sweating on benches in the
primitive steam bath.   Kenai sits closest to the fire.  His
thick glasses are steamed up, but he finally looks warm.
					
					NEFF
			Wilder's missing church services;
			you believe it?
					
					KENAI
			I just as soon he stay gone.
			Fool could've got us all killed,
			arresting Ben Corbett here in
			town.

139  EXT.  FOOTHILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY

Exhausted, Corbett and Eric climb across the last set of
foothills before the Devil's Cauldron valley.  The town
comes into view below them; faintly the MUSIC carries from
below.  Corbett looks at Eric and breaks the silence:
					
					CORBETT
			What makes you so sure my boys
			won't be waiting for us?
								
								(CONTINUED)
139  CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			They think you're in Fairbanks.
			If not, they still won't find you
			before the plane comes tomorrow.
					
					CORBETT
			Don't bet on it.
					
					ERIC
			I already have.
					
					CORBETT
			You don't know how true that is.

Eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down.
					
					ERIC
			We'll wait here until nightfall.
			No fire, no tarp.

Corbett sits next to him.  After a long moment:
					
					CORBETT
			Didn't mean it, you being a
			coward.  You're a lot of things,

			but chickenshit isn't one of
			them.
					
					ERIC
			Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you
			what scares me -- stumbling
			through life, like an ordinary
			jerk.  That's why I want to work
			on the front lines, where what I
			do means something.
			(beat)
			Soon as I got here, I realized my
			job was bullshit.  Oil company
			propaganda.  I was ready to
			leave, then I thought screw it,
			I'll outsmart them, do the work
			anyway.
			(beat)
			I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am
			fooling myself.  That's what I'm
			afraid of most of all.
					
					CORBETT
			Hell, I still get a knot in my
			gut every season, wondering how
			much longer I can go on.  No
			'Home for Retired Trappers' that
					-more-
								
								(CONTINUED)
139  CONTINUED:  (2)
					
					CORBETT (Cont'd)
			I ever saw.  We're like Eskimos
			-- get too old to be useful,
			we're left on the ice to die.

The men listen to the faint MUSIC echoing through the silent
foothills.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing; softly)
			My wife used to go to chapel on
			Sundays.  See her friends, 'cause
			I was away so much.
			(beat)
			Should've been home that day.
			She'd be getting dressed right
			about now...

Eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses
Corbett's face.

140  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAY

The trappers file out the front door.
					
					VIKING BOB
			My guess is he's loose and
			heading for Chukfoktulik.  He'll
			need supplies; that's the closest
			settlement without a lawman.

LeMalle carries his booty with him.  Viking Bob looks at him
disapprovingly as he puts the big Remington rifle in the
jeep.
					
					LEMALLE
			I ain't gonna leave a seven-
			hundred-dollar Remington behind.
					
					VIKING BOB
			(exasperated)
			What you gonna do with it?  Large
			bore's for shit on small game.
					
					LEMALLE
			Not in the right hands it ain't.

To demonstrate, he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip,
taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle,
shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession, and
blasting the door latch off the utility compartment.
								
								(CONTINUED)
140  CONTINUED:

Pleased, LeMalle slams back the bolt, ejecting a spent
shell.  He glances curiously at the door of the utility
compartment and starts toward it.
					
					LEMALLE
			(continuing)
			Thought that door was open last
			night...
					
					VIKING BOB
			Quit fucking around.  Get in.

LeMalle climbs into the back of the jeep.  With Viking Bob
driving, they pull away.

141  EXT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)

Grinning maliciously, LeMalle hangs the Remington out the
window as they retreat.  Taking careful aim, he SHOOTS.

142  EXT.  THE TURTLE

LeMalle's bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator.
The kerosene fumes EXPLODE, splattering BURNING KEROSENE on
the rear module of the Turtle.

The trappers don't slow down to enjoy the show.  Viking Bob
hurries on to more important business.

143  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away, Anne Marie
clambers out of the utility compartment.  Haggard and numb
with cold, she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously
devours the rear module.  Shielding her face from the
flames, Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between
the modules.  With great effort, she unbolts the coupling
bracket.

144  INT.  DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE

Anne Marie STARTS the engine, SLAMS it into gear, and
lurches the front module away from the burning rear module.
She shuts the motor off and, trying to hold back the tears,
watches the rear module BURNING.
									
									DISSOLVE TO:

145  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT

Bone weary, Eric and Corbett walk toward town, staying on
the outskirts to avoid being seen.  They look at one another
-- this moment seemed impossible not very long ago.  No one
seems to notice as they limp into Wilder's cabin.



146  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

It's dark.  Eric locks Corbett up in the holding cell, not
noticing that Corbett seems almost pleased to be there.  He
blocks the windows, pumps up the pressure on the white gas
lantern and heads back outside again.

147  INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE

Neff pries himself from his MTV to answer a KNOCK at the
door.  Eric hobbles in.  Neff notes Eric's weatherbeaten
condition.
					
					NEFF
			You don't mind me saying, Mr.
			Desmond, you look like hell.
					
					ERIC
			Have you heard anything from the
			girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
					
					NEFF
			Not a damn thing.  What's going
			on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all
			steamed up, looking for you.
					
					ERIC
			Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett
			with me --
					
					NEFF
			-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
					
					ERIC
			Back at my place... he, uh, broke
			his leg.

					
					NEFF
			If Corbett's men find out --
					
					ERIC
			-- I'm putting him on the plane
			to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
					
					NEFF
			Jiminy Christmas.
			(beat)
			What do you want from me?
					
					ERIC
			Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to
			my place on the Haul Road, tell
			Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit
			tight.
								
								(CONTINUED)
147  CONTINUED:
					
					NEFF
			I'll go at dawn.
					
					ERIC
			Thanks.  Don't tell anyone you
			saw me.

After Eric goes, Neff closes his door and bolts it.

148  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT

The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from
the north.  Another storm approaches.  The temperate days of
last week seem ages ago.

Kenai, Neff, and other TOWNSMEN batten Devil's Cauldron down
for the STORM.  Kenai is bundled up in the cold.  The men
tighten guy wires on the radio tower, windmills and caches;
bring firewood indoors; close off unused rooms in the
general store and spa.  Then Neff and Kenai split off from
the others.

149  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Via a catwalk, Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling
struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a
roof leak with pitch.  Neff is sullen from his conversation
with Eric. Kenai, however, is smiling at Neff.
					
					NEFF
			Why the smirk?
					
					KENAI
			Bet I could make some money
			turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe
			more for lettin' him loose.
			(off Neff's flustered look)
			I was up in my cache.  Saw the
			Northland man come talk to you.
					
					NEFF
			You're out of your greedy goddamn
			mind.
					
					KENAI
			Corbett coming here stinks of
			trouble.  We should make the best
			of it before it turns around and
			bites us in the ass.
					
					NEFF
			Stay out of it.



150  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT

Eric stirs a pot of beans on the cookstove.  Corbett watches
from the cot in the cell.
					
					CORBETT
			Talk to that good-looking girl of
			yours?
					
					ERIC
			You broke the radio, remember?
					
					CORBETT
			(smiles)
			I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like
			a clever kid.

Corbett sits up as Eric hands him a plate of beans.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			You were real resourceful out
			there.  Got me thinking of this
			perimeter man, froze all his
			fingers one winter.  So he hacked
			the tips off and sharpened the
			exposed bones.  Gets along better
			than ever.  Yeah, maybe I
			underestimated you.
					
					ERIC
			I liked you better frozen.  You
			didn't talk so much.
					
					CORBETT
			You're damn lucky, glimpsing this
			country before it's ruined, gone
			for good.  You saw wonders you'd
			only dreamed of.  That alone
			makes you different than the
			sorry bastards back where you
			came from, because you have
			dreamt them.

Corbett sees he's hit a nerve with Eric.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing)
			Remember that demon in the gut?
			Sometimes it's nothing more than
			wondering if the so-called
			civilized life has bred the balls
			and brains out of you.  That's
			what you want out of this, isn't
			it?
								
								(CONTINUED)
150  CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			All I want want is you in jail --

A KNOCK at the door interrupts.  Eric lowers the flame on
the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the
cardboard in the front window.  Frowning, he cracks the door
open and slips outside.

151  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN

It's Neff and Kenai.  Neff looks guiltily at Eric.
					
					NEFF
			(explaining)
			He saw you and Corbett come in...
					
					KENAI
			Dixie's waiting at the infirmary.
			She'll put a splint on that
			injured leg.

Eric is skeptical of Kenai's concern.
					
					NEFF
			Don't let him fool you.  Real
			reason he's here is to buy
			Corbett's traps.

Eric looks at Kenai, then at Neff.  Neff nods that it's
okay.  As extra precaution, Eric handcuffs Corbett's right
wrist to the frame of the cot inside the cell.
					
					ERIC
			(to Kenai)
			Okay.  You can talk to him.  But
			I'll keep the keys with me.

152  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT

Outside the wind HOWLS.  Eric enters and walks into the
hallway connecting the bath partitions.  A hand grabs his
arm.  Startled, he turns around.

It's Dixie, wearing a threadbare flannel robe.
					
					DIXIE
			Earl says you get discount.
			Twenty-five dollar.

Eric shakes his head -- typical Kenai.  He gives her three
tens.  She smiles and leads Eric toward the "infirmary."
It's actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining
table and a first-aid kit.



153  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT


Neff paces nervously.  Corbett smiles at him and Kenai.
					
					NEFF
			(apologetically)
			Look, Ben, we don't want any
			trouble.  The kid's got the key,
			and besides, he looks edgy enough
			to use that magnum he's carrying.
					
					CORBETT
			Relax.  I'll get loose in time.
					
					KENAI
			Any traps you don't want, I'll
			pay cash money.
					
					CORBETT
			Guess someone should use them.
			Open the bottom drawer in
			Wilder's desk.  My kit's in
			there.  Might as well unload
			everything.

Kenai tugs on the drawer.  It's locked.  Undaunted, he
jimmies it open with a knife.  Neff groans.  Kenai goes to
throw Corbett the duffel bag, but Neff grabs it.  He checks
for weapons, pulling out a hunting knife.  Satisfied, he
hands Corbett the bag through the bars.

With his free hand, Corbett digs through his belongings:
clothing, freeze-dried provisions, jerky, paperback books.
He looks up and shrugs.

154  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT

Eric's ankle is in a resin cast.  His foot rests on a stool.
While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub, a
hot towel draped over his face.  Above him, on a wall
bracket, a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM.

The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in.  She impassively
checks his cast -- which is interesting, as she's now
wearing panties, clog shoes and nothing else.  Eric takes
the towel off his face and sits up, astonished.
					
					DIXIE
			I wash your back for you.  You
			will like it.

Before Eric can protest, the door OPENS again.  It's
Meyerling.  He snaps his fingers at Dixie to shoo her and
she scurries away.
								
								(CONTINUED)
154  CONTINUED:
					
					MEYERLING
			I hate to interrupt playtime, but
			why the hell are you caught up in

					ERIC
			Cut the shit, Leo.  I might need
			your help...

155  EXT.  CHUKFOKTULIK, ALASKA - NIGHT

Consisting of a handful of sod-roof cabins, mostly bars,
Chukfoktulik is a way station in the coniferous forest,
sixty miles southeast of Devil's Cauldron.

156  INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP

With the seats pushed back, LeMalle peels the town's lone
WHORE out of her parka.  He's got the motor running for
warmth.  Her gold tooth glints in the light from the
building next to them.  The locating screen on the beat-up
radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash GLOWS
phosphorescent green.
					
					WHORE
			They got nice beds upstairs,
			honey.
					
					LEMALLE
			I'm standin' guard duty.
			Besides, rather spend the room
			money on sloppy seconds.

Over the sound of LeMalle's exertions there begins an
insistent succession of BEEPS.  The Whore looks over
LeMalle's shoulder at the locating device.
					
					WHORE
			Hey, Tiger --

LeMalle turns and immediately loses interest in the Whore.
Pushing her off of him, he blows the jeep's HORN three
times.

157  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT

Eric and Meyerling are in the middle of an argument.
					
					ERIC
			...I won't let a killer walk!
								
								(CONTINUED)
157  CONTINUED:
					
					MEYERLING
			Alleged killer.
					
					ERIC
			What does this matter to you?
					
					MEYERLING
			(sneering)
			You can't see past your lousy
			little assignment, sniffing
			around the pipeline.  The few
			voters there are in this district
			look up to Corbett, and I'm not
			about to alienate them.
					
					ERIC
			I should release Corbett because
			you want some votes?
					
					MEYERLING
			This miserable wilderness is a
			state of the union.  Policy's
			made here the same way as in the
			civilized world: at the ballot
			box.  That's the beauty of it --
			these icebox cowboys are living a
			century too late.  Get them on
			your side, it's like buying
			Manhattan for beads.  With a
			handful of votes you control the
			greatest frontier since white men
			stumbled onto the New World.
					
					ERIC
			Some day these people'll wake up,
			and you'll be the first one
			they'll run out of here.

Eric's attention turns to a rhythmic INTERFERENCE on the TV
screen.  There are three short bursts, followed by three
long bursts.  Something about it is very familiar.
Scowling, he sits up.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Shit...
			(to Meyerling; distracted)
			Do what you have to.  So will I.

Eric climbs out of the water and pulls his pants on.



158  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT

Kenai sorts through the tangle of Corbett's traps.   The
door bursts open and Eric hobbles in.  Gun drawn, Eric
unlocks the cell door.  He rips Corbett's shirt open.
Looking around, he sees Corbett's duffel bag sitting by the
cot.  Digging through it, he finds at the bottom of the bag
an ELT with a small red LED flashing on it.

Furious, he flings it against the wall, smashing it.


159  INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP - CHUKFOKTULIK - NIGHT

The green dot on the screen and rhythmic BLEEP go suddenly
dead, just as Viking Bob and Mitchell run up to the jeep.
					
					LEMALLE
			Northwest.  Devil's Cauldron.

LeMalle dumps the half-naked Whore out onto the snow.
Viking Bob starts the jeep and they roar off.

160  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT

Eric shoves Kenai and Neff out the door.
					
					NEFF
			What's wrong?
					
					ERIC
			Just stay out of my face until
			I'm gone!

He slams the door.  Corbett smiles his Cheshire smile.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing; picks up ELT)
			Emergency transmitter?  What
			happened to signal mirrors or
			two-tone smoke fires?
					
					CORBETT
			Lets us watch each other's backs

			messed me up this time was
			getting arrested in the baths.
			ELT was in my duffel bag, not
			around my neck where it should've

			No way they'll find you on a

160  CONTINUED:

161  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAWN

Fat, dry snowflakes pour through the still air.  Gloomy
clouds hang immediately overhead.  Visibility is ten feet;
the temperature is below zero.

162  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

It's 5:30 AM.  Sitting at Wilder's desk, Eric pries the tops
from some bullets and dumps the gunpowder into a styrofoam
cup. He rings the top of the cup with bluetip matches, then
seals it with masking tape.  Watching him from the cell,
Corbett smiles.
					
					CORBETT
			Flashbomb, eh?

Eric doesn't answer.  He pulls on a heavy overcoat of
Wilder's.  Putting the unused bullets back in Wilder's desk,
Eric finds Corbett's .44 magnum.  He puts it and some
speedloaders full of .357 hollowpoints in his pockets.

163  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - MONTAGE

Eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of
the early hour and heavy snowfall.  He paces out several
circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at
the edge of town, pausing now and again along the way.

He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby, so he
stands motionless in the snow.

Bundled in wool blankets, Kenai trundles down to his
outhouse.

After Kenai passes by, Eric sneaks inside the spa.  He
climbs up into the catwalk.

As Kenai goes back to his cabin, he notices that the antique
bear traps on display in front of the general store are
missing.  Suddenly, Eric grabs him and pulls him into the
spa doorway.
									
									END MONTAGE



164  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric's unexpected appearance startles Kenai.
					
					ERIC
			I need to rent a cabin.
					
					KENAI
			What's the problem with Sam
			Wilder's place?
					
					ERIC
			Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
					
					KENAI
			Pretty clever:  If the trappers
			got that signal beacon and get
			here in time, Sam's is the first
			place they'll look.  They may
			figure you're waiting for an
			airplane, so you can't stay in
			the shack by the airstrip.  Last
			place they'd expect you is on the
			far side of town.
			(shakes his head)
			I can't afford any trouble --
					
					ERIC
			(takes out all his cash)
			-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And
			if you or anyone else will back
			me up on this --
					
					KENAI
			(grabs money)
			-- Forget it.  And try not to
			bleed on my throw rugs.
			(walks away, then turns
				back)
			Why do this?
					
					ERIC
			If you have to ask, you wouldn't
			understand.

NEW ANGLE

Outside, there is the high-pitched WHINE of a snowmobile
(OS) driving into town.  Eric cautiously follows the SOUND.

165  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - CLOSE ON ERIC

He listens as the vehicle cuts across town toward Neff's
house.  The snowfall is too thick to see who it is.  Eric

165  CONTINUED:

moves in as close as he dares.  The ENGINE stops (OS) and
FOOTSTEPS crunch up Neff's driveway.

WIDER ANGLE - NEFF'S HOUSE

A person in a hooded parka stands on Neff's stoop, about to
knock.  Magnum drawn, Eric suddenly appears from the curtain
of falling snow.  He shoves the person against the side of
the house.

NEW ANGLE

It's Anne Marie.  She gasps.  Seeing Eric, she's more angry
than relieved.  Eric puts the gun back in his waistband.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Eric!  Why aren't you in
			Fairbanks?

He pulls her away from Neff's doorstep.  Her anger
dissolving, she wraps her arms around him.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(continuing)
			Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four
			days!  I thought you were dead,
			or worse.
					
					ERIC
			You can't stay here.  Go back to
			the Turtle.  I'll meet you back
			there in a few hours.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(stung by his coolness)
			What's going on?
					
					ERIC
			I'll tell you everything later.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Where's Corbett?
					
					ERIC
			Here.  A transport plane is due
			at eleven.  Once I put him on it,
			it's all over.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			So what's the problem?
								
								(CONTINUED)
165  CONTINUED:  (2)
					
					ERIC
			There isn't one, unless Corbett's
			men get here before the plane
			does.

Anne Marie grasps the situation with a sickening clarity.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Let the people here handle it.
			It's their marshal Corbett
			killed!

CUTAWAY - NEFF

has been eavesdropping on the conversation through his
window.  The news about Wilder stuns him.

BACK TO SCENE
					
					ERIC
			Please, Anne Marie, you being
			here only complicates things.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			I'm staying.

Eric knows she won't relent.
					
					ERIC
			Take the snowmobile, park it
			behind Wilder's cabin.

Sighing, she STARTS the snow machine.  Most of her photo
gear is lashed to the saddlebags.  As she pulls away, Eric
limps back to Neff's house and knocks on the door.
			INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE

Shaken, Neff opens the door and lets Eric in.
					
					NEFF
			I was just on my way to your
			ladyfriend's, but I guess she
			found you.
					
					ERIC
			Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last
			night.
					
					NEFF
			I'm the one should be sorry...
			Goddamn Kenai, always out for a
			score.  I never should've let him
			go over there.
								
								(CONTINUED)
165  CONTINUED:  (3)
					
					ERIC
			I'd sure like that favor you
			offered a while back.

Neff gets a seasick look on his face.
					
					NEFF
			Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count
			on it turning this ugly.
					
					ERIC
			What are you talking about?
					
					NEFF
			Bastards killed Sam, you think
			they won't kill the rest of us?
					
					ERIC
			There'll be three, four men at
			the most.  I have some backup,
			nothing will happen.
					
					NEFF
			I'm real sorry.  In a while,
			you're gone from this country.
			But we live here.  No one wants
			to mix it up with those hombres.

Neff opens the door for Eric.
					
					ERIC
			(angry)
			You don't care enough about Sam
			to --
					
					NEFF
			-- Sam Wilder was my cousin.
			He's why I came to Alaska.  All
			his letters, saying what a
			paradise it is.  But me ending up
			dead won't do Sam a lick of good.

166  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN

Anne Marie waits in front as Eric hobbles up.  She looks at
his bad ankle.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			You're hurt.
					
					ERIC
			Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have
			to hurry.

He leads her inside.



167  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN

Corbett is calmly reclining on the cot in the holding cell.
					
					CORBETT
			Could've told you no one would
			help...

Seeing Anne Marie, he smiles.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing; to Anne Marie)
			Maybe you can talk sense into
			your boyfriend.
					
					ERIC
			Shut up!
					
					CORBETT
			(to Anne Marie)

			Either way, you better clear out.
			I don't want anyone innocent
			getting harmed.

This comment has the intended effect on Anne Marie.  Angry,
Eric throws Corbett a coat.  Corbett puts it on.  Reaching
through the bars, Eric cuffs Corbett's hands together.
					
					ERIC
			We're moving.  Let's go.

As they exit, Corbett's sardonic look makes Anne Marie
shiver.

168  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a
beat-up color TV set, a cookstove and a half-drum heat
stove.  Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter
that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a
now-dry stream.

Eric checks his watch.  6:15 AM.  He bolts the door and
blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from
outside.  He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the
fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the
chimney.  Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb
waiter.
					
					ERIC
			You'll catch a chill by that dumb
			waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.
			(hands her the .44)
			Keep this pointed at him if I get
			preoccupied.
								
								(CONTINUED)
168  CONTINUED:

Anne Marie reluctantly takes the huge gun.  Trying to allay
her fears, Eric sits and brushes the hair from her face.
Corbett intently watches them.  Before he can say anything,
Eric shoots him a cold look.  Corbett stays quiet.

169  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A pall hangs over the town.  People know to stay inside.
Time crawls by.

In his house, Neff, for once, has his TV turned off.  He
tries to read and listens for sounds outside.

In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere.  All the stalls are
empty.

In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the
curtain of snow.  Dixie comes up behind him and puts her
hands on his shoulders.  He looks up at her, glum.

In Wilder's empty cabin, his belongings are scattered about
as if expecting his imminent return.

In the rental cabin, Eric checks his watch.  10:45 AM.

170  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR WILDER'S CABIN - DAY

The sound of a MOTOR grows in volume, then abruptly ceases.
The trappers' jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into
town.  It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a
woodpile across from Wilder's cabin.

The trappers get out of the jeep.  LeMalle has Eric's
Remington, Mitchell has his Peacemaker, and Viking Bob
carries LeMalle's old carbine.  Mitchell spits.  It's so
cold outside that the spittle freezes and CRACKS before it
hits the ground.

They fan out and approach Wilder's cabin.

ANGLE WITH TRAPPERS

The cabin comes more clearly into view as the trappers move
closer.  There is no sign of life.  Viking Bob gestures for
the others, now positioned on either side of the cabin, to
crouch down for cover.
					
					VIKING BOB
			(calls out)
			Ben?  Ben Corbett?

No response.  Carbine held at his hip, Viking Bob walks up
to the door and, with a mighty kick, BREAKS it in.
								
								(CONTINUED)
170  CONTINUED:

REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH WILDER'S CABIN DOOR

Viking Bob points the carbine at an empty room.  He notices,
however, Corbett's duffel bag on the floor of the cell.

171  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON

The trappers march through town like an advancing army,
looking for some sign of Corbett.  LeMalle stops to dig
through his pockets for some food.  All he comes up with is
the stump of a candy bar.  Viking Bob looks at him
impatiently.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Look, we pull Ben's ass out of
			the fire, I'll get you a whole
			damn crate of Snickers bars.
					
					LEMALLE
			(insulted)
			I'm right fuckin' here with you.

To prove his point, LeMalle trots from dwelling to dwelling,
looking through windows and letting himself in through any
unlocked door.  This proves fruitless, so he lets out a
frustrated YELL.  Pointing the Remington skyward, he lets
off a couple thunderous SHOTS that ECHO back off the
foothills.

172  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Hearing the shots, Eric pushes Anne Marie against the floor.
Cautioning her to stay put, he crawls to the window and
tries to see through the snowfall.  After a moment of
silence, from outside, not too far away:
					
					LEMALLE (OS)
			Ben!  Speak out before I torch
			every dump in town!

Eric points the magnum at Corbett.
					
					ERIC
			Answer and I'll shoot!
					
					CORBETT
			You kill me, you sign your death
			warrant.
			(re Anne Marie)
			And hers.



173  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

Viking Bob and Mitchell come running over to LeMalle.
LeMalle fires another couple SHOTS for emphasis.
					
					LEMALLE
			(calls out)
			You hear me?  Ben?
					
					VIKING BOB
			(to LeMalle)
			Ease off.  We do this my way.

He and the others strain their ears for a clue.
					
					VIKING BOB
			(continuing; calls out)
			Whoever's holding Ben Corbett,
			listen to me: we just want to
			know he's okay.  He is, nobody
			gets hurt.

174  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

His mind racing, Eric stares at Corbett.  Despite the
freezing temperature of the room, he's sweating.
					
					CORBETT
			They know I'm here.  I don't say
			something, they'll plow this town
			under.  You willing to accept
			that responsibility?

Setting his resolve, Eric drags Corbett to the window.  He
pushes the barrel of the magnum against Corbett's cheek.
					
					ERIC
			Say you're okay.  Tell them I'll
			kill you if they rush us.

Anne Marie bites her lip and tries to maintain a brave
front.  Despite the gun in his face, Corbett remains calm.
					
					CORBETT
			(shouts through window)
			Bob?

175  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

Hearing Corbett's voice, the trappers spin around, trying to
ascertain its direction.
					
					CORBETT (OS)
			Relax.  I got a nervous man here
			with a magnum up my nose.
								
								(CONTINUED)
175  CONTINUED:

The trappers follow his VOICE toward the rental cabins.
					
					VIKING BOB
			You in one piece?
					
					CORBETT (OS)
			I'm fine.  Look forward to seeing
			you...
					
					VIKING BOB
			Count on it.

176  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric pulls Corbett away from the window.  He shoots a look
at Anne Marie.  They're in a bind and she knows it.

177  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

LeMalle grabs Viking Bob's arm.
					
					LEMALLE
			(to Viking Bob)
			Sweet-talk won't get shit.
			(calls out)
			Choose it, asswipe -- cut Corbett
			loose, or soon as you come
			outside, I put a fuckin' bullet
			through your eye!

178  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric glances at Corbett, whose grim look certifies LeMalle's
boast.
					
					CORBETT
			Snow's to their advantage, kid.
			You can't see them, but soon as
			that plane comes, they'll sure as
			hell know where we're going.
			Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon.
			I'll give you that money and
			guarantee you'll walk away.
					
					ERIC
			Why offer a buyoff with your
			gunmen waiting outside?
					
					CORBETT
			The time has passed for men like
			them and me.  I know it.  But
			they're still fighting for
			survival, like cornered animals.
			That's why they'll kill you.
					-more-
								
								(CONTINUED)
178  CONTINUED:
					
					CORBETT (Cont'd)
			(smiles)
			Be rude to let that happen after
			you kept me from freezing back
			there.

Anne Marie tries to hide how tempted she is by Corbett's
offer.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(to Eric)
			He's right about the snow.  We're
			blind.

Eric sighs -- is she against him, too?  From outside:
					
					VIKING BOB (OS)
			Ben?

The trappers are obviously much closer.  Eric signals to
Corbett not to answer.

NEW ANGLE

Eric and Corbett face the window.  They don't notice as Anne
Marie quietly shimmies outside through the narrow dumb
waiter shaft to the back of the rental cabin.  Eric turns,
gasping as he realizes she's gone.  Corbett smiles
sardonically.
					
					CORBETT
			At least your girl had the sense
			to jump ship.  Too bad she's the
			only one small enough to fit
			through that dumb waiter.

179  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - FOLLOW ANNE MARIE

Using the cover of the snowfall, Anne Marie circles around
the outside edge of town toward Wilder's cabin.  She takes
some of her photo gear from the snowmobile.

180  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

Unaware of Anne Marie's maneuver, the trappers wait for a
response from Corbett.  None comes.  Viking Bob places a
calming hand on LeMalle's shoulder.
					
					VIKING BOB
			Just wait, we don't know what
			this guy's up to.  Ben'll let us
			know what to do.



181  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - ANTENNA TOWER

With a camera bag slung over her shoulder, Anne Marie climbs
up the metal antenna tower behind Neff's house on the edge
of town. She grits her teeth and fights back a wave of
vertigo. The ground disappears from sight, hidden by the
snow and fog.

Fifty feet up, she attaches her infrared video camera to the
tower crossbars and, using a length of coaxial cable, hooks
its RF output to the feedline of the community TV antenna.

182  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric looks at his watch.  10:55 AM.

183  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

A CRACKING twig behind the cabins gets the trappers'
attention.  Clutching his rifle, LeMalle goes to
investigate.

WITH LEMALLE

as he probes through the snow, listening.  He reaches the
edge of the woods and, finding nothing, returns to the
others.

NEW ANGLE

Anne Marie crouches behind a tree, twenty feet behind
LeMalle.  After a moment, she tiptoes back toward the rental
cabin.

184  INT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric and Corbett turn as Anne Marie's camera bag suddenly
drops from the dumb waiter shaft.  Anne Marie wriggles back
inside.  Before Eric can say anything, she puts her fingers
over his mouth.  She turns on the TV set and tunes it to
channel 3.

ANGLE ON TV

A fuzzy IMAGE comes into view.  It's Devil's Cauldron from
the vantage of Anne Marie's infrared video camera.  The
falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the
scene.  Buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes.
Heat-producing objects -- warm walls, chimney smoke, etc. --
are pink and red.  And there are three clearly-definable
human figures standing near the Maqi.  The trappers.

BACK TO SCENE

Corbett is amazed.  Eric smiles at Anne Marie.
								
								(CONTINUED)
184  CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			Your infrared camera?
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(nods)
			Technology in the wilderness.
			Only problem is talking to you on
			your way to the landing strip.
					
					ERIC
			I've got an idea.  We'll have to
			work fast.

He digs through Anne Marie's bag of equipment and supplies,
then stops and looks up.  Outside, there is an OS SOUND that
is felt before it is HEARD.  The cargo PLANE approaches in
the distance.

185  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

The trappers look at each other as the SOUND of the plane
grows louder.
					
					VIKING BOB
			There's what they're waiting on!
					
					MITCHELL
			(smiles tightly)
			They'll have to come right past
			us.

186  EXT.  RENTAL CABIN

Eric quietly pulls the door open.  Holding the pistol to
Corbett's head, he pushes Corbett out in front of him.

Anne Marie and Eric exchange a long look.  Fighting back
tears, she reaches up and touches his face.
					
					ERIC
			When you ran off, I thought you'd
			keep going 'til you were back
			home in Washington.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			My home is here.  With you.

He smiles.  Then he and Corbett are gone, lost from sight in
the snowfall.   After a beat, Anne Marie takes a deep breath
and slinks away in the other direction, toward the dance
hall.
								
								(CONTINUED)
186  CONTINUED:

ANGLE NEAR THE MAQI

The trappers wait, twenty-five feet from Eric and Corbett.
The DRONE of the plane grows louder.

ERIC AND CORBETT

start toward the airstrip.  Corbett sees a patch of bare
dirt and SCUFFS his feet in it.

ANGLE NEAR MAQI

The trappers turn to the SOUND, heard under the RUMBLE of
the still-distant plane.  Converging, they head in that
direction.  Suddenly, Anne Marie's VOICE booms through the
town:
					
					ANNE MARIE (OS)
			(over PA)
			They're moving toward you!

WIDER

Eric SHOOTS a couple times, then backtracks and pulls
Corbett behind one of the rental cabins.

Ducking the bullets, the trappers sprawl onto the ground.

187  INT.  DANCE HALL

Anne Marie has turned on the rusty TV near the pulpit.
While watching the infrared IMAGE of the action outside, she
holds the microphone wired to the old PA.

ANGLE - THE TRAPPERS

Viking Bob gestures to Mitchell and LeMalle to separate.
					
					ANNE MARIE (OS)
			(over PA)
			They're fanning out.

Angry, LeMalle BLASTS his rifle in direction of her VOICE.
					
					LEMALLE
			(to Viking Bob)
			Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck
			she seein' us?
					
					VIKING BOB
			Doesn't matter.  We know where
			they're going.  C'mon.

Stalking, anxious, LeMalle follows Viking Bob.
								
								(CONTINUED)
187  CONTINUED:


MITCHELL

splits off from them and looks for footprints in the snow.

188  EXT.  ALLEY

Eric pushes Corbett through a narrow pass between two
buildings in the center of town.  He walks in Corbett's
footprints.  Almost through to the other side, he suddenly
stops.  Pulling Corbett with him, Eric walks backwards,
still carefully placing each foot in an existing footprINT.
Corbett can't help but smile.

189  INT.  DANCE HALL

Watching the TV screen, Anne Marie sees one of the red blips
change direction and head toward her.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(into mic)
			One is moving back toward the
			cabins.

190  EXT.  DANCE HALL

It's LeMalle.  He crosses to Kenai's generator.  With a
well-placed rifle SHOT to its innards, he GRINDS it to a
halt.

191  INT.  DANCE HALL

The TV PICTURE disappears as the power dies.  Anne Marie
keys the PA microphone; it's dead, too.

192  EXT.  ALLEY

Eric and Corbett emerge from between the buildings.  Eric
backtracks toward the hot springs spa, now leaving an
obvious trail.

193  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric and Corbett go inside.  Eric pulls the door closed
behind them, but leaves it ajar.

194  INT.  KENAI'S HOUSE

The DRONE of the approaching plane is ever louder.  Kenai
stands and pulls on a succession of sweaters.  Dixie looks
at him.
					
					DIXIE
			Earl, it's crazy to go out there.
								
								(CONTINUED)
194  CONTINUED:
					
					KENAI
			I hear someone in the spa.

He straps on a holster under his sealskin coat.

195  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP - LONG SHOT

The big 4-prop plane is about to touch down on the far side
of the snow-covered airstrip.

196  INT.  DANCE HALL

Anne Marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside.

197  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

LeMalle follows the footprints to the door Eric left ajar.
He peers inside.

198  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

It's tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes
CREAKING.  LeMalle looks around.  The sound of a small DING
against metal above him gets his attention.

He sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him.
He finds a metal ladder, slings his rifle over his shoulder
and climbs up.  Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the
catwalk, he hurries across, holding onto the pipes for
balance.

LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool.  He ducks
to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling
to a dark corner below.  Suddenly, the twine snaps tight,
pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling.  The door
swings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk.  With a
yelp, he splashes into the water below.

NEW ANGLE

Hidden in the shadows, Eric drops the end of the twine and
rushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow.
					
					ERIC
			(to Corbett)
			That'll keep him out of the cold.

LEMALLE

climbs out of the central pool, soaked.   He pulls his wet
jacket off and furiously throws it down.



199  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric leads Corbett around the back of the spa.  A GUNSHOT
rings out nearby and a BULLET hits the wall above Eric's
head.

MITCHELL

has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow.  He
purposely SHOOTS over their heads so he doesn't hit Corbett.

ANGLE BEHIND HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric and Corbett crouch down and double back.   They are
once again swallowed up by the snowfall.

200  EXT.  ALLEY

Viking Bob follows their footprints in between the
buildings.  He continues to a point where they converge to
one set, then stop.  He smiles at the naivete of Eric's
ploy.  Looking at the boardwalk railing above, he assumes
Eric and Corbett have swung over it onto the iced-over
boardwalk.  Pleased with his deduction, Viking Bob continues
along the alley.

SNAP!  Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his
back in the snow.  Biting into his right calf is a huge
conibear leg trap.  In extreme pain, he struggles to lever
it open with the barrel of his rifle.

201  EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE

Corbett shoots Eric a dangerous look as Viking Bob's CRIES
carry though the town.
					
					ERIC
			He'll live.

202  EXT.  ALLEY

Hearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes
to Viking Bob's aid.  Between them, they manage to yawn open
the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg.  Viking Bob
tries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is
broken.  Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on.  In
agony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow.  He tears a strip
of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the
bleeding.

203  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Anne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip.
Suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle
lunges at her.  Stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped
								
								(CONTINUED)
203  CONTINUED:

in blankets and furs, his feet protected by sacks lashed to
them.  His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air.

Anne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from
him.  She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out.
Scrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle.
He comes at her again.  Anne Marie moves away and pulls the
.44 magnum out.  LeMalle stops and glares at her.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(gasping)
			Don't make me shoot.

She gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him.
LeMalle glowers menacingly.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			(continuing)
			We're going to Sam's cabin.  You
			can stay in the jail until this
			is over.

LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle.  Anne Marie
wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop.
					
					LEMALLE
			Want to chance it with that
			hog-leg?  You can't even hold it
			up.  Better drop me first shot,
			bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin'
			lungs out.

Taunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down.  Anne Marie is
paralyzed.  Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony
fingers around the stock of the Remington.

Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifle
close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  Anne
Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away,
leaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie lets
her arm fall.

204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN

Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the
worst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut
across open ground toward the airstrip depot.

205  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA

Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's
ransacking for things to wear.  Kenai turns, startled, when
he hears footsteps.  It's Neff and Meyerling.

			(after a beat)
			Dead.  Trappers killed him.

			Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was

			(to Meyerling)
			What about you, big shot?  Do
			something.  Who's side are you
			on, anyway?
					
					MEYERLING
			Hey, I thought you people loved
			Corbett and his wild men!
					
					KENAI
			This shoot-'em-up shit is bad for

					MEYERLING
			What about you, Neff?
					
					NEFF
			Well... two of the trappers are
			down already --
					
					MEYERLING
			(suddenly on the bandwagon)
			-- One left; three of us.  Let's
			finish it.
					
					NEFF
			What about Eric Desmond?
					
					MEYERLING
			I'll handle him.

206  EXT.  YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Through the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the
plane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the back
of the airstrip depot.

As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric
catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in
a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.
								
								(CONTINUED)
206  CONTINUED:

ERIC'S POV - REFLECTION

Peacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming
right for them.

WIDER

Eric takes out the homemade flashbomb.  He lights it, tosses
it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes.  It EXPLODES with a
muffled pop and a bright flash of white light.

Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes.  The flash
has temporarily clouded his vision.

Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and
waits for Mitchell to move on.

207  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his
shoulder stops him.  It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse
bleeding from his right shoulder.  Mitchell blinks, still
having trouble seeing.  LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet
and points in Eric and Corbett's direction.
					
					LEMALLE
			(whispers)
			Over there...

He hoists his Remington.
					
					MITCHELL
			(whispers)
			Hold it.  You might hit Ben.
					
					LEMALLE
			Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming
			at.
					
					MITCHELL
			Let 'em come closer first...

But LeMalle is too anxious.  He swings the rifle up,
left-handed, and SHOOTS.

NEW ANGLE

The bullet just misses Eric.  He panics and wildly returns
FIRE with the .357.

208  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Mitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets.
								
								(CONTINUED)
208  CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETT

as they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them,
nearby.  Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the
depot.  There is no further movement.

Eric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward
the depot.

209  EXT.  REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Reaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over
something.  It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the
wall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage.  Eric gasps.
Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell.  Mitchell pulls
him closer.
					
					MITCHELL
			Glad to see you're okay.  I told
			LeMalle not to shoot.
			(tries to smile)
			Had some fine seasons, didn't
			we...

Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies.
Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed.  Noticing the
scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's
pocket, Corbett picks it up.
					
					CORBETT
			(to Eric)
			Fifteen years on the trail with
			this man, I never saw him rise to
			anger.

Glaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood,
and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth.  Repelled, Eric
pulls back.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing; bitterly)
			Your first kill.  How does it
			taste?

Wiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.

WIDER

Then, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them.  Eric
stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the
padlock off the back door of the depot.  He pushes Corbett
inside.



210  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT

The pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and
removes his Walkman headphones.  Hearing LeMalle's
continuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed and
turns on his two-way radio.
					
					PILOT
			(into radio mic)
			Circle, this is BMY-955.  I just
			touched down in Devil's Cauldron.
			Nobody's here to greet me like
			usual, and there's gunfire.  I'm
			getting scarce.

With that, he STARTS his engines up again.

CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT

who turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing to
life OS.

211  INT.  CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT

The Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take
off.  He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenly
opens.

WIDER

Anne Marie slides onto the seat.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			You can't leave yet.
					
					PILOT
			It's my responsibility to get
			this aircraft out of here safely.

Anne Marie points the .44 at him.
					
					PILOT
			(continuing)
			You got to be kidding.
					
					ANNE MARIE
			Leave the engines idling.  Go
			back and open the side door.


Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat
belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment,
and obliges the little lady with the big gun.



212  INT.  AIRSTRIP DEPOT

The depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's
Cauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with
a corrugated steel roof.  Boxes, wood palettes and hand
dollies are piled haphazardly about.

Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes,
inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the
plane.

Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on.  Eric goes
for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and
Neff have come in the front door.  Kenai stomps his feet and
shivers.  Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps
forward.
					
					MEYERLING
			Nobody wants any more killings;
			we all agree to that, correct?
			(no one argues)
			That's good.  Now, Eric, you're
			gonna hand your prisoner over to
			us.
					
					ERIC
			Fuck you.
					
					MEYERLING
			This isn't your concern.  It's
			over, here and now.
					
					CORBETT
			(to Meyerling)
			Sure, when you put a bullet in my
			back on the way out.  Easier for
			all involved.
					
					MEYERLING
			Not a bad idea.  Face it, Ben.
			There's no room in Alaska for you
			any more.

Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of
Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish-
and bear-spears.
					
					MEYERLING
			(continuing)
			You're as antiquated as this
			shit.

Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.
								
								(CONTINUED)
212  CONTINUED:
					
					ERIC
			Keep back.
					
					CORBETT
			You're quite a piece of work,
			Meyerling.  The tide changes, you
			ride right along with it.

Eric looks at Neff.
					
					ERIC
			Neff, you know better than
			this...
					
					NEFF
			You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond.
			Step aside; stay out of it.

Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling.  Eric stands his
ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.

NEW ANGLE

Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and
furs dragging at his feet.  His right side is bathed in
blood.  Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down
dead.  In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the
massive Remington.

He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a
round into the chamber with his injured right arm.  Bracing
himself, he levels the rifle at Eric.

Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.

Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his
handcuffed hands, and hurls it.

There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.

LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear
stuck clear through his chest.

Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by
the muzzle blast.

NEW ANGLE

There is a moment of silence.  Corbett looks at the other
weapons near him, and then at Meyerling.  Threatened,
Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic.  Before Eric can do
anything, Meyerling FIRES.

The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.
								
								(CONTINUED)
212  CONTINUED:  (2)

With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his
grasp.  Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai
and Neff pull them apart.  Eric wrenches away from them and
scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Anybody moves and I'll shoot!

Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett.  Bleeding
from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.
					
					ERIC
			(continuing)
			Can you walk?
					
					CORBETT
			Wound's a through-and-through.
			Missed my liver, I think.
					
					ERIC
			Let's get out of here.

Cautiously backing away from the others, Eric helps Corbett
get up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane.

213  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP

Anne Marie jumps down from the cockpit.  She and Eric lift
Corbett into the plane.

214  EXT.  CARGO PLANE

as it taxis and lifts off.

215  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)

While Eric takes Corbett's handcuffs off, Anne Marie looks
at his wound.  He waves her away.
					
					ERIC
			How come you didn't let him shoot
			me?
					
					CORBETT
			(softly)
			Like I said, I'd still be up on
			that mountain, frozen solid, it
			wasn't for you.
					
					ERIC
			We'll get you to a hospital, soon
			as we get to Fairbanks.
								
								(CONTINUED)
215  CONTINUED:
					
					CORBETT
			So they can patch me up and put
			me in a cage?  Forget it.
			Meyerling's right -- I'm a
			dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like
			him, it's their turn with this
			land.  Put me in the woods, let
			me live or die on my own.

He painfully pulls himself into a sitting position.
					
					CORBETT
			(continuing; peers out
				window)
			Look down there, tell me what any
			of this matters.  Struggles of
			men get swallowed by the bigness.
			Soon there won't be a trace of
			our troubles... or us.
					
					ERIC
			You're wrong.  Everything we do
			leaves its mark.  You said it
			yourself -- there are hundred-
			year-old footprints in the
			tundra.

Too tired to argue, Corbett leans back against the window.
He takes Mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at
it.

EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE SCRIMSHAW

The exquisitely beautiful and detailed engraving depicts a
grizzly beside a wilderness creek, with trees and mountains
in the background.

CORBETT

clutches the scrimshaw in his hand and closes his eyes.

NEW ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)

Eric sighs as he looks at the blood -- Mitchell's blood --
on the back of his hand.  He stares at Corbett for a long
moment.  Then, resolved, he climbs up front and says
something to the Pilot.  Grumbling, the Pilot adjusts his
controls.
									
									CUT TO:



216  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - PUMPING STATION - DAY

The snow clouds are dissipating.  The cargo plane comes down
through them and lands on the airstrip behind the pumping
station.

217  INT.  CARGO PLANE

As it rolls to a stop, Eric throws open the cargo door.
Corbett sits up, surprised.  He and Eric exchange a long
look, then Corbett crosses to the open door and gingerly
steps down onto the snow-covered runway.

218  EXT.  CARGO PLANE

Eric and Anne Marie watch from the door of the plane as
Corbett limps across the runway toward the treeline.  As he
goes, his footprints are dusted over by the snow and wind.

Corbett stops, turns and looks back at Eric, then continues
onward, disappearing into the forest.

ANGLE ON CARGO PLANE

Eric closes the cargo door as the Pilot turns the plane
around and taxis back down the runway.

219  INT.  CARGO PLANE - (AERIAL SHOT)

Eric wearily sits next to Anne Marie.  She kisses him.

The Pilot glances over his shoulder and frowns.
					
					PILOT
			(to himself)
			Too damn crazy in this state
			anymore.  I'm moving back to L.A.

220  INT.  CARGO PLANE - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)

The plane climbs above the fog and snow clouds into a sunny,
ice blue sky.  It banks and turns south.  Behind it, the
mountains roll on toward the Arctic wasteland, forever.

J.P.L. Technician 1  grabs four PHOTOS from the printer. 
Technician 2 swipes stuff off the console,  making room. Together 
they arrange the four photos. They star silently at the  awesome 
COMPOSITE PHOTO.

J.P.L. Technician 1 Motherfu......

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - ENCLOSED ROOM - NIGHT

Golden and all his TECHNICIANS crowd around a console, staring at 
a smaller  version of the COMPOSITE PHOTO.

Golden Copies to the Pentagon, Colorado Space Command, and the 
Washington  office. We gotta compute size, composition, speed, 
impact point

WE SEE the photo -- A HUGE ASTEROID

EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

CAMERA PUSHES THROUGH A CLOUD OF ROCKY, ICY DEBEIS, penetrating 
the cloud until  the HUGE ASTEROID CORE comes into clear view -- 
a mass of dirt and ice -- rough,  craggy, menacing. INT. N.A.S.A. 
- BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

Golden and Clark enter. A group of ten N.A.S.A. SENIOR 
TECHNICIANS are all  talking at once.

Golden Okay guys, one of the worst days in N.A..S.A history just 
got worse.  Ten million to one. A rogue comet came from deep 
space and collided with an  asteroid. Some  kids actually got a 
picture of the collision event and told no one.  The stuff that 
hit this morning was the collision's forward-thrown matter, mere  
pebbles from what's  about to come. Walter? 

Clark A big asteroid. E.T.A., eighteen days. A lot bigger than 
the five mile  one that obliterated the dinosaurs.

Silence. Everybody stares at each other.

The phone CHIRPS.

Golden's Secretary Director, the Pentagon.

Golden hits a button.

A LARGE T.V. SCREEN establishes AUDIO/VISUAL link.

INTERCUT; PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM/ N.A.S.A. - BRIEFING ROOM

INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

Temple sits with the Joint Chiefs, White House Chief of Staff, 
the Directors of  the N.A.S.A., C.I.A., etc.

Temple Dan, we're all here. Tell us what we're up against. 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 In it's simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one  
mile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force 
of all the  nuclear weapons in the  world, times a thousand. Half 
our population will die within 24  hours from tidal waves and 
heat pulses. The other half won't be so lucky. In the  end, it 
will be men  eating the flesh of other men. 
(beat)
 It's not the end of the  world, General, the world - Earth - 
will still be here. But there will be no  life - maybe 
cockroaches and  some resilient strands of bacteria. 

Temple Well, that's really positive, Dan. The President just got 
off the phone  with the Russians. They're just about to launch a 
new Mars Probe on the biggest  rocket in the world.  Golden and 
the N.A.S.A. BRASS exchange sceptical looks.

Golden 
(V.O)
 With the worst guidance system in the world. Their Mars Probe in  
'96 was found by a pygmy tribe in Africa. 

Temple They're going to pull off the probe and replace it with 
four Atlas  Class IV nuclear warheads. Enough punch in their 
opinion - not to break it up -  but to slow it down enough to 
miss Earth's orbit. 

Golden 
(V.O)
 Their launch date is set for next month.

Temple They're going to move it up.

Golden 
(V.O)
 To when?

Temple Sixteen hours from now.

All the N.A.S.A. Technicians CLAMOR at once.

Golden 
(V.O)
 What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together?  
Even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear 
detonation is not  going to work.  The only way is to split the 
thing in half and hope the two pieces  slide past us. 

Temple Thank you for bringing up the impossible, Dan.

Colinswood People, the President's joining us, Mr. President?

President 
(V.O)
 Well, this has been a tough day. The media's all over this.  
They're going to get nothing. Telling the public we might all be 
dead in  eighteen days achieves nothing but panic. 

Golden 
(V.O)
 Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing  
to do unless you have the exact co-ordinates. There are only 
twelve telescopes  powerful enough  to see it right now. You've 
got a full moon goin' for four days -  makes it all but 
impossible to see.. Once these things draw closer to Earth,  
you'll never keep a lid on  this. No way. 

INT. N.A.S.A. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

The video screen blinks off. Golden looks at his Techs.

Golden How many of you are as scared as I am?

Golden raises his hand. All the other N.A.S.A. Techs, one by one, 
raise their  hands.

Golden One giant leap for Mankind. Everyone remember that? This 
is what we are  going to do. We're going to fly to that asteroid 
with a nuclear device, implant  it and get off  before it blows. 
Quincy? 

All eyes turn to N.A.S.A. Chief of R&D, RONALD QUINCY. Quincy has 
coke bottle  glasses and a 198 I.Q.

Quincy Look: set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a 
third degree  burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious 
damage. If we can get a nuke deep  in one of the asteroid's fault 
lines, she'll split in two, like a diamond. 

Golden You're all looking art us like we're crazy. We're not.

Skip Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow.

Golden What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national 
security and could  land me in jail, but in eighteen days there 
arnt' gonna be any jails,  so....We're not gonna use a  current 
shuttle. Gentlemen, I'm talking about the X-71. 

Skip It's done?

Quincy Has been for three months.

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - FLIGHT TESTING FACILITY - DAY

N.A.S.A.'s flight testing facility. A flat, hard, dry area 
dominated by an  ENORMOUS HANGER. The HANGER DOOR is open; breeze 
blows back a BLACK SILK  TARPAULIN, revealing the X-71's NOSE. 
Technicians come and go. 

INT. N.A.S.A - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Golden Time is our enemy. This is like the race to the Moon, guys 
- what this  Agency was founded on.

Skip Boss, we're good at space travel, but you're talkin' about 
drilling a  hole.

Golden Quincy's been working on excavating the ice from the Moon 
- he's gonna  reorient his thinking. Right, Quince?

Quincy Right. And the first thing I'm gonna do is talk to the guy 
I ripped  off. His name is Harry S. Stamper. He's the best oil 
driller in the world. 

Golden I don't care who he is, what he's doing.

EXT. NORWAY COAST - NORTH SEA - "TROLL" OIL RIG - DAY

SUPER -  DAY TWO

Close on a GOLF BALL. THWACK! The golf ball EXPLODES off the tee 
from an oil  rig. The "TROLL" is the largest man-made structure 
in the world - 12 aircraft  carriers big and 1200 feet tall. A 
self-contained city. 

HARRY STAMPER, world's foremost expert on offshore deep drilling, 
immaculately  attired in golf attire and spikes, stands on a 
patch of Astroturf with a five  iron in his hand. Piped-in MOZART 
drown out the rig noise. 

EXT. "TROLL" - DRILLING PLATFORM - "A" DERRICK - DAY 

The main drilling platform. On "A" derrick, Chief Driller, A.J. 
FROST, 30,  handsome, is at the controls. Roughnecks "JIMBO" 
CARTWRIGHT, "BEAR" BROWN,  "CHICK" CHAPPLE, TITO GUEVARA, and MAX 
LOGAN, handle 20 foot sections of PIPE  DRILLING SRTRING with a 
HYDRAULIC TONG AND CLAMP. 

Roughneck BENNIE MORGAN, late 20's an ox of a man, comes across 
the platform,  pulling an oily green coveralls and donning his 
hard-hat. Bennie examines the  rig's DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGE. 

Bennie Chick! take a look at this!

Chick Pressure's been up all morning. She kicked twice on me.

A.J.'s eyes move to a TALL BLOND MAN on his lunch break across 
the rig.

A.J. What did our always-at-lunch-Swedish geologist say?

Bennie Jah, jah, jah. No bleeper. Too much pressure.

Chick You askin' the old man?

A.J. nods and walks off.

EXT. "TROLL" RIG - TOP TIER

Harry HITS another ball. WE REVEAL his target, a GREENPEACE BOAT 
anchored off  the rig. The BALL strikes the side of the boat, 
just missing the head of ONE of  the PROTESTERS.

Harry Almost caught that little bastard.

He admires his shot as his daughter, GRACE, walks up. Grace is 
late 20's,  business dress, Harvard Law.

Grace Having fun?

Harry HITS another ball. It misses the boat, skips across the 
water.

Grace Sure sliced the shit outta that one. 
(frowns)


Harry Watch your language, Gracie.

Grace Seagulls swallow those and they die.

Harry Stupid birds.

Harry's EYES move to a GROUP OF GREENPEACE PROTESTERS across the 
rig, being held  back by Stamper Oil SECURITY GUARDS. 

Grace I just talked with A.J.

Harry Talking to him quite a bit these days....

Grace 
(awkward pause)
 "A" rig's acting up. The drill string kicked twice this  
morning, gave Chick a nasty bruise in the head.

Harry Good. He's not vulnerable there.

Grace Chase Manhatten okayed the bridge financing for the 
Micronesia Project,  but at 21 percent interest. And Lloyd's of 
London refuses to underwrite the  Venezuela> Project....  

Harry Thieves and cowards, all of 'em. Twist their arms.

Grace I am.

Harry Keep twisting. Like a pit bull.

Grace Oh, and that magazine article - they want some human 
interest stuff -  likes and dislikes. "Likes" I said Golf, Fly 
Fishing, Single Malt Scotch, Old  Movies. What about  "Dislikes?"

Harry Any kind of flying and oil company executives. Go deal with 
'em. I  always look better when you're doing the talking.

Harry HITS another ball. CLANG.

Grace You know you donate 300 grand a year to Greenpeace.

Harry smiles at the contradiction.

Harry What'd your mother call me?

Grace Complicated.

Harry Yeah well....I'm complicated.

Grace walks off, passing A.J., winking at him. A.J. winks back.

A.J. What's his mood?

Grace Complicated.

A.J. walks up to Harry.

Harry I understand we're having problems with "A" rig.

A.J. I'm on top of it 
(Harry picks up his bag)
 Harry, you have a second?

Harry Yeah. One.

A.J. I'll hurry. I've worked for you for a long time.

Harry Twelve years.

A.J. And you've been real good to me....

Harry Another company make you an offer, kid?

A.J. No. The reason I am here, today, standing here, talking to 
you. I'm  obviously talking to you...but it's, you know, not, 
uhh...it's not an  oil-related matter exactly....

Harry You're sweating, A.J.

A.J. You know there comes a time in a man's life when...
(to himself)
 No,  that's a cliché...
(to Harry)
 Can I start again? I, uhh, fell...I've fallen...

Harry You hurt yourself?

A.J. In love, I mean. Fallen in love. It's the damnedest thing, 
but this  person you...know...really well.

ACROSS THE PLATFORM - Grace escorts five angry OIL INDUSTRY 
EXECUTIVES over to  Harry. A KLAXON SOUNDS. Harry, alarmed, 
rushes right past them, toward the "A"  Derrick. They follow, 
snapping at his heels

Oil Executive 1 You explicitly promised results at 25 thousand 
feet.

Harry We have results.

Oil Executive 2 But we don't have oil. We've given you everything 
you've  asked....

Harry Horseshit. What the...? Chick! Bennie! Somebody better tell 
me why the  hell "A" derrick is not turning!

Chick hurries up to Harry.

Chick The uhh....the Greenpeace guys.

Harry approaches "A" Derrick. Five MEMBERS of Greenpeace have 
handcuffed  themselves in a circle around the drilling pipe.

Harry Hey there, what can I do for you?

Greenpeace Leader This is an official protest.

Harry 'Course it is. I love you guys. You like dolphins and 
whales, I like 'em  too. Hey, I know you. You too. Didn't you 
have shorter hair?

Greenpeace Leader Stamper, do you know what this thing does to 
the eco-system?

Harry How'd you get out here? Canoe? Rowboat? Oh, that boat down 
there with a  thousand horsepower diesel!

Greenpeace Leader How can you wake up every day and look at 
yourself in the  mirror?

Harry The same way you did when you blow-dried your hair this 
morning. And you  used a curling iron, I betcha. Did you know 
most electricity's from burning oil?  I'' stop drillin' when the 
world - stops usin' it. Bennie, start 'er up! 

Greenpeace Leader Wait........

Harry Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave 
me 57 mil. to  find oil and they ain't leavin' till I do! 'cause 
they have no lives! 

The drill string begins to turn in the hole.

Greenpeace Leader We....we threw away the key.

Harry Sorry. Time is money. BENNIE!

The MASSIVE HYDRAULIC KELLY begins to descend on the Greenpeace 
Activists'  heads.

Greenpeace Leader STOP!!!!

Harry Bennie! Third gear!

The Greenpeace Leader miraculously produces a key and frantically 
begins  unlocking the handcuffs.

Grace turns to the oil executives.

Grace He's good at public relations.

A.J. approaches Grace; they watch Harry.

Grace So? 
(A.J. stares at her)
 What? 
(no response)
 What? 
(no response)
 A.J.?

Suddenly, across "A" Derrick, a KLAXON SOUNDS.

Chick She's kickin'!

The civilians get the hell away.

Harry and A.J. run toward the rig.

Chick Pressure's north of seven thousand!

A.J. We gotta clear the Derrick!

Harry 
(looks at wellhead)
 Chick, rig up another pipe. 
(Chick and Bennie look  at Harry with uncertainty)
 NOW, NOT TOMORROW. 

CHick and Bennie begin clamping, and tong a PIPE STRAND onto the 
DRILL STRING  like an INDY PIT STOP CREW.

A.J. Harry, we've hit pressure. We gotta bleed it off. e go any 
deeper, we'll  blow the rig.

Harry Thanks for that opinion. Chick, full speed!

A.J. The bit's five thousand feet down! Full speed'll rip the 
pipe apart!

Harry You learn all this in college? I been doing this thirty 
years, kid. Get  on the controls.

A.J. moves reluctantly to the DRILLING CONTROLS. Chick nods to 
A.J., who engages  the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL 
SPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten  feet into the hole, 
then....

The torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string. 
The drill  spins freely.

A.J. hits the "stop! lever and stares at Harry.

The roughnecks converge around the wellhead.

A.J. I'm goin' down. Reattach it. Gimme a wrench and a band 
coupling.

Chick hand the items to A.J.

A.J. descends into the drilling hole.

INT. DOWN THE DRILLING HOLE - DAY

A.J., holding his breath under water, shimmies down the drilling 
pipe  feet-first, inside the water-filled concrete tube running 
from the rig to the  ocean floor. 

A.J. begins wrestling the disconnected sections together. EXT. 
RIG - "A" DERRICK

The wellhead KICKS. The rig platform shakes and shudders. 
SEAWATER erupts from  the wellhead.

Chick The drill hole's flooding!

Grace A.J.!!

Harry strips off his jacket and climbs into the wellhead. He 
takes a huge breath  and disappears into the brine-filled 
drilling hole. 

INT. DRILLING HOLE

A.J. is pinned against the hole wall by one of the disconnected 
pipes. Harry  comes down the hole. He plants his back against the 
hole wall and kicks the  pipe, freeing A.J. A slow, deep, RUMBLE 
emanates from below. The Briny water  inside the hole suddenly 
turns BLACK and VISCOUS. 

A.J. and Harry exchange an alarmed look. Harry, then A.J., pull 
for the surface,  up the drilling hole as -- 

EXT. DRILLING PLATFORM - "A" DERRICK - DAY

-- the wellhead KICKS again. The rig platform SHUDDERS violently. 
The derrick  sways. SEAWATER SPEWS up from the wellhead. 

Chick Get back, she's gonna blow!

Grace, Chick, Bennie and the other Roughnecks huddle around the 
flooded drilling  hole, waiting. Tense, agonising seconds pass. 

Harry scrambles out, covered in....CRUDE OIL.

He grabs Grace and pulls her away.

Grace Where's A.J.!!!?

Harry RIGHT BEHIND ME! RUN!

The platform SHAKES. Harry, Grace, and the others sprint away as 
--

A GEYSER OF CRUDE OIL erupts from the drilling hole, blowing A.J. 
out of the  hole fifteen feet above the wellhead. A.J. crashes to 
the platform floor. 

CRUDE OIL rains down on Grace and the Roughnecks...they run to 
A.J.

Grace Never do that again!

CLOSE ON A.J. - he's looking back at the DRILL HOLE, panting, 
traumatised,  greasy oil raining on his head.

A.J. You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't 
do the  first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...! 
(pulls out case; opens it)
 I  got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk 
to him, but try it on. 

She reaches for the ring. It slips from A.J.'s hand and falls 
through the grated  floor, pinging off the rig's steel pylons, 
100 feet into the sea below. 

Grace Don't worry! Tiffany's insures up to a week from purchase!

A.J. stares despondently over the railing.

Harry, black with crude oil, staggers past A.J.

A.J. 
(pointedly)
 Good plan, Harry.

Harry 
(walks over to Oil Execs)
 There's your oil, gentlemen. Now get the hell  off my rig.

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY

Golden, Clark, Skip, Flip and the rest of the Mission Control 
Technicians watch  a live feed from Russia. A RUSSIAN ENERGIA 
SUPER BOOSTER ROCKET sits on its  launch platform. 

Flip Look it that sucker. They got a nuke up there in sixteen 
hours?

Skip It'll never fly. Never.

Clark Three things the Russians make well, guys - vodka, gymnasts 
and rockets.  Don't count 'em out.

Golden It's the late 20th century, I run the U.S. Space Program, 
and I'm  praying to God the Russians are better at this than we 
are.... 

EXT. RUSSIA SPACE CENTER - SMOLINSKAYA A.F. BASE - DAY

The ground begins to SHAKE uncontrollably. EXHAUST billows out 
from the Rocket's  BOOSTERS. The Russian rocket blasts off and 
lifts into.... 

Something's wrong. The Rocket stops accelerating and stands still 
for a moment.  It falls to Earth; BLOWING UP in a thunderous 
inferno. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY

Golden, Clark, and all the N.A.S.A. Techs stare at the burning

Roughnecks 
(UNISON)
 Hole Number Seventy-Six!

The Oil Executives stand off, watching.

Oil Executive 1 Seventy-Six?

Oil Executive 2 This is Harry's Seventy-Sixth straight hit.

Oil Executive 1 The man's a legend.

We hear the WHOP, WHOP, WHOP of HELICOPTER BLADES. Harry, Grace 
and A.J. turn  toward the noise.

TWO U.S. ARMY BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS whirr across the choppy 
ocean.

EXT. OIL RIG - TOP TIER HELI-PAD - MINUTES LATER

The helicopters land on the heli-pad on the oil rig's top tier, 
MAJOR STINSON,  50's, wearing formal dress and sunglasses along 
with two strapping ADJUTANTS  stride across the rig. 

Major Stinson Harry Stamper? I'm Major William Stinson, United 
States Army. I  need a few words with you. In private.

Harry Say it now, say it quick, or get off my rig, Major. I've 
got a business  to run here.

Major Stinson You've been summoned back to the States.

Harry Who's doin' the summoning?

Major Stinson Your Government, Mr Stamper.

INT. SOMEPLACE IN KENTUCKY - HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

Jimbo, Theo and Pearl sit in a holding cell some place. Jimbo's 
banging on the  door.

Jimbo Hey, zipperheads! Ever watch "L.A. Law?" Right to remain 
silent, right  to an attorney? My brother's a bad-ass lawyer - 
he's gonna sue your asses to  Mars. I was in pre-  law for a 
month - you can't put somebody in jail for makin' a phone  
call!!! 

Pearl It isn't about that, Jimbo. We saw something we weren't 
supposed to.

Theo Something they're not telling the public.

Jimbo Yeah, that's why they were so hot for the co-ordinates. Do 
you think  it's an asteroid? Or comet?

Theo I dunno - but I bet it's a whopper.

INT. N.A.S.A. FLIGHT MISSION ROOM - DAY

Harry, AJ. and Grace are led into the room by Stinson. Quincy's 
eyes move to  Harry --

Quincy He's here.

Quincy, Clark and Golden stand, approach --

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Dan Golden, meet Mister Harry Stamper, the finest oil driller  
in the world.

Golden Mister Stamper..
(shaking hands)
 Dan Golden, I'm Director of --

Harry I know who you are. I watched T.V. once. Apollo 8, right? 
First manned  lunar orbit.

Golden That was a long time ago. I run this place now. And we've 
got a serious  problem on our hands that Quincy here thinks you 
might be able to help us out  with -- 

Quincy eagerly outstretches his hand. They shake. Quincy doesn't 
let go.

Quincy I'm a big fan, Mr. Stamper.

Harry I kinda caught that. 
(to Golden)
 What's the problem, gentlemen?

Golden I wonder if we might speak alone?

Harry These two are my right and left arms. Grace Stamper and 
Albert Jack  Frost. Stupid name, so we call him A.J.. 
(handshakes)
 They run my company. You  talk to me, you  talk to them. 

Golden Okay.

Golden direct everyone into --

INT. N.A.S.A. - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Golden, Temple, Clark, Harry, Grace, and A.J. sit in a dark room 
viewing a  VIDEOTAPE. Quincy stands beside the projector, 
supplying narration. On the tape  we see Harry on a rig platform 
shaking hands with an ARAB BUSINESSMAN -- 

Harry Great, home movies.

Grace and A.J. smile.

Quincy Nineteen eighty five. The first well drilled over 50 
thousand feet.  They said it couldn't be done. You did it. 
Incredible. 

ON THE SCREEN - Harry's on another rig, shaking hands with an 
INDONESIAN  BUSINESSMAN. Harry leans over and kisses the bit. The 
Businessmen shake their  heads, awed. 

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Nineteen Ninety-One. Directional drilling through two miles of  
anthracite. They also said that couldn't be done. You did it. 
Incredible. 

Harry looks at Quincy strangely; this sure is a bizarre form of 
celebrity.

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 Ninteen Ninety-Three. The first hole over seventy thousand.  
Once again they said --

Golden Move it along, Quincy.

Quincy Right, sorry. Mister Stamper, you're the world's foremost 
expert in  deep drilling. You hold specialized patents in high 
speed bits, drilling fluids,  downhole motors Can I call you 
Harry? 

Harry Stick with Stamper.

Golden Well, Mister Stamper, we need you to drill a hole. It's in 
a difficult  place.

Harry I've drilled in them all.

Golden Not...this place. This is really out there. 
(beat)
 Space, Mister  Stamper.

Harry As in...outer?

SATELLITE PHOTOS OF THE ASTEROID come up on the screen --

Temple You've watched the news the last 24 hours? You heard about 
the meteor  shower? 
(Harry nods)
 What you don't know is that an asteroid is on a collision  
course with  Earth. If it hits us, Earth as we know it will be 
over. 

Golden We're manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a 
nuclear device in  it's core. To do that we need to drill an 
eight hundred foot hole. 

Harry looks at A.J. and Grace.

Harry A.J., is this guy shitting me?

A.J. I don't think they shit people at N.A.S.A., Harry --

Harry An eight hundred foot hole. On a moving asteroid. In space.

Golden All we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm, 
any help you  can provide. We'll pay your usual consultancy, of 
course.  

Harry Show me your rig.

INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - DAY

Quincy leads Golden, Harry, A.J., Grace, and Clark through 
N.A.S.A.'s Research  and Development area. This place looks like 
"Q's" weapons shop from the James  Bond movies as funded by every 
company on the fortune 500 -- 

Huge, clinically clean, dominated by MASSIVE ROCKET ENGINES. 
TECHNICIANS in  white coats and hairnets work on a variety of 
equipment. 

TECHNICIANS hunch over a ROVER VEHICE, not the golf cart used on 
the moon. This  is low, squat, sturdy, with an enclosed airlocked 
passenger compartment. 

Quincy The "Armadillo" - our fourth generation rover. It carries 
a six-cell  solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint 
venture with the Germans. 
(winks)
  It's designed by Porsche. 

Quincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM 
on a gurney,  powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is 
connected to an OIL DRILLING  BIT. 

Harry Where's the Kelly?

Quincy This baby works without one.

Harry How does it work?

Harry starts to inspect the bit.

Quincy It works through a series of complexly designed 
differential gears.

Harry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further --

Harry This is my Patent.

Quincy "Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics," 
by Harry S.  Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent 
Office last year. 

Harry You stole it.

Quincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper.

Quincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button. The 
drill bit  presses down into a block of concrete and begins to 
rapidly CHEW through it, as  Harry marvels at the realisation of 
his design.

Quincy 
(cont'd)
 We built this arm to mine ice from the moon -- greatest  
discovery in space in thirty years.

Harry What'd this cost?

Golden Ten million.

Quincy Twenty-our million.

Harry Boy, I'm in the wrong line of work. So, that's where my 
taxes go. For  thievin' incompetent, government employed rip-off 
artists?

A.J. No torque adjustment, no pressure release valve....a big 
hunk of junk.

Quincy We're working on that.

Harry What happens if you hit gas? You have three seconds. Drill 
faster, run  like hell, or pray. 
(beat)
 Time's up. You're dead., The rig just blew. 

Golden Gentlemen, gentlemen, wait a second. The crux of the 
matter....

Harry Hang on. I betcha everyone in this room has a PH.D.

Golden Or three....

Harry I left school after tenth grade. I earned my PH.D every day 
offshore  drilling holes. You can't get it in a book. Drilling 
holes is about instinct -  about smellin' it. Drillin' holes is 
an art. You want the crux of the matter?
(beat)
 You stole my  patent, and you don't have a goddamn idea how to 
use it. As for this piece o'  crap, don't insult me. 
(walks around the rig)
 I'll rebuild it - the right way - and drill the  hole for you. 

Grace Uhm, pop, could we discuss this...?

Harry Just give me a space suit.

Golden You won't need one. You're not going up.

Harry You don't have a choice. I think all you PH.D's know that.

Harry walks off. Grace and A.J. follow.

Golden 
(calling after Harry)
 Harry. Let's figure this out.

INT. N.A.S.A. - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Harry sits opposite Golden and Temple. Grace and A.J. stand 
behind him.

Harry First of all, you're going to buy my patent.

Temple Of course, completely in order. What is the price?

Harry Fifty million dollars.

Uncomfortable pause. Temple clears his throat.

Temple Mr. Stamper, this mission is to preserve the future of....

Harry You're right, too low. I'm still pissed. Seventy million.

Temple Done.

Harry looks to Grace.

Harry Give that money to my Greenpeace buddies. 
(smile)
 Told  you...complicated.

Harry goes to shake, pulls back --

Harry 
(cont'd)
 And I never want to pay taxes again.

Temple I'll call the I.R.S., try to uhm, explain the situation.

They begin to shake. Harry withdraws his hand.

Harry I have this great log cabin in Montana. It's kind of a  
nature...getaway...thing.

Temple You want us to buy that, too?

Harry No. I fly fish there. But the fly fishin's sucked ever 
since they put in  that goddamn hydro-electric dam. I want it 
gone by the time I get back. 

Temple reluctantly nods. They stand to shake, Harry pulls away 
again.

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Now about my crew.

Golden The deal was for you, not others.

Harry I'm only as good as the men I work with. The ones in those 
home movies  of yours.

Golden It's out of the question.

Harry half-smiles to Grace.

Golden 
(cont'd)
 Okay, who?

Harry :My chief tool pusher. You game A.J.? A.J. Wouldn't miss 
it, Harry.

Harry And my roughnecks, Roustabouts, and Rockhound?

Temple Rock what? Is that a dog?

Harry No. Just a meek, geek geophysicist.

Golden What kind of men are these?

INT. SUPERSTRETCH LIMOUSINE - DAY

Bennie, Chick 
(30's, a street philosopher)
, Max 
(35, hulky)
, TITO, and ROCKHOUND  
(small, wiry)
 are riding in high style. Chick is hanging out of the sun roof  
with his shirt off. Radio's on full blast. Rockhound's pouring 
whiskey from the  fancy decanters. 

Chick We're living LARGE!

Bennie 
(talking on a cellular phone)
 Give me nickels on Miami, Washington, San  Diego, and Green Bay. 
(listens)
 Quit whining. Last thing I need is to be friends  with my 
bookie. 
(listens, then angry)
 
(MORE)
 

Bennie 
(cont'd)
 Look, when the entire Mexican Army had Butch and the Sundance  
Kid trapped in that Hacienda, did they wait to die? Hell no. They 
went out guns  blazing. I live  by the code of that movie, man. 

Bennie hangs up the phone, he looks across from him at -- Tito 
Guevara, late  30's, stocky, tattooed, Latino, 
(reformed 118th Street L.A. o.g. gangbanger who  was rescued from 
the streets ten years back and put to work on a rig by Harry)
  is reading a book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus." 

Chick drops down into his seat, continues his heated discussion 
with Max.

Chick Charlie Bronson could kick Steve McQueen's ass and have 
enough left over  to duke it out with Burt Reynolds in his 
"Smokey and the Bandit" period. 

Max I'm glad you qualified that shit 'cause you know the Burt 
Reynolds of  "Deliverence" would have kicked Charlie's ass.  

Chick Burt was trouble in that flick.

Max What would you say the all-time, slam-bam, take-no-prisoners, 
kick-ass  Charlie Bronson movie is?

Chick All time? Well, let me think. "Dirty Dozen," the first 
"Death Wish." No,  no! That movie where he hunted the buffalo. I 
don't remember the name but he  hunted a buffalo and he said like 
three words during the whole picture. That's my  selection. 

Max Fine. The buffalo movie. That's your pick. You relly think 
that buffalo  Charlie could have thrown-down with the Steve 
McQueen form "Bullitt?" 

Chick He'da whooped his ass and then his father's. We'll settle 
this right  now. Rockhound? You heard the debate. You're the 
Supreme Court. What's the final  verdict? 

Rockhound Tough call. But for me though, one name -- Poncherello. 
Eric  Estrada. You know, "Chips."

Chick and Max just look at him. A beat. Then --

Max What did you ask him for? Guy makes his living looking at 
rocks.

The limo pulls over and stops. The DRIVER gets out and walks to 
the rear door.  Opens it.

EXT. N.A.S.A. - FRONT OF FACILITY - DAY

The Roughnecks get out in front of the JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. They 
stare up at  the familiar N.A.S.A. LOGO imprinted on the 
building. Chick and Bennie exchange  looks -- 

BEHIND THEM

A battered Ford pick-up pulls up, driven by 71 year-old "MAMA" 
MABEL BROWN.  Mabel's six foot-five, 375 pound son, BEAR, gets 
out of the car. 

Bear 'Bye, Mama.

Mabel Reginald, get over here and kiss your Mama goodbye.

Bear In front of the guys?

Mabel Never too old to kiss your Mama.

JIMBO, six-foot five, 375 pounds, bald, pulls up on a HARLEY 
DAVIDSON  motorcycle. He climbs off the bike.

Chick There ain't no oil in this place. What the hell are we 
doing here?

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MEDICAL WING - DAY

Harry has just briefed his crew on the mission.

Bear ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

Chick Harry, this is some "Star Wars" shit. This ain't for us.

Harry It's a job, like any other. Just a different location.

Max We work rigs. We understand rigs. We don't know dick about 
being  astronauts.

Rockhound 
(pointing)
 I might add that to get us up there they're going to have  to 
strap our asses on one of those rockets. That means fire, 
involuntary shit  release, and a slew of other stuff I can't hang 
with. 

JIMBO We don't have "The Right Stuff," know what I'm saying? 
(looking around)
  We're Roughnecks. 

Harry I'd rather die up there fighting this thing than sit  here 
waiting for it. 

Harry's line hangs in the air. Everyone exchanges looks.

Bear I don't like the idea of waiting around to croak. It's 
wimpy.

Chick If Harry-the-iron-ass is going, I'm going with him.

Bear Hell, I'm going just so I can say I went. 
(shrugs)
 Once we get up there,  it's making hole.

Tito I'm in.

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Max, Chick, and Tito sit in HOSPITAL SMOCKS on two examination 
tables. They have  tattoos, long hair. A cigarette dangles from 
Tito's lips. AIR FORCE NURSES are  everywhere. A NURSE clips a 
SWATCH OF HAIR from each of the men. She comes to  Tito. He grabs 
her arm. Takes the scissors from her. 

Tito Nobody touches my hair but me.

He cuts a SWATCH of hair, gives it to her. A SECOND NURSE is in 
front of Max and  Tito.

Max You're not taking any more blood. You vampires already have 
enough to feed  your coven for a year.

Nurse 
(nasally-voiced)
 We need to know what substances you've recently  ingested.

Tito What, uhh, "substances" you talkin' about?

Nurse 
(matter of fact)
 Drugs.

Ma and Tito eye each other nervously. Head Nurse, HELGA, stands 
before Chick  with an ENAMA PROBE and a JAR OF VASELINE. 

Chick An Ena-WHAT?

Helga Enema.

Chick And you want to stick it where?

Helga sticks the ENEMA PROBE in a jar of VASELINE.

Chick 
(cont'd)
 No way, lady. I came here to drill.

Helga So did I.

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING CENTER - DAY

Chick sits before a hugely endowed but square female N.A.S.A. 
CLINICAL  PSYCHOLOGIST.

Psychologist Say the first two words that come to mind, beginning 
with each  letter.

Chick Bodacious and....Bountiful. 
(she holds up "S")
 Succulent and Sinful.

She holds up the letter "F" and HOLD ON CHICK'S REACTION.

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Harry sits before the Chief Physician, DR. BANKS. Golden looks 
out the window.  Dr. Banks, dead-serious, flips through the 
medical and psychiatric test scores. 

Dr Banks Mr. Stamper, your men...are...take Mr. Chappel. I 
believe they call  him Chic.

Harry Charles, but if you call him that, he'll kill you.

Dr Banks 
(nervous laugh)
 I assume you're joking. 
(no response)
 Your men show  aggression, extreme maladjustment to their 
surroundings, anti-social behaviour  -- 

Harry With all due respect, Doctor, I don't know too army guys 
who are social  when someone is trying to jam a tube up their 
butt. 

Dr Banks Does your company have a drug testing program? These 
toxicology  reports are a throwback to the sixties. All show huge 
levels of nicotine and  alcohol. Three of the, four show illegal 
drugs. A couple I had to look up. One of them  had "Kematine" -- 
a very potent sedative. 

Harry A lot of people take sedatives.

Dr Banks This one is used on horses.

Harry I don't tell my men how to live their lives. They're with 
me to do a job  and they do it well.

Golden This is getting us nowhere. Can they fly, or not?

Dr Banks 
(flipping through physical records)
 Failed. Failed. Really failed.  Under the circumstances...
(locks eyes with Golden)
 They're the finest physical  specimens I've ever seen. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - LONGSHOT

Harry's crew walk together in newly issued N.A.S.A. jumpsuits. 
Bear and JIMBO  have ripped the sleeves and collars off their X-
Large suits. 

They walk past two N.A.S.A. mathematicians.

Mathematician 1 
(to mathematician 2)
 We're screwd.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Temple and Golden standing there with their arms crossed, 
watching the motley  crew of Roughnecks. They're joined by 
U.S.A.F. test pilots COLONEL SHARP, a  young Chuck Yeager type, 
and LT. COLONEL LUCAS TRUMAN, 30's, rigid and muscular. 



Sharp I mean, they kind of look like Armstarong, Lovell, and 
Glenn. 
(turns,  soberly to Golden)
 So, my wife and little girls' lives are in their hands, sir? 

Golden We need to drill. Do you know how to drill, colonel? 
(beat)
 Neither do  I. They're going up.

Temple 
(pointing to his lapel)
 With my stars came the power to be blunt. These  drillers are 
not trained for this, Dan.

Truman shakes his head. Sharp eyes Golden, waiting for a 
response.

Golden General, it's our job to get them ready to go into space. 
They're there  to do the drilling. 
(beat, then)
 And Colonel Sharp, we all have families. 

A hard look from Sharp to Temple, as Golden walks away.

Temple 
(to Golden)
 If they can't drill this hole, my men are going to take  over.

INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DAY

Quincy is face-to-face with Golden. TECHS work on the drilling 
arm in the b.g.  Harry and the Roughtnecks are across the room. 

Harry That Armadillo car. Get it in here.

In rolls the Armadillo, two TECHNICIANS pushing it. Harry and the 
guys look at  it. Quincy shows it off.

Quincy Pressurised titanium alloy cab. Airlocked life support. 
The chassis's  by General Motors. Heavy duty suspension and six 
wheel drive. 

Harry How were you going to power your drill arm?

Quincy Turbo-jet engine fuelled by Kerosene and liquid oxygen.

Harry I need to be able to start and stop. I need different 
speeds, and I need  reverse.

Quincy A jet engine can't do that.

Harry It can if it's hooked up to a clutch. A.J., get me a Mack 
truck  transmission.

Quincy That's so simple it's brilliant.

Harry I'm a simple man. But don't underestimate me.

A.J. Chick, Max! Mack truck tranny!

Chick and Max hurry off. A.J. smiles at Harry.

INT. JOHNSON CTR - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - WORKROOM - DAY

Harry, A.J., Bennie, Chick, Max, and Tito sit before Quincy, who 
demonstrates a  series of components on the N.A.S.A. SPACE SUIT. 

Quincy The new generation EMU - Extravehicular Mobility Unit - 
provides oxygen  for seven hours, a pressurised enclosure, and 
temperate control. The gloves and  helmet slide  on and lock with 
a twist, like this. The cap is worn underneath. It  contains a 
mike and headphones for two-way communication. We'll be able to 
see  you from a small  video cam mounted inside the helmet. The 
Undergarment has 300 feet  of plastic tubing circulating cooling 
water. Owen... 

OWEN THE TAILOR, five foot nothing & bald, stands in front of the 
men.

Owen These are made for men 5'8" to 6'2", between 140 and 200 
pounds. All of  you fit within those parameters - thank God we 
won't have to do any  re-tailoring.... 

Owen stops because --

Bear and Jimbo stand in the doorway --

JIMBO Yo. This where we get our suits?

Bear Sorry, we're late. Doc said we had... What do we got?

JIMBO Cholesterol difficulties. Said we gotta enter "The Zone."

Bear Shit, the only zone I know is the one around my mama's 
grill.

JIMBO 
(holding up form)
 But we're approved.

Owen looks at the human mountains standing before hi, and then at 
the tiny EMU  suit. Alterations will be necessary. 

INT. JOHNSON CENTER - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - MORNING

Clark briefs Harry and the mildly attentive Roughnecks. Sharp, 
Truman, CO-PILOTS  MEGAN WATTS 
(30's, tough as nails)
 and STAN WESTON stand in the back along with  N.A.S.A. Engineers 
JACK CROSS and RAYMOND SEARS. 

Clark United States astronauts train for eighteen months. You 
have nine days.  Officers Sharp, Truman, Watts and Weston are 
your military instructors and the  only pilots to have flown the 
spacecraft. 
(beat)
 Each is a combat decorated officer  and among the finest men and 
women we have in the service. Pay attention to  them. 

Sharp We spend six months on emergency training - we're throwing 
that out. If  we fail, everyone dies. Game over. That's a heavy 
load but it's ours to carry.  The purpose of this is to train you 
in the physical and mental rigors of working  in a weightless 
enviroment so that you will not panic. So you can do your jobs.  
(beat)
 You will vomit.  Your eyes will be sucked into the back of your 
heads. You'll be so  tired you can't eat but that won't matter 
'cause you'll be so sore you can't  take a dump. By the  
way...good morning. 

INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - DAY

Splash, Splash. Harry and the Roughnecks descend underwater. They 
look like  Michelin Men in their thick space suits. Navy divers 
are around them as they are  lined up. 

Through the underwater speaker, WE HEAR a trainer giving them 
instructions for  their weightless aerobic training. WE HEAR a 
loud, embarrassing gastric sound  from Bear's suit. 

Bear Houton, we have a problem. That is some vicious methane.

Harry gives a "shut the fuck up" look. Time passes as the guys 
are dying,  HUFFING and PUFFING. One by one, they reach 
exhaustion. A cabled harness hoists  each out.

INT. JOHNSON CENTER - CARDIO LAB - DAY

Harry and his team, in T-shirts and running shorts, jog on a 
series of  threadmills, wired to EKG machines, nostrils taped 
shut, breathing tubes locked  in their mouths. EXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 
JET HANGER - DAY

A gleaming spit-shine hanger full of fifteen N.A.S.A. T-38 
fighter jets. Our  drill team walks up looking worn out. They are 
met at the open hanger door by  pilots CHUCK JR., Vietnam vet, 
leatherneck-take-no-pussy-bullshit-type-of-guy  and HAMMER. 

Chuck Jr. On this mission, they tell me you will experience the 
worst G-Forces  in the history of flight. It's like an elephant 
sitting on your chest. So, I  intend to flip you, spin you, splat 
your bodies till your bones hurt. Now load up and  enjoy the 
flight. 

The Roughnecks, wearing flight suits and helmets, board the 
planes. Harry does  not like the look of these things. Bear is 
trying to figure out how to fit  inside. 

Bear Thing's made for a child - like my kid's car seat.

Chuck Jr. and Hammer walk up to a nervous Harry.

Chuck Jr. What's the problem, Texas tough guy?

Harry I've got a thing about flying.

Chuck Jr. Not good for an astronaut. 
(looks to Hammer)
 Hammer, go easy, don't  rip his guts out.

Hammer Sure thing, Chuck.

INT. JET FIGHTER.

Harry plastered to the seat, MOANING so scared he can't puke. The 
plane  barrel-rolls and dives straight to the ground. Harry is 
GRUNTING and sweating  trying to stay conscious. 

EXT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY

The T-38's are pulling up and letting the drill crew out. They 
walk back with  white sweat, soaked faces and wobbly legs. Harry 
exits the plane. 

Harry I hate to fly. I hate to fly. I hate it so much.

Harry leans over to puke.

INT. N.A.S.A. T-38 JET HANGER - DAY

The Roughnecks walking to the T-38 Hanger. Sharp stands on the 
stairway to the  707 and calls everyone to attention.

Sharp Trainees, AT EASE 
(in command)
 We are not done here. We're taking you  for a little ride. This 
bird will climb to 40 thousand feet and drop to 10  thousand feet 
to give  you the feeling of weightlessness for 30 seconds. 
Welcome to  N.A.S.A.'s Vomit Comet. INT. VOMIT COMET

The plane drops. The Roughnecks lift off inside. Everyone's 
flying around the  cabin. It's a disaster. Guys bump heads. Bear 
floats like a beached whale. Jimbo  rams the roof. Hary hold a 
barf bag as he floats. An alarm SOUNDS, then the  plane levels 
off, the guys go slamming into the floor. 

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER BATHROOM

Tracking past a row of stalls, WE SEE the soles of a pair of 
shoes peeking out.  Then another pair, another, and another over 
the multiple sounds of guts being  tossed into the toilet. 

Golden, Clark, and Sharp stand outside the stalls.

Golden This is like putting the Hell's Angels in space.

INT. N.A.S.A. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT

Harry and the Roughnecks are welding the Armadillo, working tough 
and hard.

INT. N.A.S.A. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

The Roughnecks are getting dressed.

Max 
(to Chick)
 We're going to go pound some brews where they have a lot of  
sweaty, naked women. You in?

Chick 
(shakes head)
 No. I got to take care of something.

The Roughnecks walk out, leaving Chick behind.

INT N.A.S.A. CAR - NIGHT

Driven by a uniformed N.A.S.A. TECH, Chick pulls up to a house in 
a residential  neighbourhood. He sits there with a beat, unsure 
of what to do. 

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Chick walks up to the house, KNOCKS. DENISE WILLIAMS answers the 
door.

Chick Hey, Denise.

Denise What do you want, Chick?

A big six-year old boy, TOMMY, runs up behind his mom.

Tommy Who is it, Mommy?

Chick looks at Tommy, smiles.

Denise It's um...just a salesman, honey.

Chick Hi.

Tommy 
(looking straight up)
 You look like big foot.

Chick kneels, extends his hand. Tommy smiles and shakes it. Chick 
doesn't want  to let go.

Chick I got a feeling you're going to be pretty big yourself. 
Denise Go  inside and play, Tommy.

Tommy Okay, mommy. 'Bye, Big Foot.

Chick 'Bye, Tommy.

Chick watches Tommy run off. He looks to Denise.

Denise What was I supposed to tell him? We've got a life here 
now, Chick, with  someone we can depend on.

Chick What I did before was wrong. Every day of my life I regret 
it. I can see  you've got a good thing going, Denise, I'm not 
trying to mess that up. But this  thing's come my  way and I got 
the chance to do something really right. 

Denise This another one of your scams, Chick?

Chick It's no scam. You might just be proud of me.

Denise opens the door a little wider, SHE SEES the car in the 
driveway. The  N.A.S.A. logo stencilled on the door. The N.A.S.A. 
Tech waiting. 

Denise What's going on, Chick?

Chick I can't tell you now. But if it comes out good, I'll be 
back. 
(beat)
  Then maybe you'd consider telling Tommy I'm not a...salesman. 
It's good to see  you. You look really  beautiful. 

Chick turns and walks away.

Denise Hey, Chick. 
(Chick turns)
 You be careful.

INT. LUCKY LAURIE'S - NIGHT

A seedy Houston drinking hole. All the Roughnecks sit at the bar. 
The bar is  littered with EMPTY MUGS AND SHOTGLASSES. A WOMAN 
looks at Bennie. 

Woman What are you boys doin' down here in good 'ol Houston?

Bennie 
(burps)
 We're in astronaut training.

This gets the reaction you'd expect.

INT. JOHNSON CENTER - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - LATE NIGHT

Harry and Quincy go over a list of stuff to order and logistical 
problems.  N.A.S.A. Tech rushes into the room.

N.A.S.A. Tech Space Command spotted more incoming.

Quincy 
(springing up)
 Where' it headed? How big?

N.A.S.A. Tech Don't know.

They start to run out of the room. Harry follows.

INT. ROCKET ENGINE DEVELOPMENT ROOM

The camera follows up a long ladder to a huge rocket bell housing 
where A.J. and  Grace are kissing passionately. They notice Harry 
and Quincy, and the other  Techs heading for Mission Control. 
Harry locks eyes with A.J. He doesn't like  it. A.J. and Grace 
know something is up. They follow Harry and the others into  
Mission Control. 

INT. MISSION CONTROL - LATE NIGHT

The room is lit up. Men are scrambling. Phones and satellite 
charts pop up.  Tracking devices PING. Golden on top of the 
chaos. A TRACKING TECH plots on a  map. Clark stands over a 
N.A.S.A. TECH reading a computer screen. 

Golden Projected impact tracking. I need stats!

Tracking Tech Eastern Asian Hemisphere... someplace...ETA 17 
minutes.

N.A.S.A. Tech We have confirmation. The incoming is about the 
size of the  Astrodome.

Clark We've got to warn.

Golden Warn who? The whole South Pacific?

Golden, with lack of sleep and stress, falls back into a chair. 
He closes his  eyes, opens them -- finding Harry in the upper 
Mission Control Deck. They lock  eyes for a long moment. 

INT. SHANGHAI - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

The city ablaze in neon. The harbour, floating junksmanned by 
Chinese merchants.  A loud sonic boom CRACKS in the sky. There's 
a BRIGHT FLASH in the sky. Night  becomes day for two seconds. 

The world slows down, motion creeps. The bright FLASH catches the 
face of a  little BOY reaching out for his father's hand. The 
asteroid SHRIEKS down,  hitting the harbour's surface in a red 
hot FLASH-BOILED at 100 thousand degrees. 

INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT

The room is silent. Reports are starting to come in about the 
devastation.  Golden walks up to Harry who is standing with Grace 
and A.J. He pulls Harry  aside. 

Golden Stamper, answer me one question - have you ever let anyone 
down?

We go close on Harry's face. Searing flashbulbs popping, WIDEN TO

INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROO - NIGHT

WE SEE him from behind as he addresses the massive crowd. The 
U.S. PRESIDENT  stands before a throng of reporters.

PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS

Papers headlines, CNN reporters flash on screens. Images of 
people watching the  news in bars, at home. A NEW YORK POST slams 
down on the pavement, the headline -  SHANGHAI DISASTER, MASSIVE 
DEATH TOLL RISING.

INT. SOMEPLACE IN KENTUCKY - HOLDING CELL - DAWN

Jimbo is talking to an F.B.I. AGENT who is on the other side of 
the bars holding  a newspaper.

Jimbo If it's over then why aren't you lettin' us out of this 
goddamn cell?

F.B.I. Agent Be real soon, son.

The agent flips the newspaper into the holding cell and walks 
away.

Jimbo Don't walk away, I want to talk to my lawyer. You hear me?

Pearl 
(refering to the newspaper)
 This says that the asteroid came from the  Southern Hemisphere.

Theo Southern Hemisphere?

Pearl No kidding. It's a big sky - they want people to look the 
other way.

INT. MANHATTEN - TAXI CAB

Stu the cabbie is riding with a WALL STREET GUY.

Stu Kennedy lied about the Bay of Pigs, Nixon...Watergate, say no 
more.  Clinton. One word. 'Women.' If I know one thing; ALL 
PRESIDENTS LIE. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - TRAINING ROOM - MORNING

Morning after the devastating disaster in Shanghai. Harry walks 
into the quiet  room. Harry's all business. 

Harry Forty thousand people died last night. But I guess that 
didn't concern  any of you. I hope you all had a good time last 
night. 

The Roughnecks look around. They know there were wrong.

Chick I gotta tell you...I'm scared.

Harry Well, you should be scared. We all should be. 'Cause if we 
fail, they  say the Earth will die.

Harry sits down, looks out the window at N.A.S.A. Techs working 
in the room down  below.

Harry You think these N.A.S.A. guys are a bunch of clean-cut 
pussies, that's  it. They can out think you, they can outrun you. 
This job, gentlemen, is as real  as it gets. I need every one of 
you. 
(he looks them in the eye)
 If you're not up to it,  then walkout of that door. 

Finally. Theo and Pearl, frustrated, go to the TWO-WAY MIRROR, 
blocking Jimbo  from view.

Theo I'm hungry! When're we gonna eat?

Pearl I have p.m.s.!! I need some ibuprofen!

Jimbo grabs Randy's legal pad and writes:

HELP!! BIG ASTEROID GOING TO HIT EARTH. COORDINATES 712 BY 345.

Randy stares at the message.

Randy Okay, I'm done here!

The door opens. Two F.B.I. AGENTS lead Randy out. Jimbo looks at 
Theo and Pearl.

Jimbo He flunked the bar three times.

INT. N.A.S.A. - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

-- Harry shows Quincy his DRAWINGS of the DRILLING ARM - the way 
Harry wants it.

-- Harry, A.J. and Quincy work with the TURBO PROP ENGINE, 
transforming it into  a JET FUEL GENERATOR.

Quincy We'll run your liquid oxygen from the shuttle through a 
tube into the  intake manifold. No problem.

A.J. I figured out how to bring up the slag. Direct the jet 
turbine's exhaust  down the drill pipe. It'll blow the stuff 
right up the hole. 

Harry Good, A.J. Good.

-- Chick, Bennie, Bear, Jumbo welding new pieces of the DRILLING 
ARM together.  The Roughnecks have changed. Chick and Bennie now 
have crew-cuts. 

-- A.J., Harry, Max and Tito build the drilling arm.

EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE TAKE OFF AREA

TWO X-71 SHUTTLES in the hanger. TECHNICIANS scramble around, 
preparing the  shuttles for the mission.

Harry 
(points)
 From all of your intel, the deepest fault line is here. This is  
my sweet spot. If I can get a clean hole in there, She'll blow in 
half.... 

Golden ....and the two pieces will slide right past us. You 
cannot shatter it.  Getting hit with 20 smaller asteroids is as 
bad as one big one. You have to  drill, plant the nuke,  lift 
off, and detonate -- all before the asteroid reaches this  
position. 
(demonstrates position)
 You have eight hours. Remember it. You must  detonate by this 
point or,  the two halves will hit us. 

Harry nods and walks off.

Sharp Drill an eight-hundred foot hole in eight hours? Is that 
possible?

Harry doesn't like to be questioned --

Harry You just worry about getting me on that rock, Colonel. Let 
me worry  about the drilling.

A moment of conflict between them.

EXT. JOHNSON CENTE - ASTRONAUT TRAINING - DAY

ONE OF THE ARMADILLOS, complete with drilling arm, sits at the 
bottom of the  tank. Harry and six Roughnecks are already at the 
bottom, in pressure suits and  helmets. 

Golden, Quincy, Clark, Sharp, Truman, and all of the N.A.S.A. 
BRASS, observe.

A.J. is the last to enter the tank.

INT. N.A.S.A. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - UNDERWATER

A.J. descend to the tank's bottom. Harry, Chick, Bennie, Max and 
Tito are in  bulky white pressure suits. Jimbo and Bear wear the 
largest pressure suits ever  made. They talk through their helmet 
radio links. 

One drilling arm starts turning. The Roughnecks turn toward a 
STACK OF 20 FOOT  LONG STAINLESS STEEL DRILLING PIPES on the 
tank's bottom. ABOVE WATER - SIDE OF  TRAINING TANK

Golden hits a stopwatch.

Golden 
(into intercom)
 Go.

INT. N.A.S.A. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - UNDERWATER

Bear and Jimbo grab a pipe string and handle onto the mock-up 
drill arm. They  clamp it on. Bennie and Chick screw a drill bit 
onto the pipe string. They are  good, very good. The work with 
the manic intensity of a pit crew at Indy. 

Harry Done!

ABOVE WATER - SIDE OF TANK

Golden hits his stopwatch. Smiles. The N.A.S.A. Brass is 
impressed.

Golden These guys are fast. Harry, interior gauge check.

INT. N.A.S.A. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY TANK - UNDERWATER

Harry We're on A.J.

A.J. Let's see what this baby can do.

Harry and A.J. move the Armadillo's AIRLOCK DOOR. It has an 
exterior open/close  button. Harry punches it. The side door 
opens. Harry enters, then A.J. 

INT. ARMADILLO - UNDERWATER

Harry and A.J., still underwater, climb inside. Harry presses the 
PRESSURIZATION  button. Simulating pressurisation in space, the 
water in the cab is blown out,  and air WHOOSHES IN. 

Harry and A.J. sit dripping in the watertight cab. Through the 
front window WE  SEE the other Roughnecks in the tank. Harry 
unlocks his neck seals. Pulls off  his helmet. 

Harry Lose the helmet, A.J.

A.J. snaps out of it. His hands go instinctively to the helmet 
and in one  motion...CLICK. It's off.

Harry 
(clicks radio)
 We're in. Run the simulation.

The interior PRESSURE GUGE NEEDLES and MONITORS 
(engine torque, drill direction,  etc.)
 start bobbing. The drill starts to cut into a BLOCK OF CONCRETE. 

Golden 
(V.O)
 How's she look?

Harry Torque adjuster's good. Fuel level good. A.J., downhole 
pressure?

A.J. We can do better. I'm increasing the RPM's to seven 
thousand. We can get  more torque.

Golden 
(V.O)
 Negative, A.J. Don't exceed ix thousand. Not on this run.

A.J. Relax. I built this thing. She's got more in her. Increasing 
the RPM's.

Golden 
(V.O)
 Negative, A.J. A.J. increases the RPM's. The gauge starts to 
rise. The N.A.S.A. Brass shifts  uneasily in their seats. They're 
not accoutomed to seeing their astronauts  disobey orders. 

Golden 
(V.0)
 
(cont'd)
 A.J., shut the Armadillo down now

A.J. We can push it, further. Let's see what she can do.

Suddenly, the RPM''s shoot into the red. A red siren spins in the 
control room.  The Armadillo SHAKES violently. The DRILLING BIT 
grinds to nothing. The  Armadillo BLOWS a tranny. 

Harry's eyes close. He's pissed.

IN THE CONTROL ROOM

The N.A.S.A. Brass looks to Golden. One of them shakes their 
head. Sharp and  Golden exchange a look. Sharp shakes his head. 
INSIDE THE TANK

A.J. presses a button and the cabin, simulating 
"depressurisation" in space,  begins to fill with water.

INT. NEUTRL BUOYANCY TANK - SIDE OF TANK - DAY

Everyone around him just watches, as A.J. climbs out of the tank. 
After a  minute, A.J. looks up, sees all the eyes in the room on 
him. 

EXT. CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

Harry is outside, smoking a Coheba. Harry runs his hand over a 
SMALL METAL MEDAL  that hangs from his neck. Golden approaches. 

Golden A.J.'s off the team. We need a list of names from you to 
fill the slot.

Harry A.J. would be the first name on my list.

Golden We don't want independent thinkers. And we don't need 
heroes. We need a  team.

Harry You have to have confidence in the men you send up. I 
understand that.  But I'm the one that has to land on that rock. 
Not you. 
(firm)
 I pick my own  team. 

Golden One shot. Pull him in line or send him home.

INT . HUB OF ROCKET SIMULATOR - NIGHT

A.J. and Grace are there talking. Grace is on A.J.'s lap.

A.J. I pushed it, I screwed up.

Grace These astronauts train for years for what you're training 
for in a few  days.

A.J. I don't know why I didn't just listen to them.

Grace So, tomorrow you listen.

A.J. and Grace share a look.

A.J. I love you, Grace.

A N.A.S.A. Tech approaches.

N.A.S.A. Technician Harry wants to see you.

INT. DESIGN AND PROTOTYPE ROOM - NIGHT

Harry and A.J. stand in the centre of a high-tech supply room. 
SPARE PARTS from  shuttles, PROTOTYPES and WORK TOOLS are 
everywhere. 

Harry You tell me what the hell you think you're doing?

A.J. I'm trying to work with the team.

Harry Bullshit. You're trying to lead this team. You're trying to 
be me.  You're not me.

A.J. What do you want? You want me to quit?

Harry If you can't bury this cowboy shit, yeah, I want you to 
quit.

A.J. I don't have to prove anything to anybody, Harry.

Harry I listen to N.A.S.A., you listen to me. That's the chain. 
Either you  follow it, or you're done.

A.J. I'll follow it.

Harry I stood up for you, because I've made a life of proving 
people wrong.

Harry's hand slides down to the medal hanging from his neck.

Harry 
(cont'd)
 When I was about your age, I was in Galveston, Texas. I scraped  
together some money, bought some old equipment, a little land. I 
set up a rig  and drilled my first hole. Then I sat there and 
watched her soak up the sun for six  months - waiting for this 
baby to pop. Everybody told me to quit. I wouldn't  listen. My 
wife ran off with a drill-rigger, left me with Grace. Everybody 
in town thought I  was a fool. But I stayed with it. And in the 
last hour of the last day, she  popped. She spit out that black 
gold and I danced in it like a wild Indian. 
(reflective )
 I  captured the magic 
(holding medal)
 This is the last piece of pipe that struck  gold that day. 

Harry takes off the medal. Sets it on the table. He grabs a 
cutting vice and  cuts the medal in two perfect halves. He hands 
one half to A.J. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Here, take it up there.

QUICK MONTAGE

Inside the neutral buoyancy tank -- Harry's crew goes through all 
DRILLS one  final time 
(final mission checks)
 in quick succession. Everything runs  perfectly. The Armadillo 
is rebuilt and shown functioning without error. A.J.  works as 
part of the team. 

INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

The hour of the mission. The two teams sit in the orange N.A.S.A. 
flight  pressure suits. Golden enters and stands before the room. 

Golden In the book of Revalations, the Bible speaks of a final 
day on Earth,  when all mankind shall perish, shall cease to 
exist. This day is known as  Armageddon. 
(firm)
 Right  now, that day conflicts with six billion schedules. 
(beat)
 For the  first time in the history of this planet, s species 
possesses the technology to  prevent it's own  extinction. 
(beat)
 I've been with N.A.S.A. my entire adult life.  Eleven years as 
an astronaut, another fifteen on the ground at Mission Control.  
Twenty-six years I've had  to answer one question -- why? Why 
more money? Why the race for  space? Why do we need to know what 
is up there? 
(beat)
 When we come through  this, I'll take  comfort in the fact that 
I won't ever have to answer those  questions again. You are our 
warriors up there. You are our last hope. God be  with you. 

The crew stands......

EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - RUNWAY - DAY

Two sleek BLACK LEAR JETS are parked on the runway. Harry studies 
them. Grace  approaches.

Harry You know I was thinking, Gracie. Over the years, I should 
have patted  you on the back more....

Grace Dad, you don't need --

Harry No father has ever been prouder of his child, Gracie. I 
want you to know  that.

Grace's reaction makes it clear that Harry has never said 
anything like this  before.

Grace I love you, Dad.

Harry I love you too, Gracie.

Grace 
(as they hug)
 Keep an eye on A.J. for me.

Harry climbs up the metal stairs --

A.J. and the rest of Harry's crew comes out of the building. A.J. 
moves to Grace  as she watches her father disappear into the jet. 

A.J. Excuse me. 
(Grace turns)
 You're really insanely gorgeous and I was jost  sort of 
wondering if you -- 

Grace I'm engaged. But my father hasn't given him his blessing so 
you might  still have a chance. 
(smiles, then serious)
 Promise me you won't do anything  stupid up there.

A.J. nods. They kiss passionately. Harry's crew sees this and 
applauds. Grace  blushes, embarrassed.

A.J. I love you, Grace.

Grace I love you. Come back, Okay?

Harry's crew boards LEAR JET 2. A.J. starts toward LEAR JET 1. 
Grace watches him  walk away, eyeing his suit.

Grace A.J.--

A.J. 
(turning)
 Yeah?

Grace When you get back, ask them if you can kep the suit 
(winks)
 It's kind of  sexy.

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - BY SHUTTLE FREEDOM

The cone-shaped noses of the two X-71's are towering silhouettes 
against the  sun. Massive CRAWLERS move the shuttles to the 
launch tower. 

EXT. SHUTTLES FREEDOM & INDEPENDENCE LAUNCH - DAY

Seen from a distance as silhouettes behind a sun-soaked sky, 
sixteen figures  walk toward us. As they grow closer, WE SEE the 
intense game faces of Harry,  A.J., Bennie, Chick, Jumbo, Tito, 
Rockhound, Max and others approaching the  launch site. They look 
like N.A.S.A.'s version of the "Dirty Dozen." 

Harry carries a LARGE MYSTERIOUS METAL CASE, that we've not seen 
before now.

INT. LAUNCH TOWER ELEVATOR - LATER

Harry exits the elevator and start to walk to the CATWAL to the 
Freedom shuttle.  Harry carries his suitcase.

N.A.S.A. Tech 1 Sir, was that case authorised for transport?

N.A.S.A. Tech 2 Our weight to fuel ratio's calibrated to the 
kilogram, sir.  How much does that weigh?

Harry Sixty pounds.

N.A.S.A. Tech 1 That can't go up with you, sir.

Harry Wait here.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AFTERNOON

Harry enters the cabin. N.A.S.A.'s crack seven-member "Strap-in-
Team" goes to  work. Harry's crew are outfitted with their 
HELMETS and CHUTE PACKS. Each step  is methodical, each piece of 
equipment is checked and rechecked. 

Harry Hey you. Yeah you. Come here.

A YOUNG N.A.S.A. TECH approaches. Harry gestures at a row of 
METAL COMPONENTS  housed in the wall.

Harry What's all this crap?

N.A.S.A. Technician 
(pointing to various)
 Multi-track C.D. player.  Anti-gravity hand washer, utensil 
washer, and micro-wave oven. 
(proud)
 We worked  hard to make the X-71 feel  more like home. 

Harry just looks at the kid.

EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - BY SHUTTLE FREEDOM - DAY

Metal components one after the other come out of the shuttle 
hatchway and SLAM  into a heap on the lake bed. Harry then 
appears in the hatchway. 

Harry We don't need music and we don't mind dirty utensils.

Harry picks up his LARGE METAL CASE and ducks back inside the 
Freedom. The  N.A.S.A Techs stare at the ruined components at 
their feet.

Clark Freedom, Independence. You're looking good. Prepare to 
start docking  procedures at the MIR.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM

Sharp addresses the crews of both shuttles over the radio --

Sharp Listen up -- the MIR will be spinning to give us gravity so 
we can work  faster. You might feel queasy or dizzy. We'll dock, 
transfer the fuel, then  detach from the MIR.  Fast and safe. 
This stuff is very volatile. 

INT. RUSSIAN MIR SPACE STATION - DOCKING PORT

Lev is working feverishly, running highly insulated liquid oxygen 
and hydrogen  PROPELLANT TRANSFER HOSES from the MIR's several 
LABORATORY and LIVING MODULES  to the MIR's twin docking ports. 

A BLUE INDICATOR LIGHT FLASHES. Lev looks out of the MIR's 
portside window. His  eyes light up. He smiles.

EXT. SPACE - LOW EARTH ORBIT - MIR DOCKING PORTS

Freedom and Independence approach the MIR station. The MIR is T-
shaped, with  TWIN DOCKING PORTS at each end of the T's crossbar.

INT. CENTRAL ROOM - CENTER HUB OF MIR

Harry, Bennie, and Lev are talking in the combination kitchen/ 
rec room of the  MIR -- a little bigger than a walk-in closet. 
Lev grabs a VIDEO CAMERA and  starts video-taping Harry and 
Bennie. 

Lev I hear rumour on radio. My country broke. No steaks in 
freezer. They plan  to sell me and the MIR 
(moving in closer, conspiratorial)
 Can you confirm this? 

Bennie We wouldn't know. What's the camera?

Lev Oh, I also di-rec-tor. Russian cinema. MIR movies. Each has 
title.

Lev grabs remote control. On a large TELEVISION screen VARIOUS 
IMAGES OF LEV  appear.

Lev "Lev loves cargo." "Lev sleeps." "Lev prepares for 
Americans." "Lev gets  bored so he gets drunk." Funny but...too 
long. 

Bennie Looks like you have a lot of free time on your hands.

Lev Yeah. I alone by myself.

Watts comes into the room. The first woman Lev has seen in a 
very, very long  time. Lev moves the camera all over her. 

Lev Hello, fellow space colleague.

Watts nods.

Watts I'll be in the docking port.

Lev Please allow me to escort you. 
(as they walk out)
 You California girl?

INT. MIR SPACE STATION - REAR MODULES

Harry and Bennie enter the MIR's rearmost module. Two propellant 
hoses run into  TWIN PROPELLANT OUTPUT VALVES on a rear panel.

Lev, Sharp, and Chick are walking toward the shuttles. The 
ELECTRICITY in the  MIR FLUTTERS. Lev stops. Sharp stops. Lev 
looks over his shoulder toward the  central hub. A chill runs 
down his spine. DOLLY INTO LEV'S EYES - 

Lev

For a long moment Golden just stands there, saying nothing.

Golden I work for the President of the United States. 
(long pause; looks over  at Collinswood)
 But I think it's my duty as a scientist to tell the world what  
is happening. Three,  days ago a manned space mission was sent to 
intercept an asteroid  which has entered the Earth's orbit. 
(REPORTERS all chatter)
 This is a difficult  mission. In all  frankness, it is the most 
difficult mission anyone has ever flown.  
(beat)
 A little over fifty years ago we sent our Armed Forces half-way 
around  the world to save the  world from an evil empire that 
threatened mass extinction. The men  and women of this nation 
united, answered the calland preserved our freedom.  
(beat)
 Once again  we face a threat to our way of life. And once again 
we look to our  military to preserve our future. The men and

 How we doin', Freedom, over?

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT

Watts Nearing the Dark Side, Houston, a minute thirty and 
counting.

EXT. SPACE - THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON

On the Moon's opposite side, THE ASTEROID roars into frame, its 
trailing  fragments motionless in relation to each other, 
travelling as a swarm, a cluster  of debris. As it nears the 
Moon's gravitational field -- 

TRAILING FRAGMENTS peel away, drawn into the Moon by its lunar 
gravity. A  relatively DEBRIS-LESS CORRIDOR begins to form on one 
side of the asteroid. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL

Skip Twenty seconds till we lose radio contact, Director.

Clark You're on your own, Willie. You've got to raise your

(pressurization, oxygen,  electrical power, fuel capacity, etc.)
 GO DEAD. 

Golden They'll be pullin' nine and half G's for eleven minutes,

Flip Yeah. That Russian monkey in 1957.

Clark We'll pick 'em up again in sixteen minutes, Danny.

Golden If they're still alive.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AROUND DARK SIDE OF MOON

The radio is STATIC.

Watts Rockets ready for burn, Willie.

Sharp 
(over shoulder to Harry and others)
 Time to suck it up, people. Just  pretend you're on the big 
roller coaster at Disneyland...
(mumbles under breath)
  ...times a  hundred.... 

Sharp reaches for the BOOSTER ROCKET SWITCH. He gives Watts one 
last look, then  throws the switch. 

EXT. DARK SIDE OF THE MOON - FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE 

Freedom and Independence fire their BOOSTERS. The two SHUTTLES 
explode forward,  hurtling around the Moon's DARK SIDE with a 
degree of increasing velocity never  before experienced by man. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - REAR CABIN

Harry, Chick, Bear, and Max get hit with the first G-Forces. 
Their torsos press  back against their seats. They flex their 
arms, breathing deeply, expanding  their chest cavities as they 
were taught in training. 

Harry I hate to fly, I hate to fly, I hate to fly....

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE - REAR CABIN 

A.J., Lev, Bennie, Jimbo, and Tito get slammed back by the first 
wave of  G-Forces. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Watts reads her VELOCITY INDICATOR under G-Forces so bad she 
speaks through  clenched teeth

Watts Fourteen thousand....sixteen thousand...twenty thousand

Silence. Tension. Technicians stare at their consoles.

Clark They're hittin' the big G's right about...now.

Golden Come on, Willie, you can do this....

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - REAR CABIN

Excruciating, gut-wrenching, turn-your-intestines-inside-out G-
Forces. HARRY and  CHICK'S FACIAL MUSCLES distort hideously; 
their rubbery cheeks and lips flatten  out. They continue anti-G 
exercises, tensing every muscle, trying to keep blood  flow 
evenly distributed. 

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE

A.J. and Bennie's distorted faces, likewise, go through the anti 
G-Force  exercises, tensing every muscle.

EXT. LUNAR ORBIT - MASTER SHOT

IN ONE AWE-INSPIRING SHOT, we see -- 

Shuttles Freedom and Independence rocketing around the Moon in 
darkness, further  and further, until finally WE SEE, 
increasingly, a staggering, mind blowing  visual -- 

THE ASTEROID'S TRAILING DEBRIS appears, a HUGE CLOUD of tiny ICE 
CHUNKS AND  PEBBLES, and much larger BOULDERS, and ICEBERGS the 
size of houses, the ice  glinting with reflected sunlight, 
throwing off a dazzling SPECTRAL SHOWER OF  LIGHT in all 
directions, and finally -- 

THE ASTEROID'S HUGE CORE - it has just cleared the Moon and now 
flies straight  for it's destination - the cool, blue PLANET 
EARTH dead ahead across an expanse  of space. 

Shuttles Freedom and Independence slingshot out of the Lunar 
orbit and fall in  behind the asteroid, settling into the DEBRIS-
LESS CORRIDOR. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Continued STATIC on the radio. Everyone sits nervously waiting. 
Suddenly the  shuttles' computerised SYSTEM MONITORS begin to 
click back on. 

Clark Freedom, come in, over. Independence, come in, over.

Nothing. Golden grabs the mike.

Golden Willie? Come in, over. Willie, can you hear me...? 

Total silence. A pin could drop. The N.A.S.A. Technicians stare 
nervously at the  Central Board. 

Then, suddenly through static

Sharp 
(V.0)
 Houston, you gotta see this to believe it.... 

Elation. Held breaths are exhaled. Golden and N.A.S.A. 
TECHNICIANS smile. No one  is more relieved than Grace. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Sharp and Watts stare through the windshield at -- 

THE ASTEROID, below them and dead ahead. We get our first 
(and only temporary)
  clear glimpse of the designated landing field, a relatively 
smooth, unobstructed  plane on the asteroid's surface. 

Harry is green, looks like he's gonna blow chunks. 

Sharp We're awake, we're not pukin'....
(looks over shoulder at Harry)
  ....well, Harry is. And we got a clear path to the target. 
Houston, over. 

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE 

Truman smiles. 

Truman Copy that, Freedom. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Clark gives Golden a thumbs up. 

Clark We'll take you in, guys. 

EXT. SHUTTLES FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE 

Freedom, in the lead, and Independence, following to the rear and 
side, descend  through the debris-less corridor to the waiting 
asteroid. 

Suddenly a CLOUD OF ICE AND PEBBLES wafts in front of the 
Shuttles. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM COCKPIT 

In one terrifying second, visibility is cut to twenty feet. Then 
BANG! BANG!  BANG! BANG! 

PEBBLES and SMALL ICE CHUNKS strike the windshield, chipping and 
denting it. The  impacts are violent; the interior is buffeted 
around. It's the space equivalent  of bad hailstorm. 

Sharp Damn it....! 

Clark 
(V.O)
 What is it, Willie? 

Sharp Problem, Houston. We've got debris all over us! 

REAR OF COCKPIT - Harry and the others, alarmed, are buffeted 
around violently. 

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE - COCKPIT 

No visibility here either. Ice chunks and pebbles BANG against 
the windshield. 

Truman I've got no visibility. I've lost orientation to the 
target! 

Suddenly, as sudden as it came, the debris clears. 

But a HUGE ICE BOULDER the size of a three-story building twirls 
into  Independence's path. It hits a BOULDER which collides with 
another. 

Truman Big guy! Dead ahead! 

Truman stabs his directional thruster button. Shuttle 
Independence veers to the  right.... 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Sharp hits his directional thruster, and Freedom veers to the 
left.... 

EXT. THROUGH THE ASTEROID'S TAIL 

Freedom goes left, Independence right, splitting the ice boulder. 

Freedom clears the ice boulder by a foot. Independence, not so 
lucky, clips the  ice boulder, ripping her left thruster clean 
off. With one thruster,  Independence careens out of control, 
twirling and spinning. 

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE 

Truman 
(panicked)
 I lost left thruster! No control! I have no control! 

In the Independence's cargo bay, one of the Armadillos RIPS free 
from its  moorings and plunges through the CARGO BAY DOORS. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Sharp steers Freedom past the ice boulder.

Watts Where's the other ship....?!

Suddenly the Independence, with a RIPPED OPEN CARGO BAY DOOR, 
careens directly  across Freedom's path, filling Freedom's 
cockpit window, nearly colliding with  her. 

Sharp hits his thrusters, veering away from the damaged 
Independence. 

Sharp and Watts watch Independence twirling toward the asteroid. 
Suddenly  BANG!!! 

The INDEPENDENCE'S ERRANT ARMADILLO strikes the Freedom's nose, 
spider-webbing  the WINDSHIELD. Sharp and Watts recoil in terror. 
Watts SCREAMS. 

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE 

The fuselage is spinning. A.J., Bennie and the others are in 
terror. In the  cockpit, Truman SCREAMS over the radio

Truman Houston, MAYDAY, MAYDAY, we're going down! 

The Shuttle's roof collides with a rock. We hear SCRAPING METAL. 
The CEILING  dents in, dislodging INTERIOR CEILING PANELS filled 
with wires and electrical  components; they rain down on A.J. and 
the others. 

Choas. The SPARKING CABIN fills with smoke. 

Truman Crew, go to life support! 

Everyone grabs for their HELMET, frantically trying to get them 
on. A.J. gets  his on, but he can't lock his neck seal. He 
fidgets with the little SEAKL LOCKS. 

A.J. rips off the helmet. It slips from his fingers and floats 
off through the  zero-g cabin! 

A.J. Goddamn it! 

A.J. throws off his seat harnesses and goes after his helmet. In 
zero-gravity,  the sides of the twirling cockpit revolve around 
A.J. as he moves. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

We hear a CACOPHONY OF VOICES and BANGING ROCKS against 
Independence's fuselage. 



Truman MAYDAY, HOUSTON, MAYDAY....!! 

Golden and the N.A.S.A. personnel can only sit and listen, 
horrified, impotent  to do anything..... 

INT. SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE - REAR CABIN 

AT THE BACK OF THE CABIN - A.J. reaches his helmet and 
frantically gets it back  on. The fuselage is still twirling 
around him. 

Bennie, strapped in and freaking out, throws off his seat harness 
and bolts for  the SAFETY EMERGENCY HATCH equipped with EXPLOSIVE 
RELEASE CHARGES. 

Truman sees Bennie at the Emergency Hatch. BIG ROCKS smash off 
the windshield in  front of Truman; the windshield's safety glass 
is weakened, splintered, to the  point of bursting. 

Truman Get away from that door!!!! 

Bennie is wild-eyed, crazed. 

Bennie Go to hell, man, I ain't dyin' on this thing!!!! 

A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

A ROCK SMASHES through the windshield, gouging into Truman. 
Depressurisation.  Truman and Co-pilot Weston are sucked out 
through the windshield. 

Bennie BLOWS the Emergency Hatch's explosive charges. The hatch 
door pulls  Bennie out into space...to his death.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - REAR CABIN 

Harry and the Roughnecks are SMASHED around in their seats. 

IN THE COCKPIT - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 

A BOULDER the size of a house looms downslope. Shuttle Freedom is 
skidding  straight for it. 

Sharp and Watts watch helplessly as the Shuttle skids toward the 
boulder. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE 

Freedom hits a SMALLER ROCK, which changes its skid angle. It 
clears the boulder  by a foot and skids to a stop at the base of 
the slope. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - REAR CABIN 

Harry and the others JOLT to a stop. No one moves. No one 
breathes. It's scary  as hell.

Nothing. Skip buries his face in his hands. Flip chews his 
pencil. Golden,  having lost one crew already, twists his wedding 
ring. 

Sharp 
(V.O)
 Houston, it's Freedom. We just landed on this son-of-a-bitch,

Golden and the Technicians breath a sigh of relief.

Watts 
(V.O)
 What's the status of Independence?

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - REAR CABIN

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HARRY, as he waits for Houston's response to 
this last  question.

Sharp 
(V.O)
 We lost her.

CAMERA TIGHT ON HARRY. He's lost men before, many men on oil 
rigs. But not  A.J.....

Chick 
(O.S.)
 Harry, Harry, Jesus Christ, this can't happen....

Harry snaps out of it, turns to Chick.

Harry It did happen. They're gone. Deal with it. We got a lot of 
work to do.

Harry unharnesses himself and rises.

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL

Golden looks at Grace. She looks back. A tear slides off her 
cheek to the  console. Harry's daughter doesn't say a word, or 
break down. She just quietly  rises and walks to the back of the 
room. Grace rubs her bare ring finger. A  BEAT. 

CAMERA SPIES the ZERO BARRIER CLOCK. Seven hours, 52 minutes, 000 
feet drilled.

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM

Chick, Bear, and Max prepare to disembark, donning helmet and 
glove assemblies,  clicking neck and wrist seals into locking 
position. 

Harry comes into the cockpit. Watts is flipping switches and 
reading gauges.  Sharp's on the radio. A haze fills the cockpit. 

Watts Engine ignition system isn't responding.

INTERCUT - FREEDOM/ MISSION CONTROL

Golden What's the problem?

Flip Engine ignition. Starting diagnostics.

Sharp Houston, I don't know where we are. Tell me how far we 
overshot Harry's  sweep spot. Advise on currant location, over. 

Skip motions to Golden and Clark. They hurry over to his console. 
On Skip's  computer screen is a MAP OF THE ASTEROID containing 
its geological fault lines. 

Skip They overshot their landing 26 miles. There's a different 
fault line, but  it's deeper.

Golden How much deeper? 

Skip Two hundred feet. 

Golden exchanges a look with Temple. 

Golden Harry, your fault line's fifty yards off the starboard 
side. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Harry stalks to the rear. 

Harry Rockhound. 

Rockhound Yes, sir. 

Harry I'm gonna get you some surface samples and you're gonna 
tell me what I'm  up against. 

Rockhound Rocks are my life. 

Watts Willie, we might be stuck. 

Sharp exchanges grim looks with Pitts and Fisk over this bad 
information. 

Harry The good news just keeps comin'. Load up, guys. 

Sharp watches Harry and the guys exit to the rear. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Freedom's cargo door opens; its RAMP unfolds to the asteroid's 
surface. HARRY  looks out. 

Freedom is in a small, cold, dark valley. The asteroid's face is 
tilted away  from the Earth and Sun. THE MOON is huge on our rear 
horizon. The place is  eerily calm and tranquil. Harry walks down 
the ramp onto the asteroid surface. 

INT. FREEDOM CARGO BAY - INSIDE ARMADILLO 

Chick, at the Armadillo's controls, engages gears. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The Armadillo rumbles out of the cargo bay, carrying Bear, Max, 
Rockhound and  Pitts over the wheel wells. 

The Armadillo drives 50 yards from Freedom and parks. The guys 
hop down, turning  on their PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS. Bear begins 
off-loading 20-foot long DRILLING  PIPES. 

Harry takes readings from a SEISMIC INSTRUMENT. Pulls out a SOIL 
SAMPLER, a  small shovel on a telescoping shaft. He digs it in 
with his boot. Clang. It  doesn't dig in at all. He walks around, 
stabbing it into the ground. CLANG.  CLANG. 

Chick exchanges nervous looks with Bear and Max. 

Harry Bedrock. Whole goddamn place is Bedrock. 

Harry examines the ground. Not satisfied. He finds a spot he 
likes; digs an "X"  in the soil with his boot. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Here. Fire up the Bad Boy bit. 

Chick, Max and Bear go into action. Max screws the Bad Boy bit 
onto the first  drilling pipe. Bear hoists the pipe up to the 
DRILLING MECHANISM, muscles it  onto the DRILL DRIVE, then clamps 
it on. 

Harry plugs a TEE and GOLF BALL into the craggy surface. He 
waggles his club, a  5-IRON HEAD, screwed onto the soil sampler's 
shaft. 

Pitts What's he doing? 

Chick Wildcatters are superstitious, Colonel. Harry does this 
every time we  break ground. 

He swings....WHACK! The ball rockets off the tee and keeps 
going...and going... 

Harry HOLE NUMBER 77. Let 'er rip! 

Chick throws a lever, lowering the BAD BOY BIT into the rocky, 
icy surface. Down  the drill pipe goes, unimpeded, 10 feet just 
like that. It suddenly stops. It's  turning, but not drilling. 
Bear and Max approach the drill hole. 

Bear What in hell's down there?

Harry Chick, bring 'er up!

Chick throws it in reverse. The DRILLING ARM reverses out of the 
hole. The Bad  Boy bot comes up CHEWED TO SHREDS. Harry and the 
guys examine the drill bit.  Everyone exchanges a worried look. 

Max The dream. It's my dream. 

Harry Shut up, Max. 
(looks at Bear)
 What's with the look? Get that off your  face. You've seen bits 
get eaten before. 

Bear Not after ten feet. 

Chick The first ten better be the worst ten. 

Harry Go to the Terminator. 

Chick grabs Harry's mysterious METAL CASE. Harry pops open the 
metal case,  revealing THE TERMINATOR, a super high-tech bit. 

Harry I designed you. I built you. You are the enemy of all 
subterranean shit.  You are the king. It's showtime. 

Harry passes it to Bear, who screws it onto the drilling pipe, 
Rockhound scoops  up a COLLECTION OF DOWNHOLE ROCK CHIPS. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 Hit it, Chick. 

The DRILL PIPE turns. Sediment comes WHOOSHING out of the hole 
and -- THE DRILL  PIPE descends like a bitch. 

INT. FREEDOM 

Sharp, Watts, Pitts and Fisk have a PANEL removed, exposing the 
guts of  Freedom's wiring and components. Watts and Sharp are 
inside the panel, scrunched  against the fuselage wall, unbolting 
a large COMPONENT. Watts hands Pitts and  Fisk a SMALLER 
COMPONENT. 

Watts Unbolt the housing. There and there. 

INT. ARMADILLO 

The rock CHIPS spew into the COLLECTOR in front of ROCKHOUND. 
Harry looks on. 

Harry What do you make of that? 

Rockhound picks up several chips. Draws them close to his eyes. 

Rockhound Oh my. Oh my, my, my. This isn't rock. It's uhh, it's 
uhh,  it's......iron. 

Harry Iron deposit? 

Rockhound 
(shakes head)
 No. It's been melted. Forged rather. I've only seen  this once - 
at a volcano in Hawaii. 
(looks up at Harry)
 You're drilling into a  big slab of cast-iron, Mr. Stamper.

Something moves on the ceiling. REVEAL A.J. hanging upside down, 
caught in the  twisted fuselage skin. A.J. cuts himself down. He 
twirls to the ground. Sees  LEGS MOVING UNDER RUBBLE.

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

Chick and Bear screw on a new length of drill pipe. Chick engages 
the gears. The  drill pipe descends. THE TERMINATOR is working. 
Harry approaches from the  shuttle. 

Harry How far? 

Chick Almost 60 feet and startin' to kick ass! 

Suddenly GRRRR. CLANG. BANG. The drill pipe stops. Harry walks 
over to the hole. 



Chick 
(cont'd)
 That did not sound good. 

Harry Increase r.p.m. 

Chick throws the lever. The drill pipe turns faster, but still 
doesn,t descend.  Harry and the guys crowd around the drilling 
hole. 

Max Freaky, man.

Bear I got one of those big-time crappy feelings about this.

Harry We gotta get more power down to this bit. 
(thinks; looks up at Chick)
  Full throttle.

Chick You sure?

Harry Yeah, I'm sure.

Chick I don't think she can take it.

Harry She's gonna have to.

Chick The last time we ran her at full throttle we ripped her up!

Harry I don't have time to argue, Chick, now goddamn it, throttle 
up, or I'll  come up there and do it for you.

Chick reluctantly throws the lever to FULL THROTTLE. The TURBINE 
ENGINE ROARS.  The DRILL PIPE turns faster in the hole. The 
TURBINE ENGINE is shaking the  Armadillo. The drill pipe is 
descending again. Suddenly BANG!! The CLUTCH  rupture, spewing 
the CLUTCH PLATES and GEARS into space.

Harry Stop!

Chick throws it into reverse. Up comes THE TERMINATOR, CHEWED TO 
SHREDS. Bear  and Max look at it, then each other. Very worried 
now. 

Bear The Terminator's terminated.

Chick The clutch is dead.

Harry We're goin' to the second rig.

Harry stalks off toward the Shuttle.

Temple Golden, we are preparing for surface detonation.

Golden A surface detonation isn't going to do it, General. My 
scientists have  already told you that. It must be detonated 
inside the asteroid. The alternative  is that the Earth  will be 
bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as  catastrophic. 

Temple stares off pensively into the sky.

The ARMADILLO blasts through the cargo bay door. A.J. and Lev 
roll off away from  the Independence. 

A.J. cranes his neck looking out through the Armadillo. A RIDGE 
with THRE TALL  SPIRES is in the distance, ringed with LIGHT from 
Freedom's FLOOD LIGHTS. 

A half-smile from A.J hope. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Sharp comes back from the cockpit, carrying the detonator. 
Harry's on the phone  to Golden. 

Harry ...You told me that the only way to deal with this hunk 'o 
crud is to  get a nuke 1000 feet down. You sticking with that? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Firmly. 

Harry Great. Glad we have that understanding. 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 IF you're gonna pull this off, we have to have a little talk  
about time...and temperature. Zero Barrier's in two hours. 

Harry Wait...wait..what about temperature? When did temperatures 
come into the  picture? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Harry, your suits are good upto 150 degrees Celsius.... 

Harry And...? How hot is it going to get? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 We didn't anticipate you being on the asteroid so long. The  
clock is ticking... 

Harry How hot is it going to get?! 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Three hundred and fifty degrees. 

Harry's face drops. 

Harry Thanks for telling us now, Golden....I don't think my bits 
can handle  those kind of temperatures.... 

INT. FREEDOM - CARGO BAY 

Harry clicks off the radio. 

Watts We've still gotta fix this shuttle, Stamper. 

Harry Give me some more good news. You've got two new assistants 
who can fix  your shuttle. Bear, Max, hop to it. There's not a 
machine they can't fix. We can  handle the hole from here. 

EXT. SHUTTLE FRREDOM

The airlock opens. Sharp and Pitts are led out by Harry.

Harry Colonel Sharp, if we're going to blow this hole, you gotta 
help ME. I  need some more manpower....

EXT. FREEDOM DRILL SITE - MINUTES LATER

The SECOND ARMADILLO rumbles out of Freedom's cargo bay. Chick 
and the  Roughnecks work like a NASCAR pit crew. Sharp and Pitts 
lay on their backs  holding down a 1000 pound axle, fighting 
zero-g. 

Suddenly, the ground begins to tremble.

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - FRONT OF "THREE SPIRES RIDGE"

A.J.'s ARMADILLO rumbles over a little hill revealing the RIDGE 
WTH THREE SPIRES  directly in front of them. THE SUN is moving 
over the asteroid's FAR HORIZON,  causing a "sunrise." It is 
breathtaking, spiritual...and frighteningly bright. 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

A.J. Over the hill.

Suddenly, the ground under the vehicle shakes sharply. A.J. stops 
the Armadillo.

The ground around the vehicle heaves up and down. The GROUND 
SPLITS. One  TECTONIC PLATE rises 15 feet in the air. The ground 
breaks like a wave, up and  down. 

INT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE

Here, too, the ground shakes. Bear, terrified, drops a DRILL 
PIPE. Max is shaken  to the ground.

Chick is nearly thrown off the Armadillo.

Chick Clear the rig!!!

Chick jumps down, bouncing. Everybody gets the hell away from the 
drilling hole.

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO

The asteroid shakes violently, throwing A.J. and Lev around the 
cab. ROCKS BANK  down on the Armadillo's top and hood. The 
ASTEROID SURFACE continues splitting  apart across the slope's 
fall line. 

A.J. EARTHQUAKE!

The asteroid RUMBLES a few more seconds, then the quake slowly 
stops. All is  stll. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 Let's take a look. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE 

Lev gets out; he nervously paces back and forth across the lip of 
the fissure. 

Lev This bad. 
(repeating, mantra)
 Darth Vader. Darth Vader. 

A.J. Listen, Mr. Negative. Everyone thinks we're dead. We're not. 
So, suck it  up. Because if we don't drill that hole, six billion 
people are going to die.  And I'm not lettin' Harry Stamper get 
all the freaking credit for saving the world. 
(firm)
  We're gona do this, then we're going home. 

Lev I l-o-v-e this American confidence! Like John Wayne. 
(sotto)
 This why I  suspect you won Cold War. 

A.J. Hep me get these rocks over there. 

A.J. and Lev start dragging rocks to use as a "kicker ramp" for 
the jump. Lev is  oblivious. They pull embedded rock out, 
revealing DIAMONDS. A.J. holds up a  large chunk. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 This outta cut into a sweet wedding ring. 

Lev 
(holding chunk)
 With this I can rebuild my MIR. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Chick, Bear, and Max cautiously approach the drill hole. 
Everything seems okay.  Chick climbs back up to the drill-drive 
platform. 

Chick Back to work! 

Bear grabs the drill pipe and hoists it... back to work. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - "THREE SPIRES RIDGE" 

A.J. is walking along the GAPING, JAGGED FISSURE, 50 feet wide, 
50 feet deep,  stretching across the entire slope. 

Lev This bad, this very bad, very, very bad... 

A.J. Stick a cork in it, Lev. I'm tryin' to think. 

A.J. stares at the fissure, his eyes roaming from the 
fissure...to the  Armadillo...back to the fissure. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 Hop on the back. Get our weight distributed better. 

Lev 
(uncertain)
 And why to do this? 

A.J. Because I'm askin'. And turn your suit's thrusters off. 
Trust me, okay? 

A.J. gets in the Armadillo. Lev goes around back, climbs on the 
REAR BUMPER. He  clicks off his pressure suit's pro-gravity 
thrusters. 

Lev Okey-doke. 

The Armadillo begins backing down the slope. 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J. throws it in neutral. The Armadillo stops. 

A.J. Hey, Lev, we're gonna see what this Porche engine can do.... 

He throws it in drive. The Armadillo lurches ahead. 

EXT. A.J..'S ARMADILLO - BACK BUMPER 

The Armadillo's REAR TIRES CHURN FORWARD, slinging rocks and 
gravel which, in  zero-g, shoot off in a stream into space, never 
falling. Lev holds on for dear  life. 

A.J.'S Armadillo churns up the slope like a Bronco 4X4, slinging 
gravel, heading  for THE JAGGED FISSURE. It FLIES over the 
fissure's edge as -- 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

-- A.J. punches the Armadillo's PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTER "OFF" 
SWITCH. 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - ROOF 

-- the Armadillo's roof-mounted PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS shut down. 

EXT. ASTEROID - "THREE SPIRES RIDGE" - JAGGED FISSURE 

The Armadillo, no longer thrusting downwardly, flies across the 
jagged fissure  in zero-g. The heavy steel vehicle doesn't fall. 
It ascends, and amazingly,  shoots across the entire 50 foot 
expanse of jagged fissure. 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - BACK BUMPER 

Lev looks down. The FISSURE passes beneath him, then SOLID GROUND 
again. They've  cleared the fissure....but they're not coming 
down. 

Lev A.J., up is bad! Down! 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J. punches the PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTER "START" SWITCH. Nothing.... 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - BACK BUMPER 

The thruster nozzles SPUTTER, but no thrust. The Armadillo is 50 
feet off the  ground and still ascending...into outer space. Lev, 
his next stop being Planet  Mars, panics. He climbs the roof and 
peers inside the front windshield, POUNDING  ON THE WINDSHIELD. 

Lev Down! Not up! Up is bad! Down! 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

The Armadillo continues lifting into space, from which there is 
no return. A.J.  toggles the "start" switch. The swtich's 
INDICATOR LIGHT FLICKERS. 

A.J. HOLD ON, LEV, I GOT HER WORKIN'!! 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

Not quite. Only the right-front and right-rear THRUSTER NOZZLES 
fire, pushing  the right side downward, rolling the Armadillo 
over on its side. Lev, on the  bumper, clings to the rear-mounted 
TOW WINCH AND CABLE ASSEMBLY. 

Suspended in zero-g, on its side and in mid-air, the Armadillo is 
pushed by  thrusters, tires-first, against the SHEER, 90 DEGREE 
CLIFF FACE next to the  slope. All four Armadillo tires slam 
against the cliff. The Armadillo bounces  off. 

Lev, grabbing the Armadillo's TOWING CABLE, flies off the rear. 
The cable spools  out and LEV, hanging on for all he's worth, 
SLAMS against the cliff face and  descends.... 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J., lying sideways, keeps toggling the thruster START SWITCH. 
The indicator  light finally FLASHES "IN" and A.J. rams it into 
drive -- 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - CLIFF FACE / ARMADILLO 

-- the Armadillo, all four thrusters now working, drives sideways 
across the  cliff face dragging Lev, who bounces against the 
cliff face and gradually falls,  until he's bouncing on the 
asteroid surface. 

The Armadillo finally falls down the cliff face and skids to a 
stop. 

INT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO 

A.J., shaken, takes a deep breath and gets out. 

EXT. A.J.'S ARMADILLO - REAR 

A.J. walks to the rear. Lev splayed out 50 feet from the back of 
the Armadillo,  covered in asteroid surface dirt and grime, looks 
up at him. 

Lev Very bad idea, A.J. 

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

Harry orders his crew to start the drill up. The men drill a 
shitload of feet in  record time. They finally burst through the 
rock and hit easy sediment. 

The asteroid is spinning toward sunlight. Here, too, there is a 
sunrise. Bear's  face sweats inside the helmet. Chick's vision 
begins to blur. Tito takes a seat  on a nearby rock, exhausted. 

Chick Mutha...it's getting warm. 

Bear 
(worried)
 We got that sunrise, Harry. These bits are gonna fry up...... 

Suddenly the TRANSMISSION LINKAGE in the Armadillo BLOWS. 

Harry Goddamn it! 
(thinks)
 We'' take the tranny from the other rig! And if you  wanna 
complain about the heat, go to some other fucking 
asteroid....Toughen up. 

Sharp 
(to Roughnecks)
 Let's move it.....let's go, guys. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Chick and Bear yank the detached good TRANSMISSION HOUSING from 
inside Armadillo  2 and carry it across to Armadillo 1. 

INT. ARMADILLO 1 - CABIN 

Max finishes unbolting the BROKEN TRANSMISSION HOUSING. He passes 
it to Chick  who dumps it on the surface. Sharp and Truman work 
with Bear and Chick who feed  in the good transmission housing. 

Max presses the airlock. The doors close and the cabin 
pressurises. Max clicks  off his helmet. He begins installing the 
transmission housing and the linkage. 

EXT. ARMADILLO 1 

Chick and Bear, atop the drilling platform, begin installing the 
clutch plates  and transmission linkage. 

Harry Move guys, move it..... 

Bolting, bolting, bolting, connecting, connecting..... 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Skip is analysing the asteroid's THERMAL READINGS. A MULTI-
COLORED THERMAL IMAGE  MAP shows most of the asteroid is GREEN 
(no heat)
, but around the chosen landing  site are numerous RED SPOTS 
(heat)
. 

Skip Look at these thermals. This is BEFORE sunlight hits the 
drill site.  She's really heating up.... 

INT. ARMADILLO 

Max is bolting. The DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGE NEEDLE jolts. Max 
doesn't see it. He  keeps working. 

EXT. DRILLING SITE 

Harry's watching the work. Out of the corner of his eye... THE 
DRILLING ARM  KICKS. Harry turns to it. Nothing happens. His eyes 
move back to Chick and Bear,  then back to the drilling arm. It 
kicks up again. Just a few inches. 

Harry Chick. Unbolt the tranny. 

Chick We just put it in. 

Harry Do it. NOW. 

Chick, confused, starts unbolting the tranny. Suddenly the well 
kicks hard, one  foot high. Chick's jostled. BANG!! The RIG KICKS 
HARD, THREE FEET, bucking Chick  off. 

Chick scrambles back up to the drill platform. 

The ground shakes. a terrific TREMBLER rumbles through the 
valley. Harry, Max  and Bear cling to the side of the Armadillo. 
Chick's nearly thrown off. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 GET THE TRANNY OUTTA THERE! WE LOSE THE TRANNY, WE'RE DEAD  
MEN!! 

Harry climbs up to the DRILL PLATFORM. The GROUND SHAKES 
violently, throwing  harry and Chick around the top of the drill 
platform. 

Harry Max, you gotta get those bolts undone! 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max is furiously unbolting the TRANNY HOUSING. There are two 
bolts to go. He  ratches one off.... 

Max I'm doin' it, I'm doin' it. 

Max gets to the last bolt.... 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 Go Max, go Max, get the last bolt....! 

Max gets the last bolt undone. 

Max DONE!! 

EXT. ARMADILLO - DRILL PLATFORM 

Chick and Harry pull the unfastened TRANNY HOUSING out of the 
Armadillo as -- 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max stares at the DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGES, groping through the 
compartment for  his helmet. 

Max Pressure's through the roof! Shit, where's my helmet....!? 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Suddenly the DRILLING ARM jolts upward, lifting the ARMADILLO SIX 
FEET off the  ground. 

Chick She's gonna blow! 

Harry MAX, GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!!! 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max is thrown against a wall of the rear compartment. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The DRILLING ARM KICKS again, six feet this time, tossing the 
Armadillo over on  two wheels. 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max is SLAMMED against the wall again. Terrified, he grabs for 
his helmet and  locks the NECK SEALS. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

A DEEP RUMBLING emanates from the drilling hole, coming seemingly 
from the  ASTEROID'S CORE. Harry gets to his feet and SLAMS HIS 
FIST against the  Armadillo's SIDE. 

Harry CLEAR THE RIG! 

Everyone scatters.... 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max, helmet on, is frantically scrambling to the airlock, but 
there's no time... 



Max I CAN'T DEPRESSURIZE!! 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

WIth an awesome force, the DRILLING HOLE BLOWS. The DRILLING PIPE 
EXPLODES  upward, lifting the DRILLING ARM and the ENTIRE 
ARMADILLO VEHICLE with it. THE  ENTIRE RIG blows upward into 
space. 

INT. ARMADILLO - REAR COMPARTMENT 

Max punches the DOOR LOCK without depressurising the cabin and is 
sucked  violently out of the rear compartment into open space. 

EXT. SPACE OVER ASTEROID SURFACE 

FIFTY FEET OF DRILL PIPE, THE DRILLING ARM, and the entire 
ARMADILLO RIG with  MAX trailing, BLOWS into space. MAX'S FACE is 
a screaming mask of terror and  confusion, reaching out, but 
there's no one to catch him....Harry and the guys  watch in 
helpless silence as the drill rig and Max ascend into space. 

Chick Max.....No. No. No. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Skip motions to Golden. He comes over. 

Skip They just lost the rig. The hole blew out. 

Golden takes the news stoically. He thinks, looking across the 
room at Temple.  He looks at the clock. ONE HOUR AND FORTY 
MINUTES TO GO. 

Golden Say nothing. 

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

Silence. A stark tableau. Harry and the men standing there, just 
watching.  Devastated, confused, in shock. This is a total 
catastrophe. The mission is  over. 

Sharp nods to Pitts. Pitts picks up the REMOTE NUCLEAR DETONATOR. 

Sharp Stamper, you ready to blow this? Let's get outta here...! 

Harry ignores him. He won't accept defeat. 

Harry Chick, get your butt over here. 

Chick drags his ass over to Harry. 

Chick Yeah. 

Harry We're gonna fix this - make it work. If we weld those two 
together and  go in one speed.... 

Chick Harry.... 

Harry Get your ass up here! 

Chick doesn't move. The two men stare at each other. 

Chick I've been with you fourteen years. I've never said this to 
you, never  thought I would. It's over. 

Chick walks off toward the shuttle. Bear joins him. 

Harry, atop of the Armadillo, looks around. His head drops...he's 
burning up.  His fist clenches the HALF MEDALLION in his hand 
(where is it - clipped to suit  - in pouch of suit?)
 His eyes shut tightly. He is going to will victory from  defeat. 
He will not give up. 

CAMERA'S at low angle, giving Harry a larger-than-life look. 

Harry hears something. A LOW RUMBLE. It is confusing. It sounds 
like......an  ARMADILLO ENGINE. 

Harry opens his eyes. He slowly turns and looks -- 

ACROSS THE VALLEY - ON THE DISTANT RIDGE - The front bumper of 
A.J.'s Armadillo  inches over the ridge crest. 

HARRY, for the first time on the asteroid, smiles. Miracles do 
happen. 

HARRY CHICK...BEAR!!! 

Chick and Bear about ready to enter the Freedom's airlock, stop 
and turn. They  see A.J.'S ARMADILLO ROARING down the hillside 
onto the drilling site. 

EXT. FREEDOM - DRILLING SITE 

A.J. and Lev roar up to the drilling site in the Independence's 
Armadillo. They  come down a hill spectacularly without brakes 
and it piles into shit, knocking  things down. 

Lev and A.J. bounce up to Chick and Bear.....hugs and high-fives 
go around. 

Bear A.J. Frost. Back from the dead. 

Chick Now you can die with us. 

Harry All the bits are gone, A.J. I've been inventing drill bits 
for  twenty-five years and I don't know what to use. 

A.J. You wouldn't happen to need a diamond tipper, would you? 

A.J. pulls out the POUCH OF DIAMONDS, found on the ridge. 

Harry Boys, we're back in business! 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Golden stares at the wall. Grace is curled up on a chair in the 
corner. 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 We have good news folks. A.J. and the Russian just showed up. No  
other survivors. 

Grace shuts her eyes, smiling. Sobbing. 

EXT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AFTERNOON 

Chick shuts off an ARC WELDER and moves aside, letting Harry view 
a DRILL BIT  with A.J.'S DIAMONDS mounted on the top like 
diamonds in a ring setting. Harry  and the guys smile. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The NEWLY CREATED DRILL BIT lowers into the drilling hole and 
begins turning. It  CHEWS into the shit down below, WHIRRING and 
RIPPING and......descends quickly. 

Chick It worked! She's goin' through her like a hot knife through 
butter! 

BEGIN MONTAGE

The men drill a shitload of feet in very little time. It is a 
feverish pace,  their teamwork perfectly timed, as if 
choreographed. 

QUICK CUTS

Harry Distance, Chick. 

Chick Eight hundred and twenty feet, Harry. 

Harry We gotta do 180 in thirty minutes. 

Chick Downhole pressure's goin' through the roof! 

Harry Stop! Shut down. 

Chick throws the lever. The drill pipe stops turning. 

A.J. Harry, we can't stop. 

Harry Got to, kid. No choice. 

A.J. Drill right through the pressure to pay dirt. 

Harry That's crazy. 

A.J. Sometimes crazy works. 

Harry and A.J. stare at each other. 

Harry Chick, A.J.'s callin' this one. 

A.J. Full throttle! 

Chick throws the lever. The DRILL PIPE descends on full throttle. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

All the TECHNICIANS stand, staring at the CENTRAL BOARD, where a 
graph shows the  drilling progress. 

Flip Nine hundred and eighty...Nine ninety...they're into the 
fault, they're  doing it. 

Golden looks at the CLOCK. THIRTY-ONE MINUTES TO GO. He twists 
his wedding ring. 



Golden Now just get the thing in the hole. 

All the TECHNICIANS stare at their monitors. The atmosphere is 
thick with  tension. Clark chews his nails. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The HOLE'S finished, the drill pipe's been pulled; A.J. drives 
the ARMADILLO  safely away from the site. 

Watts and Sharp roll a GURNEY containing the NUCLEAR DEVICE 
(a massive stainless  steel tube)
 down Freedom's cargo bay RAMP toward the hole. Harry and all the  
Roughnecks stand by the HOLE. 

Harry One thousand feet. 

Chick 
(smiles)
 Thousand and three, Harry. With a half hour to spare. 

Sharp and Watts roll the NUCLEAR DEVICE GURNEY past the 
Roughnecks up to the  drilling hole. 

Harry Get the pipe and bit outta there. 

Chick gets inside the Armadillo. Grabs the stick-shift. 
Compresses the clutch  and throws it in reverse. 

THE DRILL PIPE begins to reverse out of the hole. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Skip She's gettin' hotter! Gotta mean gas - methane, helium, 
probably water  vapor. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

The DRILL PIPE turns sloely, retracting from the hole. Bear, atop 
the drilling  platform, is working on something with a wrench. 

Bear accidently drops his wrench. It falls on the turbine's 
RIPPED MESH  PROTECTIVE SCREEN and hangs there. Bear looks at it 
nervously and reaches...THE  WRENCH falls into the turbine 
spinning at six-thousand r.p.m. With a GRINDING  SQUEAL, the 
wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and -- 

THE DRILLING ARM reverses speeds and VIOLENTLY THRUSTS THE PIPE 
FORWARD,  buckling it. A piece of the drill string is BLOWN OUT, 
smashing into Sharp's  helmet, spider-webbing his faceshield. 
He's out cold. 

Harry and the guys dive away from the hole. Chick, confused, 
works the clutch  furiously to no avail. THE DRILLING ARM RAMS 
THE PIPE back down the hole, where  it BUCKLES, BENDS AND BREAKS 
IN HALF. 

Tito tends to Sharp..his face has lost all color. Harry 
approaches the hole.  Looks down. FIFTY FEET DOWN IS A MESS OF 
MANGLED PIPE, blocking the hole. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 

Golden continues looking at the THERMAL IMAGING. 

Golden Harry, c'mon, we got thirty minutes.

 Somebody's gotta go down there. 

Chick Don't look at me. 

Bear I can't even get my foot in there. 

Harry turns and eyes A.J.    A.J. stares down the hole. 

Harry Do or die, kid. 

CLOSE ON A.J. as he peers into the hole. 

A.J. Something I've been meaning to talk to you about. When this 
is all over  and we're back home, I'd like to marry your 
daughter.... 

Harry stares at A.J., the look priceless. 

A.J. 
(cont'd)
 Maybe I'll ask her again later.... 

Harry turns around..looking up at the star-filled sky. A.J. walks 
over to  Sharp...who's coming to now. 

Harry 
(to Golden)
 Oh yeah, Golden? 

Golden 
(V.O.)
 Go ahead, Harry. 

Harry Your shuttle pilot just took a nasty shot from a drill 
string.... 

Golden Is he alright? 

Harry I hope so, he's gotta get us off this shithole. 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

A.J, tied to a SAFETY TETHER, comes down the hole with a HAND-
HELD CUTTER and a  LENGTH OF ROPE. He reaches the obstruction. 
The DRILL PIPE has been mashed,  bent, buckled. Severed ends stab 
into the sides of the hole. A.J. starts cutting  with the hand-
held cutter. 

EXT. DRILLING HOLE 

The guys stand there, watching. Nothing happens. Agonising 
seconds pass.  Suddenly the ground rumbles. Another EARTHQUAKE. 
It slowly starts to subside. 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

The hole shakes. A.J. freezes, sweating. 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 A.J., we need you. I need everything you got. 

A.J. wrestles with the severed pipes, untangling them, tying the 
ROPE to them.  He gives the rope a tug. Chick and Bear, above, 
pull up the broken pipes.

Sharp Enter interface with the weapon. 

Pitts clicks a six digit code into a DIGITAL PAD on the DEVICE'S 
REMOTE  DETONATOR. 

Pitts Device armed. 

The NUCLEAR DEVICE has a small SLED with RATCHET WHEELS to let it 
slide down the  hole slowly. Sharp and Watts lift one end of the 
gurney. THE NUCLEAR DEVICE  slides off the gurney toward the 
MOUTH OF THE DRILLING HOLE.

Skip It's a mess up there...! 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

ANOTHER TEMBLOR hits, the worst yet, 9.7 on Earth. Watts falls, 
losing her grip  on the gurney; her end collapses. THE NUCLEAR 
DEVICE lurches sideways off the  gurney and rolls away from the 
drilling hole...... 

The NUCLEAR DEVICE slides off the gurney.... 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

A.J. experiences the DEEPEST, MOST SINISTER RUMBLE YET, emanating 
form the  asteroid's core, something from hell. There's a 
horrendous WHOOSHING SOUND. 

A WINDSTORM OF PEBBLE, like a blowing tornado, whooshes up from 
the hole,  smashing into A.J.'S FACESHIELD. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Everyone whirls around in the sound's direction as -- 

ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR - A 100 FOOT METHANE GEYSER erupts, 
spewing a PLUME OF  HIDEOUS GREENISH GAS into space. Then another 
200 FEET HIGH! Another 500 FEET  HIGH! The ASTEROID has become 
alive. The geyser's eruptions loosen the  asteroid's surface 
material and -- 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

A.J. THIS SUCKS.... 

A.J. is whooshed violently out of the hole. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

PEBBLES AND HOT STEAM BLASTS from the drilling hole. Everyone 
recoils.... 

Harry Get back!! 

A.J. shoots out of the pipe, tethering the SAFETY LINE behind 
him, blowing into  space. The safety tether snaps and RIPS off. 
A.J. is 70 feet off the surface.  Harry dives for his ripped 
tether. Catching it, inches before A.J.'s thrown into  space. 

Harry and Bear grab A.J.'s safety tether and begin to pull him 
down. Chick  stares at something O.S., his jaw drops. 

Chick This thing definitely doesn't like us. 

CHUNKS OF THE ASTEROID, some as big as trucks, others as big as 
houses, dislodge  from the ASTEROID SURFACE and, slowly at first, 
but with terrifyingly increasing  speed and momentum..... 

.... they start rolling. 

HARRY AND THE GUYS just stand there, disbelieving what they're 
seeing. 

On come the ROCKS and ICE CHUNKS, rolling. As they hit smaller 
surface rocks,  they take little hops, and bigger hops, until 
they are BOUNDING across the  surface. Harry lashes A.J.'s tether 
to the Armadillo. 

Harry and the guys run for their lives. 

In the midst of this -- 

-- A 500 FOOT HIGH GEYSER erupts next to the drilling hole. Pitts 
gets blasted  by the geyser, which blows him across the asteroid 
floor, SLAMMING him into the  parked Armadillo. A BOULDER rolls 
at Pitts and squashes him against the  ARMADILLO , killing him. 

A 20 FOOT ICE BOULDER rolls toward A.J.'s SAFETY TETHER. 

A.J., suspended 70 feet off the asteroid surface, looks down at 
the ONCOMING ICE  BOULDER. A.J., terrified, tries to unbuckle the 
tether, but he can't in time. 

The boulder hits A.J.'s tether, rolling over it, flattening it to 
the asteroid  surface, which causes -- 

--A.J., with a JOLT, to be yanked toward the surface. A.J. 
scrambles with his  safety harness. 

Chick, next to the Armadillo, sees A.J.'s plight. He dives 
inside, engages the  gears. The Armadillo ROARS toward the 
oncoming ICE BOULDER. 

A.J., terrified, continues to descend as -- 

Chick, driving the Armadillo, rams the ICE BOULDER just as it's 
about to roll  over A.J. The boulder hops up, SMASHES down on the 
Armadillo's hood, CRUSHING  the steel compartment around Chick, 
and gently rolls over onto -- 

A.J., who log-rolls under the Armadillo, as the ice boulder 
WHOMPS down and  keeps rolling. 

THE NUCLEAR DEVICE is rolling across the asteroid's surface. 
Pebbles and debris  CLANGING off the device's REMOTE 
DETONATOR..... 

Harry bounds toward the Armadillo. THE LARGEST, JAGGED ROCK rolls 
at the  vehicle. Harry's caught. There's no place to turn. The 
rocks rolls straight at  him. Twenty feet....10 feet....Harry 
FALLS heavily to the ground. 

Harry gets up and dives down inside a fox-hoe-sized INDENTATION 
in the asteroid  surface.... 

The BOULDER rolls right over him. 

Finally the quake stops. The situation stabilises. Everyone gets 
to their feet.  Harry and A.J. get up. They look off at -- 

The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling away in the distance, smashing into 
other rock  formations. 

Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs 
one. Holds it  up, marvelling at it. The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling 
away in the distance,  smashing into other rock formations. 

Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs 
one. Holds it  up, marvelling at it. 

Sharp, with bruises on his face, looks through his cracked 
faceshield down at  Pitt's corpse. 

Sharp He's dead. 

Harry Put it down, Chick. 

Chick tosses down the diamond and follows Harry. Everyone checks 
themselves.  Looks at others. There's no talk, no time to lose. 
They reconvene, by the  NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's dented. The 
alumniium gurney is smashed, mangled. 

Sharp Three on that side, the rest over here. 

They hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole. 
They plug one  end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the 
other. The NUKE begins to  insert down the hole. Suddenly Sharp 
tries to grab a TUBULAR PIECE OF ALUMINIUM  from the broken 
gurney. 

Sharp 
(cont'd)
 Stop...! 

-- rams it into the wheels of the NUKE'S RATCHET-WHEEL DELIVERY 
SLED. The nuke  stops inserting into the hole. Sharp inspects the 
REMOTE DETONATOR. 

Sharp 
(cont'd)
 The remote's shot. 
(looks up)
 It'll have to be manually  detonated. 

Chick What's that mean? 

Pause. 

Harry Means one of us ain't leaving. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Golden addresses the room. 

Golden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote 
detonator is not  functional. One of the crew is going to stay 
behind and....
(deep breath)
  ...manually detonate the device. 

Golden looks over at Grace. She is stunned. The news is just 
sinking in. 

Golden Don't stay for this. 

Grace I'm not leaving. 

Temple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier. 
(to Grace)
 Your father better  be a man of his word. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CABIN 

PAN FROM HARRY...to A.J. to...to Chick....to Lev...to Bear. 
Everyone is huddled  inside the cabin. 

The SMASHED REMOTE DETONATOR, a 2000-foot spool-drum of 
ELECTRICAL WIRE and a  KNIFE sit on the table. 

Sharp 
(stoically)
 I'd trade places with any one of you. But we need two people  to 
fly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys draw. 

Sharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's 
going to draw  straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes, 
no one moves. 

Sharp Who's first? 
(no response)
 Clockwise then. 

Sharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev. 

Lev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws. 
The strand is  LONG. Lev exhales. Next... 

Chick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand. 
Pulls slowly.  LONG. He exhales. Next... 

Bear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and 
pulls quickly,  decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two 
men, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s  turn.... 

A.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts 
in his chair.  The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J. 
looks at Harry. They lock  eyes. 

Harry Your turn. 

A.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry. 

Chick 
(starts to get up)
 I can't watch this. 

Harry 
(stern, hard)
 Sit down, Chick. 

Chick sits down. Harry looks at A.J. 

Harry Draw. 

A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches 
and begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls. 
It is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his 
hand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small 
smile. 

A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the 
Earth. 

A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half 
medallion. 

A.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. It just 
ain't gonna be  on Earth. 

They slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry and 
A.J. exchange a  long look. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Watts flips switches. Suddenly the jets ignite! 

Watts Ignition! She's started! 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Skip turns to Golden excitedly. 

Skip They got Freedom goin'! 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CARGO BAY 

A.J. and Harry stand in the airlock, helmets on. Harry carries 
the two thousand  foot spool-drum of wire. The airlock opens. 
Harry and A.J. descend onto the  asteroid. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Golden looks at the CLOCK running down - ten thirty-three... Ten 
thirty-two... Ten thirty-one... 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry and A.J. approach the NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's half in, half 
out of the  drilling hole, as they left it. Harry and A.J. 
alligator-clamp the end of the  wire spool-drum onto the nuke's 
DETONATION DEVICE. 

A.J You never answered my question. 

They finish attaching the wire. 

A.J. pulls the piece of TUBULAR ALUMINIUM out of the nuke's 
ratchet wheel  delivery sled. The NUKE descends downhole, slowly 
spooling out wire from the  SPOOL DRUM. 

A.J. About Grace, Harry. 
(laughs nervously)
 I know it ain't gonna happen now,  but....if things were 
different...What would you say...? 

Harry walks back toward Freedom. A.J. follows. 

Harry I always wanted a son. And if I had....I'd want him to be 
like you. 

Harry hands him the pipe section. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 You're going to need some magic in the world. You can marry  
her, A.J. 

A.J. laughs, being told at this dire time in his life. He looks 
at Harry with a  hint of bittersweet smile. 

A.J. Mean "could have...?" 

Harry No. Go home, A.J. Marry Grace. 

A.J. I'm not going home Harry. 

With one hand, Harry stabs the airlock door, and then with a 
small pipe clamp,  rips A.J.'s air tubes off. 

Harry It's my hole, I drilled it, and I'm staying with it till 
the end. 

Harry grabs him, throws his kicking, screaming body into the 
airlock. A.J. is  choking. 

Harry 
(cont'd)
 She's always going to be my little girl. 

The door shuts automatically. Harry is now alone. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AIRLOCK 

A.J. explodes from the airlock into the cabin. 

A.J. Goddamn it, HARRY....! 

A.J. lunges for the airlock. 

Sharp grabs A.J. with his good arm, helped by Bear..holding him 
back. 

A.J. LET ME GO....LET ME GO....!! 

SHARP YOU HAVE NO OXYGEN...YOUR TUBES ARE RIPPED...LET IT 
GO....!! 

A.J., sobbing, furious, POUNDS on the AIRLOCK WINDOW, staring at 
Harry outside. 

A.J. 
(pounding on the door)
 HARRY!! 

Harry turns and walks back to the drilling hole. Sharp looks at 
him. 

Sharp This guy really is a hero.... 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL REAR ROOM 

Skip Director? It's Mr. Stamper. He wants to talk to his 
daughter. 

Golden looks over at Grace. Their eyes meet.... 

A N.A.S.A. Tech hands Grace a mike and exits. She stares at the 
static on the  monitor. Harry's face fades in and out. Grace 
knows something is very wrong from  her father's strained, tired 
face. She forces a smile. INTERCUT with Harry  inside the 
Armadillo

Grace Daddy. 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 Grace. I...
(sighs)
 This is so hard for me. I don't have.... 

Tears start to well up in her eyes. 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 
(cont'd)
 ...I just....want you to know how much I love you. 

Grace I'm so proud of you, Daddy. 

Grace wipes a tear from her face. 

Harry 
(V.O.)
 
(looking at Earth)
 It's so beautiful up here. So pure. 
(swallows  hard)
 I remember something I read once..."The world is a fine 
place...and worth  fighting for."  looks at Earth, smiles)
 Gracie, I'm just an iron-ass-warrior doin'  what's best. 
(pause)
 Take care of A.J. I'll look in on you from time to time.... 

Harry pulls off the video link. Grace's monitors go black. Grace 
touches the  monitor, as Harry's face fades away. 

Her knees buckle. She sinks to the floor. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry looks at the detonator in hand. 

Harry You have three minutes and I'm not waiting. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Watts and Sharp settle into the cockpit and begin flipping 
switches. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry, all business now, situates himself next to the nuke. The 
manual detonator  in his hand. 

Harry Let's go, Sharp. Get the hell off this rock. I WILL push 
this button. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Sharp hits the THRUSTER SWITCH. 

EXT. FREEDOM 

The booster rockets SPUTTER and die. 

INT. FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Nothing happens. He HITS it again. Again. 

Watts unbuckles and goes to the ENGINE IGNITION SYSTEM. 

The timer continues counting down to one thirty-four... One 
thirty-three... One thirty-two... 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Skip The thrusters are down! 32 seconds. 

EXT. ASRTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry looks irritably at the SHUTTLE'S SPUTTERING THRUSTER. 

Harry Sharp, you better get those engines goin'. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - SERVICE HATCH 

The timer counts 23...22...21. 

Watts is frantically adjusting the FUEL MODULATOR'S VALVES... 

Sharp Watts, we gotta get that thing going! 

Watts THE INTERIORR VALVE'S STUCK! 

Lev crowds in next to her. 

Watts 
(cont'd)
 
(to Lev)
 BACK OFF!! YOU DON'T KNOW THIS COMPONENT!! 

Lev backs off. Keeps looking at the modulator, curiously. 

IN THE COCKPIT - the Timer reads 10...9...9...SHARP keeps hitting 
the THRUSTER  SWITCH. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Golden paces. Technicians stare pessimistically at consoles. 

Golden Stamper, you gave me your word. You have five seconds. 
PRESS THE  BUTTON! 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Temple 
(V.O.)
 Sharp, I NEED A SOLUTION! 

BACK TO LEV , Watts and Sharp. 

Sharp Sir with all due respect, if I knew the PROBLEM, I'd give a 
SOLUTION,  SIR..! 

Temple Well, find a solution!! 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry is looking at the shuttle. Close-Up on finger ready to pull 
the trigger. 

Harry SHARP, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? GET THE HELL OUT OF 
HERE! 

Harry's eyes close as the clock counts -10...-11...-12. 

Temple STAMPER DETONATE! 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - SERVICE HATCH 

Lev 
(to Watts)
 WE HAVE JUST THE SAME SHIT PART IN RUSSIA!! SOMETIMES IT NOT  
WORK SO WE HIT!! YOU GOTTA GIVE IT WHACK!! WHACK!! HIT!! 

Watts WHAT!!? 

Lev GIVE IT WHACK!! 

Lev grab a wrench and goes ballistic. SMASHES it down on the 
component, AGAIN  and AGAIN and AGAIN. We hear JET FUEL COURSE 
through the component and -- 

-- SHARP hits the IGNITION SWITCH and the THRUSTERS FIRE. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

Shuttle Freedom lifts off the asteroid on full REVERSE THRUSTER 
POWER, like a  Harrier jet. It ascends backwards, falling away 
from the asteroid, away from  Earth, toward the Moon. 

Harry is a solitary figure, left behind. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

Sharp, Watts, A.J., Lev and Bear watch Harry becoming smaller and 
smaller on the  asteroid. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry takes his final breaths. Looks around. 

Harry All right, son-of-a-bitch, it's just you and me.... 

Harry's FINGER compresses on the detonator button.... 

A GEYSER OF STEAM next to the drilling hole BLAT up to five feet 
away. A SECOND  GEYSER, directly underneath Harry, BLOWS. The 
MANUAL DETONATOR flies from  Harry's hand as he's knocked 
backward -- 

-- into the drilling hole! 

INT. DRILLING HOLE 

Harry falls ass-first down the hole, his PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS 
pushing him  further and further down. Harry's FINGERS GOUGE into 
the walls of the hole. He  scissors his legs. HIS BOOTS scrape 
the sides. He begins climbing up out of the  hole....We see that 
his air has been punctured. He's losing pressure. He starts  to 
choke. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

They've ascended to a safe distance. 

Sharp Something's wrong. 

A.J. Don't worry. He'll come through. 

Sharp We should have detonation by now. 

A.J. Harry doesn't fail. 

Sharp We're going back. 

A.J. What? 

Sharp Every life, that you know, will die....unless that nuke is 
detonated. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

HARRY'S GLOVED HANDS grip the sides of the hole. Then his helmet 
appears. He  looks across the asteroid surface to the MANUAL 
DETONATOR, lying in the dirt. 

The nuke has now descended several hundred feet into the hole. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

WE MOVE DOWN the faces of the terrified men, looking down on the 
craggy  asteroid.... 

Chick 
(unsure)
 That means we might die too.... 

Sharp Watts, prepare for re-landing. NOW!! 

Watts, frozen with fear, begins hitting switches. 

EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 

Harry crawls out of the hole. 

The nuke is at the bottom of the hole. Harry runs, gasping for 
air, bounding  across the asteroid surface, dodging geysers and 
rolling debris. He dives for  the detonator. He stares long and 
hard. A TEAR wells in his eye. His finger  presses on the 
detonator...sweat pours over his face.... 

Harry I beat you. 

SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP on Harry's finger as it presses the 
detonator. 

EXT. SPACE 

The nuclear device DETONATES. A spectacular concussion. The 
ASTEROID SPLITS in  two halves, as planned, like a split diamond. 
The TWO BLOWN PIECES wing off into  space, on new vector angles 
which might miss the Earth.... 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT 

The detonation ROCKS the cabin. Everyone's violently buffeted 
around. 

Watts Houston, we have detonation! 

Watts fumbles for the reverse switches as the flames from the 
explosion grow  CLOSER....She hits the directional THRUSTERS, 
jamming it as hard as it will  go...the flames bite up at them. 
The shuttle veers off toward Earth. 

A.J. Harry.... 

A.J. and the others stare out the cockpit window as the NUCLEAR 
FISSION  EXPLOSION FLAMES OUT, the halves of the asteroid wing 
off. 

EXT. AROUND THE WORLD - MONTAGE OF IMAGES 

IN EXTREME SLOW MO, we see images around the world. WALL STREET 
deserted....a  crowded BAR with people huddled around a 
T.V....Extremely tight on a TEAR  falling form a woman's 
face....ENGLISH FARMERS in a corn field.....a FATHER  holding his 
SON as they watch the brilliant flaming sky....Golden closes his  
eyes and falls to his seat....Arms raise in unison....PEOPLE 
embrace....AT THE  PYRAMIDS, dappled in firelight, hundreds 
praying.... 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

Grace is quietly weeping. 

THE ASTEROID'S DETONATION is computer-imaged on the Central 
Board. WE SEE the  ASTEROID'S TWO HALVES, moving in new 
directions. The Technicians stare in  wonderment. 

Golden Where are they, Flip? Give me some angles, give me some 
directions,  give me speeds... 

Flip 
(analysing new data)
 The new courses are....they're gonna miss us! 

The Technicians CHEER. Grace looks up. Wipes her tears. Golden 
approaches her. 

Golden I just want to tell you I'm proud to know the daughter of 
the man who  just saved the world. 

EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE LANDING AREA 

Shuttle Freedom touches down. N.A.S.A. QUARANTINE VEHICLES race 
out to meet it. 

INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL 

N.A.S.A.TEHNICIANS sit at consoles, exhausted. There are Coke 
cans, coffee mugs,  cigarettes overflowing ashtrays. Jimbo, Theo 
and Pearl, wearing V.I.P. VISITORS  BUTTONS, stand at the back. 

Jimbo This definitely doesn't look like a glamorous job. 

INT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

A.J., Chick and Bear unbuckle, begin to rise from seats. 

Chick I'm dyin' for a Budweiser. 

Sharp Stay seated. Let the medical quarantine trucks set up. 

Bear I ain't gettin' another enema from Nurse Ratchet. 

A.J., Chick and Bear look at each other. 

A.J. What would Harry do? 

Bear I think he'd go get a beer. 

EXT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM 

The EMERGENCY HATCH DOOR BLOWS in front of surprised N.A.S.A. 
QUARANTINE  TECHNICIANS. 

EXT. ARIZONA - SHUTTLE LANDING AREA 

A.J., Chick and Bear walk away from the shuttle. All he N.A.S.A. 
QUARANTINE  MEDICS are looking for them. 

Chick What are you lookin' at? 

Bear Yeah, okay, you're right, we're the studs who just blew up 
the Death  Star. 

A wave of fans are held back by MILITARY POLICE. 

Sharp, holding his shoulder in pain, is helped across the tarmac 
by Watts. A VET  BYSTANDER comes up to Sharp and drapes an 
American flag over his shoulders. 

Temple, with a huge grin, approaches Sharp. Temple salutes Sharp. 

Among the masses, Chick catches sight of Denise. Tommy stands 
next to her,  waving a small flag, proud as can be. 

Grace runs toward A.J.; he sees her and runs to her. 

They fall into each others arms. Grace is crying. A.J. is crying. 
They kiss.  A.J. looks up at the sky. 

A.J. He's up there, Grace. And he'll never die. Will you marry 
me? I gotcha a  new rock.... 

A.J. pulls out one of the DIAMONDS from the asteroid surface, as 
big as a  doorknob, about two thousand karats. It glitters in the 
sunlight. Grace stares  at it, agog. 

As we PULL BACK and CAMERA TILTS TO THE SKIES ABOVE. 

Where Harry Stamper's soul remains.....

1	  GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MAN'S DESPERATE FACE	 1
	   This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair of
	   haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to
	   the CAMERA with urgency:
					   ASH
			   Why would you say that I am
			   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've
			   lost my mind simply because I've
			   heard the voices and seen the
			   godless things moving in the
			   woods. If anything, I think more
			   clearly now than ever before. I
			   know now that there is such a
			   thing as a living Evil. A dark
			   and shapeless thing that lives
			   not in the spaces we know, but
			   between them. In the Dark. In the
			   night. And it wants the exact same
			   thing as you and I: a chance at
			   warm life on this Earth. It
			   doesn't care that is already had
			   that chance ...once. Now listen
			   closely because there isn't much
			   time. Listen and believe, because
			   it's all true.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
2	  EXT. A LOG CABIN - NIGHT								2
	   nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
	   figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I first saw the damn thing at that
			   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
			   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
			   in human flesh and inked in human
			   blood. It contained bizarre burial
			   rites, prophesies...and
			   instruction for demon
			   resurrection. It was never meant
			   for the world of the living.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
3	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 3
	   Ash flips through the pages from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   The book awoke something dark in
			   the woods.
									   SUPERIMPOSE:
4	  BOOK OF THE DEAD - CAMERA PANNING STRANGE SCRIPT			 4
	   inscribed on the pages.  Illustrations of demonic faces with
	   white eyes.
5	  EXT. WOODS - NIGHT									 5
	   We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
	   through the woods toward the cabin.  CAMERA rips through the
	   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   It got into my hand and it went
			   bad.
6	  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
	   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   So I lopped it off at the wrist.
7	  INT. CABIN - NIGHT									 7
	   ASH severs his hand from his wrist with the chainsaw.
8	  BLOOD RED CLOUDS									   8
	   sweep past the moon.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   In order to rid myself of the foul
			   thing, I read from a passage in
			   the book that was supposed to open
			   a hole.  A hole in Time that would
			   send the Evil back. And it worked.
9	  A BANDAGED, ONE HANDED ASH							   9
	   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon.
10	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 10
	   The Time vortex is created.  Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
	   Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   ...I just didn't plan on coming
			   along.
11	 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT									 11
	   Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
	   funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
12	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   12
	   Ash is rocketing through a funnel of swirling clouds.  He is
	   swept away from us, hand over foot, through the dark void of
	   Time.
13	 ANIMATION - A TENDRIL OF SMOKE						    13
	   swirls through blackness as a chorus of women's voices build
	   to eerie crescendo, from a musical note to a SCREAM.  The smoke
	   swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a thing alive, and forms the
	   words:
					   "BRUCE CAMPBELL"
					   "Vs"
	   The smoke is wisked away, then reforms as...
					   "THE ARMY OF DARKNESS"
	   The title billows past CAMERA REVEALING...
14	 INT. TIME VORTEX									   14
	   A GRANDFATHER CLOCK
	   its hands winding backwards at an insane rate, spins angrily
	   past, revealing other debris that has been swept up into this
	   funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void we find...
15	 ASH												 15
	   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady
	   BEATING of his heart.
16	 ANGLE ON ASH FRONT SCREEN PROJECTION					   16
	   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel
	   cloud electrifies.
17	 ASH'S BODY										    17
	   RIPS at the fabric of Time.
18	 EXT. CLOUDY SKY - DAY								   18
	   All is quiet.  Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
	   a human body flashes briefly and is gone.  A moment latter, Ash
	   appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
19	 EXT. BARREN WASTELAND - DAY							  19
	   ASH falls to the dust.  His double barrelled shotgun lands
	   beside him.  The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
	   a moment later.
20	 ASH												 20
	   looks up from the dust to behold...
21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
	   in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.  They halt before
	   Ash.
22	 WARRIOR #1										    22
	   thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Hail to him who has come from the
			   sky to deliver us from the terror
			   of the Deadites!  Hail!
23	 ASH												 23
	   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
	   join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
25	 ARTHUR											   25
	   the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
	   frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
	   lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.									    26
	   The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
	   The handless stump of Ash's right arm.  The Shotgun.
27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH									   27
	   waves a shaky hand.
					   ASH
			   Take is easy now chief. I don't
			   know how I got here and I'm not
			   lookin' for any trouble.
28	 WISEMAN JOHN										  28
	   An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
			   the promised one, written of in
			   the Necronomicon.
29	 ARTHUR											   29
	   Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
	   as...
30	 ASH'S CHEST										   30
	   is cut. A thin red gash.
					   ARTHUR
			   He bleeds.  As a man bleeds.  The
			   one written of in the Book would
			   not bleed.
31	 ARTHUR GESTURES									    31
	   and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
					   ARTHUR
			   Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
			   I say to the pit with him!  If he
			   is truly the promised one... he
			   will emerge.
					   WARRIOR #2 AND #3
			   Aye!  The pit's a fair test!
					   GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
			   To the pit with the blackard!
32	 GOLD TOOTH										    32
	   charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
	   of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
	   jaw.
33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
	   He tumbles from the horse.
34	 ASH												 34
	   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
	   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
36	 ASH												 36
	   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
	   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling.
37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
	   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but
	   manages to hang on for dear life.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell they put the
			   stirrups on this thing!!??
38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
	   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN							   39
	   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.
40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR									    40
					   ARTHUR
			   LIEUTENANTS!  Fetch me the blackard.
41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN						  41
	   unsheathe their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining
	   Warriors watch for sport.
42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
	   They are gaining an Ash.
43	 ASH												 43
	   glances behind him.
44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
	   They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
45	 ASH												 45
	   whips his horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYPU!
46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
	   rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
	   WHOOSH!!!
47	 ASH												 47
	   ducks the blade.
48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
	   rides up alongside Ash's other flank.  He swings and lands the
	   flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
	   THUNK!
49	 ASH												 49
	   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
	   WHOOSH!
	   ASH looks left...
50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
	   winds up for another blow.
51	 ASH												 51
	   yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
52	 THE THREE HORSES									   52
	   running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
	   swings.
54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
	   slams the First Horseman across the face.
55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
	   is knocked from his steed.
56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
	   is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
	   end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
	   turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
	   ride at one another.
59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES			  59
	   swinging his Broadsword.
60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES						   60
	   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
	   his chainsaw arm bracket.
	   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
	   place.  CLINK!
	   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
	   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses
	   and yanks again.
61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
	   draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
	   mightily.  The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
62	 ASH												 62
	   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
	   escaping his own horse's hooves.
63	 ASH												 63
	   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
	   charges and swings his broadsword.
65	 ASH												 65
	   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings

	   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
	   Horseman as he rides past.
66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					    66
	   is knocked from his horse.
67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
	   bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
	   slams against the back of Ash's skull.
69	 ASH												 69
	   crumples.  He looks up in pain to...
70	 ARTHUR											   70
	   above him. The sun over his shoulder.
71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS								  71
	   gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
					   ARTHUR
			   Bring the prisoner!
	   The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
	   are taken from him.
					   ASH
			   No!
72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
	   secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
	   arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
					   ARTHUR
			   To the castle!
73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
	   prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
	   The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
	   to run alongside them.
74	 WISEMAN JOHN										  74
	   Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.  He
	   is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
	   blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN								  75
	   blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
76	 EXT. PARCHED LAND - DAY - A WEARY ASH					  76
	   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
	   alongside him.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   Move along now!
									   DISSOLVE TO:
77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
	   CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
	   a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
	   A drawbridge is lowered.  Arthur's warriors ride over it.

78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
	   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
	   walls.
79	 INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   79
	   SHEILA
	   a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes into frame. She
	   searches the faces of Arthur's warriors and grows concerned.
	   She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to Arthur
	   atop his horse.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Arthur!  Where is my brother?
			   Did he not ride with you?
					   ARTHUR
			   Eye.  And fought valiantly.  But
			   last night fell in battle to Duke
			   Henry's men.
	   SHEILA
	   Her face does not immediately register the grief.  She attempts
	   to step forward but stumbles.  She steadies herself against the
	   stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
	   shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash.
	   She flushes with anger and races up to him. She spits and kicks
	   at him as he's dragged along.
					   SHEILA
			   Foul thing!  A pox on your throat!
			   Thou art a Murderer!  A black
			   Murderer!
80	 VILLAGE WOMEN										 80
	   restrain her.
	   SHEILA
	   cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe her.
					   VILLAGE WOMAN #1
			   May you be consoled by their
			   suffering in the pit.
81	 THE PROCESSION, ASH AND THE FOUR OTHER PRISONERS			 81
	   halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the
	   prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at
	   swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the
	   ground. This is THE PIT.
82	 ASH												 82
	   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering
	   what they have in store for him.
83	 SHEILA											   83
	   stares at him in hatred.
84	 THE PRISONER NEXT TO ASH								84
	   eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red.
					   DUKE HENRY
			   You sir, are not one of my
			   vassals.  Who are you?
					   ASH
			   Who wants to know?
					   DUKE HENRY
			   I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale.
			   Lord of the Northlands and leader
			   of its people.
					   ASH
			   You ain't leadin' but two things
			   now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack
			   left town.
85	 A STERN FACED ARTHUR AND HIS FOUR LIEUTENANTS			    85
	   address the doomed men:
					   ARTHUR
			   There is an Evil that has awakened
			   in this land.  And whilst my
			   people fight for their very souls
			   against it, you, Duke Henry the
			   Red, wage war on us. Your people
			   are no better than the foul
			   corruption that lies in the bowels
			   of that pit!  May God have mercy
			   on your souls.
86	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S MEN									86
	   crank a massive wench.  Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid
	   slides back, revealing a dark hole.  The Pit.
87	 FROM THE BOWELS OF THE IRON GRATED PIT					 87
	   a echoed wailing rises up.
88	 ASH, HENRY AND THE OTHER PRISONERS						88
	   stiffen in fear.
89	 AN OLD WOMAN AMONGST THE JEERING CROWD					 89
					   OLD WOMAN
			   Aye. Into the pit with the
			   bloodthirsty sons of whores!
	   She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly as
	   CAMERA PANS TO...
90	 HENRY'S WARRIOR #1									 90
	   as he's thrown down into the pit.  He disappears into the
	   blackness.
91	 CAMERA PANS AND HALTS CLOSE ON ASH						91
	   watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of
	   terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom.
92	 CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PIT							 92
	   looking down into the blackness we hear:
					   HENRY'S WARRIOR #1 (O.S.)
			   I beg of you... by all that's
			   holy!  Lower a rope!  Lower... Oh,
			   for the love of god!  no!  NO!!!
			   AIIIIIiiieee!
	   The sound of ripping and scratching.  The SHRIEK of terror is
	   cut short as...
	   A GEYSER OF BLOOD
	   erupts upward from the pit. Then silence.
93	 ASH												 93
	   is frozen in fear.
					   TOWER GUARD (O.S.)
			   There!  He's escaping!
	   ASH'S TERRIFIED GAZE
	   jerks from the pit to...
94	 TRACKING SHOT - HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						94
	   making a break for it!  He's past the guards, heading for the open
	   drawbridge.
95	 THE TOWER ARCHERS									  95
	   spot him and fire arrows.
96	 ANGLE ON											 96
	   PING!  PING!
	   They bounce off the Warrior's armor.  He's makes it to the open
	   drawbridge when...
97	 ARTHUR											   97
	   pulls back a iron arrow in his crossbow.  ZING!  He lets it fly.
	   CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow...
98	 PAN HALTS ON HENRY'S WARRIOR #2						   98
	   The iron arrow punctures the Warrior's armor, pegging him to
	   a wooden post.  He dies standing.
99	 THE CROWD											99
	   Cheers.  They turn their attention to the remaining prisoners:
	   CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to the next prisoner
	   in line...
100	ASH												 100
	   turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea:
					   ASH
			   Hey, I never even saw these
			   assholes before..
	   He spins to Duke Henry the Red.
			   You gotta tell 'em you don't know
			   me. We never met. Tell him.
					   HENRY
			   I do not believe that he shall
			   listen.
101	THE WARRIORS										  101
	   grab Ash and shove him into the pit.
102	ASH												 102
	   tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul
	   water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful

	   of the rancid water. He looks about.
103	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 103
	   UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness.
104	ASH												 104
	   spins to a small sound.
105	INT. PIT - ASH'S P.O.V.								 105
	   Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water.
106	ASH												 106
	   shifts his glance again.
107	A SHADOW											 107
	   rounds a corner and disappears from sight.
108	ASH												 108
	   doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir.
	   Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes
	   break the surface.
109	ASH												 109
	   spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around,
	   he is confronted by...
	   A FEMALE EVIL DEAD
	   It's rotted corpse rockets up from the water inches from Ash's
	   face!
110	CLOSER											   110
	   Putrid water drains from it's empty eye sockets and mouth. It
	   jerks like a marionette as it advances.
111	ASH SCREAM										    111
	   and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to
	   scale the steep face. He gets one foot up.
112	THE DEADITE'S HAND									 112
	   clutches Ash's ankle and yanks him back down.
113	DOWN ANGLE ON ASH									  113
	   He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing.
114	ABOVE THE PIT - GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER VILLAGERS			   114
	   hoot and cheer for Ash to be devoured.
115	THE PIT - THE DEADITE								   115
	   grabs Ash, and begins hammering him with her rotted fists.
116	ABOVE THE PIT - SHEILA								  116
	   shouts for Ash's death.
117	THE PIT - ASH'S FACE								    117
	   The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash.
118	LONG SHOT - ASH									    118
	   is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water.
119	THE DEADITE										   119
	   races toward Ash, leaps into the air and comes down with a
	   kneedrop onto Ash's stomach.
120	ASH												 120
	   cries out in pain.
121	ASH'S LEGS										    121
	   cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He
	   flips the beast.
122	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 122
	   rides into the castle, dismounts and pushes through the crowd
	   with a bundle wrapped in cloth.
123	THE DEADITE										   123
	   grabs Ash by the throat.
124	THE PIT - A BLOODIED ASH								124
	   is thrown against the rock wall of the pit.
125	THE DEADITE										   125
	   advances.
126	ABOVE THE PIT - WISEMAN JOHN							 126
	   shouts down at Ash.
127	THE PIT - ASH										 127
	   trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts
	   backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints
	   to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an
	   object falling at him through the glare above.
128	THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION							   128
	   tumbling downward.  Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its
	   blade of steel.  Ash's Excalibur!
129	ASH - SLOW MOTION									  129
	   summons his strength and leaps upward.
130	LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP - THE CHAINSAW - SLOW MOTION		   130
	   Tumbling downward...
131	HIGH ANGLE- ASH									    131
	   ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars
	   past CAMERA.
132	LONG SHOT - SLOW MOTION								 132
	   Ash rising up through frame to meet the falling saw.
133	ASH'S STUMP										   133
	   snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK!
134	ASH WITH HIS CHAINSAW								   134
	   He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast.
					   ASH
			   Come on, you blasted piece of--
	   He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and...
	   VERRROOOOOOM!!
135	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIOR AND VILLAGERS				   135
	   gasp at the ROAR of the chainsaw.  Blue exhaust billows up from
	   the pit.
136	THE PIT - LOW ANGLE - THE DEADITE						 136
	   lunges at Ash.
137	DEADITE HAND MEETS SAW								  137
	   Buzzzzz!!
138	ASH												 138
	   is splattered with black bile.
139	THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND							   139
	   flies upward, past the face of the bewildered beast.
140	CAMERA MOUNTED TO THE HAND							   140
	   as it ascends, Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below.
141	ABOVE THE PIT - THE DEADITE'S SEVERED HAND				  141
	   flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken
	   spectator. It's fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks
	   and flails about, into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the
	   hand free from his face, tossing it back down into the pit.
142	THE PIT - ASH										 142
	   raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite
	   hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow...
143	CAMERA MOUNTED ON ASH								   143
	   Ash decapitates the beast.
144	ABOVE THE PIT - THE WARRIORS AND VILLAGERS				  144
	   stop cheering from the Deadite. They're starting to like this
	   guy's guts and style.
145	THE LAST REMNANTS									  145
	   of the beast sink beneath the murky waters of the pit.
146	ASH												 146
	   climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges
	   from the earthen wall before him.
147	ASH												 147
	   slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it
	   back into the water.
148	ABOVE THE PIT - THE VILLAGERS							148
	   gasp as...
	   THUMP!
149	ASH'S CHAINSAW ARM									 149
	   comes up, over the edge of the pit.  Followed by... THUMP!  Ash's
	   bloody hand.  Then his bruised face.  Covered in the black blood
	   of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.
	   Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.
					   ASH
			   All right now. Who wants to be
			   next?  Who wants some.
150	GOLD TOOTH										    150
	   look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves him.
					   ASH
			   You want some more?  Huh?!
	   Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out
	   to Henry.
					   ASH
			   Now climb on those horses and get
			   out of here.
151	HENRY AND HIS TWO WARRIORS							   151
	   quickly mount horses.
					   ARTHUR
			   Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He--
152	ASH												 152
	   slaps Henry's horse.
					   ASH
			   GIDDYUP NOW!!  HYAAAH!
153	THE STUNNED CROWD									  153
	   parts allowing...
154	HENRY AND HIS WARRIORS								  154
	   to gallop off toward the open drawbridge and freedom.
155	ARTHUR											   155
	   stares at Ash with hatred.
					   ARTHUR
			   For that, I shall see you dead.
156	ASH												 156
	   removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and
	   turns to Arthur, then the crowd.
					   ASH
			   This is my boomstick. It's a
			   twelve gauge, double barreled
			   Remington pump. Next one of you
			   primitives touch me...
157	ASH SPINS,										    157
	   pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has
	   spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit
	   on the forgotten chain.
	   The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving
	   the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge.
158	ANGLE ON											 158
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The second shot blows the beast into a backflip, sending it
	   summersaulting down into the pit.
159	THE SOUND OF THE GUNBLAST							    159
	   echoes off the mountains like distant thunder.
160	SHEILA, THE WISEMAN, ARTHUR AND THE CROWD				   160
	   look to Ash in reverence.

161	ASH												 161
	   twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH,
	   WHOOSH...  and holsters it.
					   ASH
			   Bring me your hoo do man.
162	EXT. BLACKBIRDS									    162
	   fly from a barren tree.
163	SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS						   163
	   It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly
	   past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing...
164	EXT. TEMPLE RUINS - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					  164
	   A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each
	   twenty feet tall.  The remains of an ancient temple.  In the
	   center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire.  As old Woman
	   stirs a cauldron atop the flames.  Nearby, Arthur converses with
	   his four Lieutenants.
165	EXT. WITHIN THE RUINS - NIGHT							165
	   CLOSE UP - ASH
	   opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner
	   has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.  He waves
	   it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet
	   on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
166	ASH AND SHEILA										166
	   sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages
	   Ash's wounds.
167	SHEILA											   167
	   is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
					   SHEILA
			   I pray thee to forgive me.  I
			   believed thee one of Henry's men.
	   She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
					   ASH
			   First you wanta kill me, now ya
			   wanna kiss me.
	   He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
					   ASH
			   Lady, just leave me alone.
					   SHEILA
			   I'm sorry m'lord. Please
			   understand... T'is a cruel time
			   for us. The Wisemen say you are
			   the promised one. Our only hope
			   against the darkness that has
			   descended on this land.
					   ASH
			   They're mistaken.
	   She stares deeply into his eyes.
					   SHEILA
			   I think not.  I feel that there
			   is reason for your being here.
			   It is no accident.
166	WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN				  167
	   approach.  They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from
	   Ash.
					   ASH
			   Well what is it?  Can you send me
			   back or not?
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Only the Necronomicon has the
			   power.  A power which we both
			   require. It contains passages that
			   can dispel the Evil from this
			   place and return you to your time.
					   ASH
			   The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's
			   the thing that got me here.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   It is in a place far from here.
			   It can only be retrieved by the
			   Promised one. Other Warriors have
			   tried.  Their widows grieve still.
			   We have waited long years for you.
			   Out only hope is the Necronomicon.
			   Thou must undertake to quest for
			   it.  Alone must thou travel to
			   a distant cemetery. There thou
			   shalt find it.
					   ASH
			   Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm
			   goin' is home.
	   A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
169	DOGS												169
	   around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
170	ASH AND SHEILA										170
	   turn to see...
171	THE OLD WOMAN										 171
	   now standing too close to the fire.  Her robes ignites.  She does
	   not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir
	   the caldron.
172	ASH												 172
	   His haw drops.  He slowly stands as...
173	THE BURNING WOMAN									  173
	   spins sharply to him.  Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL DIE!
	   Her eyes are bone white.  She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
	   Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by
	   invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal
	   snarl. With two voice at once;
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE
			   NECRONOMICON.  WE SHALL FEAST UPON
			   YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
			   MAN!
174	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									174
	   collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in
	   the dust.
175	CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA		 175
	   Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open!  A nasty grin forms
	   on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen
	   approach.
176	WISEMAN JOHN										  176
	   kneels and reaches for her.
177	ASH'S HAND										    177
	   clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
					   ASH
			   It's a trick.  Get an axe.

178	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									178
	   awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK.  In a
	   frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and
	   rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
179	PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY							    179
	   With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one
	   of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two
	   warriors beneath it.
180	A GIGANTIC STONE									   180
	   topples the next stone.
	   BOOM!
	   Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!
	   Like giant dominoes, they fall.
181	ASH												 181
	   watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...
182	ANGLE ON											 182
	   The gigantic falling stones coming right at SHEILA!
183	THE FALLING STONE'S P.O.V. - SHEILA					    183
	   She SCREAMS!
184	SHEILA'S P.O.V. - THE FALLING STONES					   184
	   coming toward CAMERA.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
185	ASH												 185
	   does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the
	   stone's deadly path.
186	ASH AND SHEILA										186
	   rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.
187	CLOSE SHOT - ASH									   187
	   rolls into frame and glances up to see...
188	THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN						   188
	   rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK!
189	WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN				 189
	   latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the
	   ground.
190	ASH												 190
	   rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
191	ANGLE ON											 191
	   The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
	   BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!
192	EXT. WITHIN THE TEMPLE RUINS - PAPER MACHE STONE			 192
	   THE POSSESSES WOMAN
	   SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH!  The multi-ton stone crushes her
	   legs to paste.  Her legs are pinned but still she battles on,
	   clutching Ash about his throat!
193	ASH												 193
	   gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of
	   the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.
194	POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION					194
	   Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an
	   impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
195	ASH												 195
	   grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the
	   monster's oversized throat.  She chokes.
196	GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS					    196
	   grab the beast and pull it off of Ash.  Arthur comes to meet
	   them.  He carries a double-bladed battle axe.
197	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									197
	   vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
					   POSSESSED WOMAN
			   The Evil lives.  Slay me and ten
			   will rise to take my place.  All
			   will die.  ALL WILL -
	   CHOP!
198	IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE								  198
	   is brought down upon her throat.  The possessed body flails and
	   spasm beneath the Warrior's grip.
199	THE HEAD											 199
	   rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet.  It's eyes pop open!
					   POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD
			   ---DIE!
200	ARTHUR											   200
	   grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness.  The
	   head sails away as the laughter receded.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Now.  Will thou quest for the
			   Necronomicon?
201	CLOSE ON ASH										  201
	   He considers.
202	INT. CASTLE - BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY				   202
	   Ash and the blacksmith step into the shop.
203	ASH												 203
	   points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor.
204	THE BLACKSMITH										204
	   pounds upon the hand armor, modifying it.
205	SHEILA											   205
	   knits a grey woolen garment as she watches Ash.
206	BLACKSMITH'S WORKSHOP - DAY							  206
	   THE BLACKSMITH
	   attaches the shock absorber spring to the iron hand.
207	ASH												 207
	   tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a
	   ratchet like device.
208	ASH												 208
	   extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring.
	   WHOOSH!  CLANG!
209	SHEILA											   209
	   gasps.
210	ASH'S SPRING-DRIVEN IRON HAND							210
	   SNAPS open with great force.
211	ANGLE ON											 211
	   WHOOSH CLANG!
	   ASH'S SPRING DRIVEN HAND
	   clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron
	   goblet.
212	CLOSE ON ASH										  212
	   He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.

									   DISSOLVE TO:
213	EXT. CASTLE TURRET - NIGHT							   213
	   ASH
	   stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with
	   apprehension.  The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears
	   behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent
	   cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around
	   her.  Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one
	   another and kiss.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
214	EXT. LANDSCAPE OF CRACKED GROUND 1500MM LENS - DAY		    214
	   Arthur's castle in the distance.  In the foreground, five men

	   on horseback appear over a ridge, thundering toward us. Their
	   long wool capes billowing up behind them in the wind.
215	CLOSER ON RIDERS - TRUCKING SHOT						  215
	   Arthur and Wiseman John ride, flanked by two of Arthur's
	   Warriors.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
	   ASH
	   He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army
	   that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.  His chainsaw
	   juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.  Ash's cape
	   billows as he rides.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
216	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									216
	   The Horsemen wind down a trail.  Suddenly the horses rear up.
	   The men gain control of the frightened steeds.
					   ASH
			   What's going on?
	   ARTHUR
	   points to...
217	THE TRAIL THAT LIES BEFORE THEM						   217
	   It disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits
	   an eerie whistling.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   This is the edge of the land ruled
			   by the Dark Spirit. This path will
			   lead you to an unholy place. A
			   cemetery. There, the Necronomicon
			   awaits.
218	ASH												 218
	   anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
219	THE TWO WARRIORS									   219
	   finish placing saddlebags of water and food onto...
	   ASH'S HORSE
	   which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves.
					   WARRIOR #1
			   Lord Arthur, he is supplied.  Now
			   I beg of you, let us leave this
			   foul place.
					   ARTHUR
			   A moment.
220	WISEMAN JOHN										  220
	   moves close to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   As thou removest the Book from
			   it's cradle, you must recite these
			   words.  Clatoo, verata, Nicto.
					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Repeat them.
					   ASH
			   Clatto Verata Nicto.
					   WISEMAN #1
			   Again.
					   ASH
			   I got it.  I got it.  I know your
			   damn words. All right?  Now you get
			   this straight: I get the book,
			   you send me back. That's the deal.
			   After that I'm history.
	   Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
221	ARTHUR AND WISEMAN JOHN								 221
	   watch as Ash disappears.
222	IN A SEA OF MIST									   222
	   The sound of THUNDEROUS HOOFS.  A form materializes out of the
	   fog:  It is Ash.
223	CLOSER ON ASH										 223
	   He whips the horse.
					   ASH
			   HAAAAAA!
224	ANGLE ON ASH										  224
	   He gallops past.  CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick
	   fog.
									   FADE OUT.
225	EXT. TRAIL'S ENTRANCE TO WOODS						    225
	   ASH
	   rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail
	   leading into a thick forest.
226	EXT. WOODS										    226
	   LONG SHOT - ASH
	   rides slowly on through the darkening woods.
227	CLOSER ON ASH										 227
	   He hears a sound and look to...
228	A SECTION OF WOODS									 228
	   A branch SCRAPING against the bark of a tree.
229	ASH												 229
	   hears a woman's soft laughter.  He glance to...
230	A BUBBLING BROOK									   230
	   and nothing more.
231	THE EVIL FORCE P.O.V.								   231
	   powers through the woods toward Ash.
232	ASH												 232
	   kick his steed and bolts.
233	THE EVIL FORCE										233
	   sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity.
234	ASH												 234
	   frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which
	   jut from the ground.
235	THE EVIL FORCE										235
	   rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks.  It
	   burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash.
236	ASH												 236
	   jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He
	   gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third,
	   he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.  He falls hard to
	   the mud as the horse gallops off.
	   He groggily stands and stumbles onward.
237	THE EVIL FORCE										237
	   follows Ash down a wooded trail.
238	ASH												 238
	   running for...
239	EXT. WOODEN SHED									   239
	   a grain storage house in the clearing ahead.
240	ASH												 240
	   comes upon the shed's door.  Locked.  He heaves his body against
	   it but it won't give.
241	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						241
	   A log, that serves as the door's bolt, holds fast.
242	THE EVIL FORCE										242
	   emerges from over the ridge.
243	ASH												 243
	   unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.  He slings the chainsaw
	   from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.  Click.
	   He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT
	   that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.  He thrusts out his
	   arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!
244	INT. SHED - CLOSE ON INTERIOR DOOR						244
	   The blade bites into the log that bolts the door.
245	THE EVIL FORCE										245
	   draws closer.
246	INT. SHED											246
	   CLOSE ON CHAINSAW BLADE
	   halfway through the log.  Sawdust flies.
247	EXT. SHED											247
					   ASH
			   Come on!  Come on!
	   The chainsaw dies. He jerks out his arm to restart it. Putt.
	   Putt.
					   ASH
			   Blasted piece of junk!
248	THE EVIL FORCE										248
	   draws closer.
249	ASH												 249
	   delivers a mighty kick to the door.
250	INT. SHED											250
	   ANGLE ON DOOR
	   The partially cut log gives way.  Ash tumbles into the storage
	   shed. He slams the door shut and slides the remainder of the
	   log across the latch, re-bolting it.
251	THE EVIL FORCE										251
	   Hammers at the door of the Shed.
	   BANG!
252	INT. SHED											252
	   A terrified Ash braces his back against the door.
	   BANG!
	   Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of the door shudder
	   behind Ash.
253	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  253
	   It cracks.
254	ASH												 254
	   presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying
	   that whatever it out there, won't get in.
	   BANG!  Splinters fly.
255	CLOSE ON LOG BOLT									  255
	   BOOM!  The crack widens.
256	THE DOOR FRAME										256
	   behind Ash begins to buckle beneath the hammering blows.
257	ASH												 257
	   begins to SCREAM.  And the BANGING halts.
258	LONG SHOT - INT. SHED								   258
	   All is quiet.  Ash hugs the door. Shaking in the silence.  And
	   that's when it hits.  LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE!
	   Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
	   the Shed as the Evil Force brings it's tremendous power to bare.
259	INT. SHED - SAM-O-CAM - INTERVOLOMETER					 259
	   TRACKING WITH ASH AND THE DOOR
	   as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil
	   Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the
	   Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors,
	   taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors
	   as he flies through the air.
260	EXT. SHED - SIDE SHOT								   260
	   The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams
	   flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal
	   wave.
261	EXT. REAR DOOR OF SHED								  261
	   It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the
	   other doors.  The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to
	   the ground in a stack.
262	THE EVIL FORCE										262
	   with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods.
263	EXT. SHED- DUSK									    263
	   LOOKING DOWN UPON - THE STACKS OF DOORS.
	   All is quiet.  We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob
	   turns slightly.  The door swings upward and opens... revealing
	   a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self
	   up.

	   He beholds...
264	EXT. ABANDONED MILL									264
	   An empty place of stone and wood.  Driven by the wind, the
	   Mill's giant grinding wheel slowly turns with a squeak.
265	INT. MILL											265
	   ASH
	   enters the Mill.
					   ASH
			   Anybody here?!
	   The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his
	   breath.
					   ASH
			   This place'll do for the night.
			   Get the book in the morning.
266	INT. MILL - THREE SHOTS - INTERVOLOMETER				    266
	   Shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls.
267	ASH												 267
	   peers through the window.
268	EXT. MILL - LONG SHOT THE SUN - DAY					    268
	   a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill.  The wind
	   kicks up.
269	INT. MILL											269
	   ASH
	   listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force
	   of the gale.
270	THE WOODEN SHUTTERS									270
	   on the window quietly KNOCK.  Ash shivers and rubs his arms for
	   warmth.
					   ASH
			   Damn this cold.
271	ASH												 271
	   looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove.
272	GASOLINE											 272
	   pours out of Ash's chainsaw over some logs in the stove's belly.
273	ASH												 273
	   lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the
	   flame for warmth.
					   ASH
			   'least I won't freeze to death.
	   He turns to a tiny sound.
274	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    274
	   behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps
	   past.

275	ASH												 275
	   spins, raises his shotgun and fires.
	   BLAMITY-BLAM!
	   The window is ripped away in a shower of glass.
276	ASH'S P.O.V. - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW				    276
	   Only the night woods.  The "gnarled hand" comes back, sweeping
	   down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just
	   a tree branch swaying in the wind.
277	ASH												 277
	   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a
	   crack.
278	ASH'S EYEBALL										 278
	   through the crack in the door.
279	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE WOODS BEYOND						   279
	   CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.  There is
	   movement.
280	LONG SHOT - EXT. MILL								   280
	   The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
	   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
	   breaking.
282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE								   282
	   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
	   Ash.
283	A STARTLED ASH										283
	   leaps aside just in time.
284	ASH												 284
	   snags the horse's reigns.
					   ASH
			   Easy, boy.
	   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
	   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
285	ASH'S P.O.V.  THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR				  285
	   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
286	EXT. MILL											286
	   ASH
	   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the
	   Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
287	INT. MILL											287
	   ASH
	   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's
	   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks
	   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
	   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO....
288	THE SHATTERED MIRROR PIECES							  288
	   Each piece of mirror reflects an image of Ash.  From the eight
	   pieces of mirror spring...
289	EIGHT TINY ASHES									   289
	   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror
	   fragments and land on the floor.
290	ASH												 290
	   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire.
291	TINY ASH #1, #2, AND #3								 291
	   grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they
	   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks.
292	ASH												 292
	   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the
	   stove pipe.
293	TINY ASH #4, #5, AND #6								 293
	   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another
	   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM!
294	ASH												 294
	   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head
	   off.
295	THE TINY ASHES										295
	   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the
	   shotgun and scurry off across the floor.
296	ASH												 296
	   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it.
297	TINY ASH #1										   297
	   is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry
	   him.
298	TRACKING SHOT - THE FORK								298
	   a giant projectile as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it
	   WHOOSHES past.
	   FA-THONG!
299	THE FORK											 299
	   skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden wall of the mill.
300	ASH												 300
	   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front
	   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe.
	   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot
	   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula.
301	A BUCKET OF GREASE									 301
	   is pushed off a high shelf.
	   CLANG!
302	IT LANDS ON ASH'S HEAD								  302
	   and spills slippery grease about the floor.
303	ASH												 303
	   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back
	   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the
	   bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
	   path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting
	   needles jutting from it.
304	BUCKET-HEADED ASH									  304
	   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the
	   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks
	   the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little
	   imps.
305	TINY ASH #2										   305
	   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT...
306	ASH												 306
	   has seen him.  He "accidentally" elbows the log and Tiny Ash
	   #2 into the stove's fire.
					   ASH
			   Ooops.
307	TINY ASH #2										   307
	   is burned alive.
308	ASH												 308
	   glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet.
309	TINY ASH #3										   309
	   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic
	   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises
	   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot.
	   RIP!!
310	THE NAIL RIPS										 310
	   through Ash's shoe.
311	ASH												 311
	   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place
	   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area
	   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in
	   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost
	   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls,
	   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.
312	ASH												 312
	   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with
	   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table...
313	TINY ASHES #4 AND #5								    313
	   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs.
314	TINY ASH #7 AND #8									 314
	   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his
	   nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for
	   air.  As he inhales...
315	SUSPENDED TINY ASH #6								   315
	   is released.
316	TINY ASH #6 - SLOW MOTION - WIND FAN					   316
	   He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form
	   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat.
317	ASH												 317
	   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks
	   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his
	   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no
	   avail.
	   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are
	   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles
	   to a chair.  He goes pale.
					   ASH
			   Nasty little thing's inside me.
	   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain.
			   Well let's see how you like a
			   little hot water!
	   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding
	   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle
	   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach
	   ASH
	   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his
	   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve.
318	CLOSE ON ASH'S ARM - STOP MOTION ANIMATION				  318
	   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down
	   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin.
319	ASH												 319
	   watches in horror as...
320	THE TINY FIGURE									    320
	   squirms down his wrist and disappears into his iron hand.  The
	   Iron hand snaps open and closes uncontrollably. The possessed
	   iron hand swings at him.
321	THE IRON HAND										 321
	   connects with an uppercut that knocks Ash out of frame.
322	ASH												 322
	   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But
	   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head.
	   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into
	   the opened vice.
323	THE EVIL IRON HAND									 323
	   cranks the vice's handle.
324	THE VICE											 324
	   tightens around Ash's head.  Trapped, he looks to...
325	THE EVIL HAND										 325
	   rummaging through a wooden toolbox.  It comes upon a crude wooden
	   punch.
326	ANGLE - THE EVIL HAND - UNDERCRANKED					   326
	   stabs rapidly at Ash's good hand.  But Ash expertly dodges each
	   stab with an opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb
	   is super fast motion.
327	ASH												 327
	   with is head still wedged in the vice.
					   ASH
			   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!!
328	A PAIR OF IRON PLIERS								   328
	   has entered frame and clamps down upon Ash's nose.  He emits
	   a nasal SCREAM and shakes the pliers loose.
					   ASH
			   Soon as I get out of this thing
			   I... YIEEEE!!
	   THE PAIR OF IRON PLIERS
	   dip into Ash's mouth and clamps down upon a back molar.
					   ASH
			   No!  Not the teeth!
	   YANK!
329	THE EVIL HAND										 329
	   jerks his rear MOLAR from his head and holds up the tooth for
	   his inspection.  It sets the tooth down nearly in front of him.
	   The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth to dust.  It
	   scurries from view.
330	ASH'S HEAD										    330
	   struggling in the grip of the vice.
					   ASH
			   Where the hell are ya!?
331	THE EVIL HAND										 331
	   grabs a red hot fireplace poker from the fire.
					   ASH
			   I can't see ya!!
	   HIS EVIL HAND
	   raises a red hot fireplace poker and presses it against the
	   right half of his body.
					   ASH
			   No, no--not the poke--
	   SSSSsssssssss!
332	ASH												 332
	   jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up
	   his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His
	   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches
	   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE
	   BLINKS A THIRD EYEBALL!!!
333	THE CAMERA RACES INTO THIS HIDEOUS SIGHT				    333
	   It is the eyeball of EVIL ASH.  Beneath it, a mouth and nose
	   begin to take shape on the surface of Ash's back.
334	ASH												 334
	   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA
	   follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark
	   woods.
335	EXT. WOODS - 12MM LENSE - NIGHT						   335
	   ASH
	   staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the

	   brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this
	   protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, it's growing bigger!
336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
	   It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
	   his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
	   incarnate.
	   He is now a man with two heads!
337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
	   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
	   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
338	THE BAD ASH HEAD									   338
	   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD									  339
	   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
	   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we
	   see a terrifying sight:
341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
	   sprout from Ash's body!
342	A LEG											    342
	   rips out of his stomach.  Another foot POPS out from his back.
343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
	   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
	   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands
	   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
	   He literally splits into two.
344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
	   When it's over, there are two ASHES.
	   GOOD ASH and...
345	BAD ASH.											 345
	   They square off beneath the moonlight.
346	HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES							   346
	   circle one another like wolves.
					   GOOD ASH
			   What... are you?  Are you me?
					   BAD ASH
			   WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You
			   sound like a jerk!
					   GOOD ASH
			   Why are you doing this?!
					   BAD ASH
			   Wanna know?  'cause the answers
			   easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,
			   and yer...
347	EVIL ASH											 347
	   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face
	   as he sings:
					   EVIL ASH
			   ...Little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little goody two-
	   SMACK!
			   ...shoes, little good--
348	EVIL ASH											 348
	   the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing
	   at his nose.
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet.
349	WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN						   349
	   blown backwards into a double backflip.
350	EVIL ASH'S BODY									    350
	   slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,
	   quite dead.
351	GOOD ASH											 351
	   clutching the smoldering shotgun.
					   GOOD ASH
			   Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the
			   gun.
352	LONG SHOT - ASH									    352
	   staring down at the body of his evil self.
					   ASH
			   I know better than to bury you
			   whole.
353	EXT. MILL WHEEL - LONG SHOT - NIGHT					    353
	   The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes
	   of lightning.  The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body
	   of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill.
	   The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
	   WHOOSSH-WHOOSH!
354	MONTAGE SEQUENCE:									  354
	   Ash's hand light a torch.
355	FRIGHTENED BATS FLY									355
	   from the base of the windmill.
356	CHAINS ARE PULLED TIGHT								 356
	   across the body of Evil Ash to secure it.
	   CLICK. SNAP. CLINK.
357	THE CHAINSAW										  357
	   is switched on.  It spews a plume of blue exhaust.
358	ASH												 358
	   falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil
	   twin.  He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly
	   task.
359	EXT. NIGHT SKY - BLOOD RED CLOUDS						 359
	   float past the moon.  We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw.
360	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT								  360
	   ASH
	   with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.
	   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of
	   an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
	   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
	   as he digs a grave.
					   ASH
			   Now you see what's what.  Man's
			   body is his own personal property.
			   Don't anybody try to take that
			   away from him.
361	ASH												 361
	   finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves
	   the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.
362	INT. GRAVE - THE EVIL ASH HEAD						    362
	   It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It
	   croaks;
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   You'll never get that Book. I will
			   come back for you.
					   ASH
			   Hey, what's that you got on your
			   face?
					   EVIL ASH HEAD
			   Huh?
363	CLOSE SHOT - THE EVIL DEAD							   363
	   It's eyes dart, looking for something on it's face when a
	   shovelful of dirt is heaped atop it.
364	EVIL ASH HEAD - P.O.V. - EYEMO						    364
	   as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA.
365	ASH												 365
	   buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his
	   head;
					   ASH
				   (muttering under his
				    breath)
			   Rest in pieces.
366	ASH												 366
	   backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the
	   grave. A flash of lightning reveals...
367	THE GRAVEYARD										 367
	   in the distance. A burial place of evil. The old mill wheel
	   GROANS in the gale.
					   ASH
			   This must be it. The cemetery.
368	ASH												 368
	   moves toward the cemetery.
369	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE CEMETERY							  369
	   In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone.
370	ASH												 370
	   draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him.
	   He glances down to...
371	ASH'S P.O.V. - TRACKING SHOT - SKULL					   371
	   sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye
	   sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw
	   bone drops open with a squeak.
372	CLOSE ON ASH										  372
	   His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to...
373	THE MASSIVE BLACK STONE IN THE CEMETERY'S CENTER			 373
	   backlit by the rising moon, creates eerie beams of light and
	   shadow.
374	ASH												 374
	   arrives at the foot of the massive stone.
375	UNDERCRANKED - THE STONE								375
	   Atop it sits... THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.
376	CAMERA PANS REVEALING...								376
	   A SECOND BOOK OF THE DEAD!
377	CAMERA PANS AGAIN REVEALING...						    377
	   A THIRD!
378	CAMERA RACES BACK AT SUPER SPEED TO REVEAL:				 378
	   THREE BOOK OF THE DEAD!!!
379	A BAFFLED ASH										 379
	   steps close.
					   ASH
			   Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said
			   anything about that. Ha!  That
			   Wiseman was so busy fillin' me
			   fulla his secret words and phrases
			   and, and, his... bullshit, he
			   forgot to mention anything about
			   that.  Like do I take all of 'em
			   of one or 'em, or what?  Well...
	   He reaches for the first book and opens it.
380	ANGLE ON											 380
	   WHOOOOOOSH!!!
	   To reveal a black hole.  SCREAMS ERUPT from the dark abyss of
	   the Book. It begins to suck things into it.
381	CLOSE ON BOOK OF THE DEAD - BACKWARDS MOTION				381
	   dead leaves and mist are sucked into the book.
382	ASH - MAKE-UP APPLIANCE								 382
	   Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing
	   stronger.
383	ASH'S HAND - PUPPET									383
	   is stretched as it's pulled down into the book.
384	LONG SHOT - ASH PUPPET								  384
	   Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page.
385	ASH'S PUPPET HEAD									  385
	   stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book.
386	ASH PUPPET										    386
	   A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of
	   the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut.
387	INTERVOLOMETER SHOT - ASH							    387
	   His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to
	   normal.
					  ASH
			   Woah.  Wrong book.
	   He turns to study...
388	THE TWO REMAINING BOOKS								 388
	   ASH
	   tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it
	   is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses
	   the other.
389	THE BOOK											 389
	   moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.
					   ASH
			   Huh.
	   Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him!
390	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - PUPPET							390
	   Rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the Book.  The Book
	   flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA
	   like a bat!
391	BATBOOK P.O.V. - CAMERA RIG - UNDERCRANKED				  391
	   Swooping erratically around Ash's head.
392	THE BATBOOK										   392
	   shrieking, chases Ash around, pecking at his neck.
					   ASH
			   Dear God, help me... ahhh!!!
	   The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!
393	ASH												 393
	   pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's
	   pedestal.
394	ASH												 394
	   faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind
	   kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over.
395	CLOSE ON BOOK										 395
	   It's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face!  Two empty
	   eye sockets stare out from it.  This is the Book of the Dead...
396	ASH												 396
	   bristles in fear.
					   ASH
			   Okay.   The words.  Say the words.
			   KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh...
			   Necta... uh... Nectar...
			   Necktie... uh...
	   He hesitates, then calls out boldly.
					   ASH
			   KLATOO... VERATA...
			   NECTtphhhhhhhhhh...
	   He deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember.
	   The wind stops.  It seems to have worked.  He looks about with
	   growing confidence.
					   ASH
			   Okay then.
	   But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the
	   soundtrack.
397	LONG SHOT - CEMETARY								    397
	   ASH
	   A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by
	   one are thrust from the earth.
					   ASH
			   Hey, wait a minute. Everything's
			   cool!  I said the words!  I did!
398	EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT									398
	   A violent storm in the distance.  Lightning flashes.
399	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							399
	   A DOOR
	   blows open revealing Wiseman John.  He looks at the gathering
	   storm with foreboding.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Something is amiss.
400	HORSES IN THE CASTLE GROUNDS							 400
	   WHINNIE in hear. Sheila steps into frame and stare fearfully
	   out at the storm.
401	EXT. CEMETARY - NIGHT								   401
	   ASH runs for his horse, clutching the Necronomicon.
402	A BONEY HAND										  402
	   rips up from a grave and grabs his leg!
403	ASH												 403
	   falls.
404	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD								    404
	   is knocked from Ash's hand.
405	ASH												 405
	   reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground
	   and clutches his face.
406	THE FIRST SKELETON HAND								 406
	   digs into Ash's mouth.  It jerks his face sideways to show
	   him...
407	A GROUP OF SIX ROTTED ARMS							   407
	   that rip from the ground!
408	THE SKELETAL HANDS									 408
	   toss Ash to...
409	THE ROTTED ARMS									    409
	   grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock.  Two of the six arms try
	   to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved
	   at him.  Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his
	   face toward the skeleton hands.
410	THE SKELETON HANDS									 410
	   curl boney fingers, clenching them into fists.
					   ASH
			   No.. no more...
	   The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
					   ASH
			   Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU!
411	THE SKELETAL FINGERS								    411
	   last out and snag Ash's tongue between their boney pincers,
	   shutting Ash up.  With his tongue held, he tries to speak again,
	   but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up.  Both
	   hands work double-time at slapping him.
412	UNDERCRANKED - ASH									  412
	   His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They
	   pull his ears and gouge his eyes.
413	ASH												 413
	   open his mouth wide with in a SCREAM!
414	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETON ARM					   414
	   The boney fist is thrust into Ash's screaming mouth up to the

	   They bulge as he swallow the arm.

	   A ROTTED ARM
	   rips through the ground, punching Ash in the stomach.
417	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETAL ARM					   417
	   ASH
	   jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to
	   the ground.
418	THE ARMS											 418
	   reach for him, but he is too fast.  He stamps on one of the
	   skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.
					   ASH
				   (in a snarl)
			   Keep you damn filthy bones outta
			   my mouth.
	   SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea
	   of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the
	   Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over
	   another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
419	ASH CLIMBS										    419
	   atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...
420	EXT. CEMETARY - OLD OAK TREE							 420
	   The burial site of Evil Ash. A bolt of lightning strikes the
	   grave marker.
421	EVIL ASH'S BURIAL MARKER								421
	   is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the

	   fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided,
	   decayed version of EVIL ASH!

	   Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.
					   ASH
			   I'm through bein' their garbage

	   He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.
			   Now they owe me.  Like in the
			   deal.  I want back.
	   He whips his horse...
			   HA!  GIIDDUP NOW!!
	   ...and rides off into the darkness.

433	ASH												 433
	   pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you bring the Necronomicon!
434	ASH												 434
	   slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the
	   Wiseman.
					   ASH
			   Yes. It's just that...
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Just what?!
					   ASH
			   Nothing. Here
	   Ash produces the Necronomicon.
			   Now send be back. Like in the
			   deal.
435	WISEMAN JOHN										  435
	   takes the book and suddenly goes pale.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   No...I sensed something had gone
			   awry. The book's power. It's gone.
436	THE CROWD											436
	   murmurs at this bad news.
437	ASH												 437
	   suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   When you removed the Necronomicon
			   from it's cradle, did you speak
			   the words?
					   ASH
			   Yeah.  basically.

					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Did you speak the exact words?!
					   ASH
			   Well, maybe not every single
			   syllable, no.  But basically I
			   said them.  Yes.
438	WISEMAN JOHN										  439
	   bows his head, stung by this information.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   Dung eating fool!  Thou hast doomed
			   us. When thou misspoke the words
			   the Army of the Dead was awoke.
					   ASH
			   Hey. We had a deal. You told me,
			   you could clean this thing up,
			   once I got you the book. You said
			   there was a passage in there that
			   could get rid of this thing and
			   send me back.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The passage is useless to us as
			   long as these evil dead walk. They
			   have a terrible desire for this
			   book. And they shall come here
			   to get it. Once in their
			   possession, the Evil shall rule
			   the Earth for one thousand
			   years...Because of you...we are
			   doomed.
					   ASH
			   You wanted the damn book. You got
			   yer book. I did my part of the
			   deal.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   We did strike a bargain. I will
			   return you to your own time as
			   promised.
					   ASH
			   Yeah. Well good. That was the
			   deal.  So uh...when do you think
			   we can...
439	ASH												 439
	   looks about at the condemned faces.
440	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE VILLAGERS							 440
	   CAMERA PANS past the doomed faces in the crowd.
					   ASH
			   I mean...when can you send me...
441	ASH												 441
	   sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed with the guilt that he's
	   doomed her.
					   ARTHUR
			   The Wisemen were fools to believe
			   that you were the Promised one.
			   That one such as you could have
			   saved us!.
442	ASH												 442
	   is solemn.
443	ARTHUR											   443
	   and the others turn away in contempt.
444	SHEILA											   444
	   moves closer.
					   SHEILA
			   I still believe that thou wilt
			   help us.
					   ASH
			   No.. They're right.  I screwed
			   up. I didn't come through for you,
			   and...  I'm sorry for it.
					   SHEILA
			   I still have faith in thee. In
			   my heart I know thou wilt still
			   succeed.
					   ASH
			   Sheila... It's over for me. I
			   don't belong here and I'm going
			   home. I didn't have what it took.
			   It's over.
	   He bows his head and moves off.
	   A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!
445	ALL HEADS											445
	   look to the sky.
446	TWO WINGED DEADITES									446
	   possessed women with bat-like wings, swoop down.
447	TEN VILLAGERS										 447
	   scream as they flee from the winged beasts.
448	WINGED DEADITE #1									  448
	   Like a delta winged F-15, it banks towards Sheila.
					   ASH
			   No!
449	ASH												 449
	   races to intercept.  He plants himself between Sheila and the
	   beast.
450	WINGED DEADITE #1 - POV								 450
	   As it swoops at Ash.
451	ASH												 451
	   opens his steel hand, then clamps it closed again on the handle
	   of his sword.
452	ASKEW ANGLE										   452
	   The immense shadow of the broad winged Deadite falls over Ash.
453	ASH												 453
	   swings his sword upward.
454	CLOSE SHOT - THE BLADE								  454
	   severs the tip of the Beast's rotted wing.
455	THE FLYING DEADITE									 455
	   shrieks in pain as it soars over Ash. No longer aerodynamically
	   sound, it crashes to the ground.
456	A GROUP OF WARRIORS									456
	   fire their arrows into the beast, pegging it to a tree.  The
	   bone white eyes of the creature darken.
457	ASH AND ARTHUR										457
	   spin to the sound of a woman's SCREAM.
458	SHEILA											   458
	   in the clutches of WINGED DEADITE #2.
					   SHEILA
			   M'Lord Ash!  Help me!
	   The beast flies off with the fair maiden, soaring over the
	   castle wall and into the distance.
459	ASH												 459
	   shakes his fist at the receding beast.
					   ASH
			   Damn you!
460	THREE MOUNTED SCOUTS								    460
	   come riding in through the castle doors.
					   SCOUT
			   An army of the dead!  They have
			   gathered in the wilderness and
			   come this way.
					   ARTHUR
			   How far from here?
					   SCOUT
			   But two days ride.
					   ARTHUR
			   Then these winged ones are only
			   the first of them.
					   WISEMAN
			   Perhaps we should go from this
			   place while we can.
					   GOLD TOOTH
			   We could be safe in the mountains.
					   WARRIORS
			   Yes!  To the mountains!  We must flee!
			   They'll take our souls!
461	ANGLE ON											 461
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   All eyes look to...
462	ASH												 462
	   who stands on a high castle wall, clutching his smoldering
	   shotgun.
					   ASH
			   Go ahead and run.  Run home and
			   cry to mama.  I'm through runnin'.
			   I stay we stay and fight.
463	ARTHUR											   463
	   takes a challenging step forward.
					   ARTHUR
			   How will we stop an army of the
			   dead at out castle walls?  How will
			   you fight that?!  With more words?
			   Most of out people have already
			   fled.  We are but forty men.
					   ASH
			   We'll get Henry the Red and his
			   men to fight with us.
					   ARTHUR
			   We shall not stand in battle,
			   alongside the likes of him. Our
			   honor will not allow it.
					   ASH
			   Then you'll die.  Honor and all.
			   Now who's with me?
464	THE CROWD											464
	   is silent as they consider Ash's words. Then from the rear, the
	   Village Blacksmith steps forward.
					   BLACKSMITH
			   I'll stand by you.
465	A WARRIOR											465
	   steps forward. Then another.
					   WARRIOR #7
			   You may count on my steel.
					   WARRIOR #8
			   And mine!
466	THE CROWD											466
	   steps forward vowing their allegiance to the cause.
467	ARTHUR											   467
	   reluctantly joins them.
468	EXT. GRAVEYARD - STOP MOTION ANIMATION - NIGHT			   468
	   EVIL ASH
	   directs teams of skeletons to dig at the graves.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Dig!  Dig faster!  I want every black
			   hearted, worm infested, son of
			   a bitch that ever died in battle!
			   We'll storm their castle and take
			   the book!  Then my lads, eternal
			   life shall by ours!
469	STOP MOTION ANIMATION - THREE SKELETONS					469
	   hoist up a stone casket from the ground and with rusted swords
	   pry it open, releasing another skeleton who stands to join their
	   ranks.
470	TWO ARMORED SKELETONS								   470
	   push a bruised Sheila to her knees before Evil Ash.
471	CLOSE ON SHEILA									    471
	   looking up to Evil Ash in fear. His boney finger comes down into
	   frame and strokes her lovely cheek.  She pulls away in
	   revulsion.
472	EVIL ASH											 472
	   looks down at her with lust.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Why ain't you a sweet little
			   thing?
	   His boney digit caresses her lips.
					   SHEILA
			   Don't touch me!  You foul thing!
					   EVIL ASH
			   Your gonna learn to live me missy.
					   SHEILA
			   The Promised one will come for
			   you.
	   SKELETAL EVIL ASH

	   yanks her to her feet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Darlin' I'm gonna save him the
			   trouble.
	   He clutches her squirming body in a boney embrace.
473	EXT. GRAVEYARD - LONG SHOT							   473
	   Silhouetted by the large full moon, Evil Ash forces his kiss
	   upon Sheila.  Around them, the skeletons sharpen their swords
	   on tombstones.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
474	EXT. VAST VISTA OF BARREN LAND - DAY					   474
	   Ash rides toward the castle of Henry the Red that can be seen
	   in the distance.
475	WIDE SHOT - ASH									    475
	   is suddenly intercepted by FOUR OF HENRY'S HORSEMEN.  They
	   surround him.
					   HENRY WARRIOR #1
			   He wears the insignia of Arthur!
					   HENRY WARRIOR #2
			   Slay him!
	   The draw their swords when...
476	HENRY THE RED										 476
	   rides up between his warriors and Ash.
					   HENRY
			   Stay your arms!
	   Henry turns to Ash.
					   HENRY
			   T'is the stranger who spared me
			   from the pit. What brings you?
					   ASH
			   The Army of the Dead.
					   HENRY
			   What of them?
					   ASH
			   They're headed towards Arthur's
			   castle. We need your help. Fight
			   with us.
					   HENRY
			   So you are a vassal of Arthur now?
			   You have taken up sides with him
			   against me.
					   ASH
			   The only side I'm takin' is the
			   one that's gonna stop those
			   things.
	   Henry laughs.
					   HENRY
			   Why should I endanger my people
			   to save my enemy?
					   ASH
			   Because after they finish with
			   Arthur they'll come after you.
			   Together, we've got a chance.
			   Besides, you owe me.
477	EXT. A CRAGGY MOUNTAIN TOP - NIGHT						477
	   EVIL ASH AND SHEILA
	   ride side by side on skeletal steeds.  Sheila lifts her black
	   veil, revealing bone white eyes, set into a face now the texture
	   of cracked leather.  She looks with admiration to...
478	EVIL ASH											 478
	   He is general of the army of Deadites. He thrusts a rusted sword
	   into the air and shouts in a gritty voice:
					   EVIL ASH
			   Who rules?!
479	WIDE SHOT - ONE HUNDRED ARMORED SKELETONS				   479
	   raise their swords into the air with a shout.

	   look under the hood of the Delta 88, parked in the Blacksmith's
	   shop.
483	THE DELTA'S ENGINE									 483
	   is shattered.
484	ASH												 484
	   frowns.
485	ASH AND THE BLACKSMITH								  485
	   pour molten iron into a large sand mold.
486	THE SAND											 486
	   is brushed away revealing gear wheels.
487	HAMMERS											  487
	   beat upon red hot iron, fashioning helicopter like rotor blades.
488	THE BLACKSMITH'S STOVE								  488
	   is lowered into the Delta's engine compartment.
489	EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY							  489
	   ASH
	   walks along, inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who
	   stand at attention. He halts before a warrior and stares hard
	   at him. The Warrior glances towards Ash.
					   ASH
			   You eyeballin' me boy?
					   WARRIOR #9
			   No, M'Lord.
					   ASH
			   I can't hear you!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   NO, M'LORD!!
					   ASH
			   You squeekin' like a mouse!  Are

					   WARRIOR #9
			   NO, M'LORD!
					   ASH
			   Where you from, mouse?!
					   WARRIOR #9
			   I hail from the village of Perth.
					   ASH
			   Only two things come from Perth:
			   steers and queers. Which are you?
490	EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY									490
	   ASH
	   takes charcoal from a dead fire and chips of dried cow dung.
	   He mixes them with sulfur.
491	THE BLACK POWDER									   491
	   is bound up in a small satchel and affixed to an arrow.
492	GOLD TOOTH										    492
	   lights the fuse with a torch.
493	ASH												 493
	   draws back and releases the arrow. ZING!
494	THE ARROW											494
	   imbeds in a wooden post and EXPLODES. Large pieces of wood are

					   WARRIOR
			   They're coming!  The Deadites
			   approach!
498	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD								   498
	   A look of shock and fear on all the faces.  ASH comes into
	   frame.  CAMERA CRANES UP with him as he scales the ladder to
	   the lookout tower. He peers out to the darkening horizon.
499	ASH												 499
	   hears them before he sees them: The sound of clicking bones.
	   Painful moans of tortured souls, the clanging of approaching
	   armor.
500	ASH'S P.O.V. - THE HORIZON							   500
	   Fifty distant silhouettes of the Evil Dead appear on the

	   plays the drums upon a set of hollow skulls.
503	SKELETON #2										   503

	   ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill.
507	A SKELETON AND DEADITE CAPTAIN						    507

					   SKELETON CAPTAIN
			   M'Lord!  We are positioned on both

					   EVIL ASH
			   Where are they keeping my book?
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Most likely...there, in the
			   castle's keep. It would be the
			   safest place.  It is behind two
			   walls that must be taken first.
					   EVIL ASH
			   Excellent. Proceed.
508	SKELETON CAPTAIN #1									508
	   With a sweep of his arm, he waves the Army of rot.

			   Torch boy!
513	A TORCH BOY										   513
	   runs behind the archers, lighting the fuses on each of the
	   powder charges. As the last arrow is lit....
514	ARTHUR											   514
	   looks to the approaching army.
515	THE LINE OF DEADITES								    515
	   rolls their wooden barricades closer.
516	ARTHUR											   516

519	THE BURNING FUSES									  519

536	EVIL ASH											 536
	   turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him.
					   SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
			   Permission to regroup, m'Lord.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You needn't bother.
537	EVIL ASH											 537
	   slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the
	   MOUNTED DEADITE next to him.
					   EVIL ASH
			   You are now my captain. I will
			   now allow anything to stop me from
			   possessing the Necronomicon. Get
			   me into that castle.
538	THE NEW DEADITE CAPTAIN								 538
	   gulps and races forward into the ranks shouting:

			   RAM THE GATES!
539	TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SKELETONS							 539

					   ARTHUR
			   Where is Henry?!
					   ASH
			   He'll be here.
					   ARTHUR
			   I think he will not. But know
			   this.  No matter how this battle
			   fares, I was wrong to think you
			   a coward.
549	EXT. CASTLE										   549
	   The battering rams rips through the doors and the army of
	   darkness pours into the courtyard.
550	A LEGLESS SKELETON									 550
	   crawls in with a knife in its teeth.
					   ARTHUR
			   They're coming in. What now?!
551	ASH												 551
	   looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance,
	   dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling
	   the door closed behind him.
552	ARTHUR											   552
	   shocked at Ash's cowardly desertion, turns to his men and
	   shouts:
					   ARTHUR
			   Fall back!  Man the Parapet!  Protect

553	THE WARRIORS										  553
	   retreat across the courtyard to rope ladders that scale the

554	ARTHUR'S MEN CLIMB ATOP THE PARAPET					    554
	   The rope ladders are hastily pulled up, leaving no access.
555	INT. COURTYARD - SIX OF ARTHUR'S WARRIORS				   555
	   are stranded in the courtyard. They fight for their lives but

556	EVIL SHEILA										   556
	   takes out the last of the stranded warriors with her sword.
557	EVIL ASH											 557
	   smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower
	   just beyond the parapet.
					   EVIL ASH
			   The book shall be mine!
	   He raises his rusty sword.
			   LADDERS!
558	TWELVE EVIL DEAD									   558
	   storm the parapet with three crudely built wooden ladders as
	   large rocks rain down upon them from above.
559	TWO WARRIORS										  559

561	TWO SKELETONS ON LADDER #2							   561
	   leap onto the parapet and battle the men with swords.
562	WARRIOR #2										    562
	   knocks the deadite off the ledge and shouts back toward Arthur.
					   WARRIOR #2
			   We can't hold this wall much
			   longer!
563	A DEADITE ARROW									    563
	   pierces his armor and he falls to his death.
564	INT. COURTYARD										564
	   A VIKING DEADITE
	   looks up as he hears...
	   CHUG!  CHUG!  CHUG!
565	DEADITE'S P.O.V.									   565
	   THE DOORS OF THE BLACKSMITH'S SHOP BURST OPEN
	   Through the dust and smoke something appears...An iron
	   beast...belching steam...It's angry iron blades whirling.
	   Behold...
566	THE DEATHCOASTER									   566
	   The stripped chaise of the Delta  88 Oldsmobile. A steam engine
	   is mounted to it's center to power the craft. At the front and
	   rear are spinning, helicopter like rotor blades.
567	GOLD TOOTH										    567
	   shovels coal into the Deathcoaster's furnace.
568	ASH												 568
	   is at the helm. He pulls a cord.
569	THE DEATHCOASTER'S STEAM WHISTLE						  569
	   SCREAMS to announce its birth.
570	THE VIKING DEADITE									 570
	   is cut to ribbons by swirling blades.
571	THE VILLAGERS ATOP THE PARAPET						    571
	   cheer!
572	EVIL DEAD											572
	   at the base of the ladders look up in horror to see...
573	THE STEAM DRIVEN ROTOR BLADES							573
	   slicing through two Deadites at once. The cow-catcher in front
	   pushes aside the halved Evil Dead.
574	ASH												 574
	   operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer
	   the craft. It's a bumpy ride.
575	WIDE SHOT - THE DEATHCOASTER							 575
	   Thwop!  Thwop!  Two more skeletons bite the dust.
	   leathery hands pluck a SCREAMING Gold Tooth from the craft.
576	GOLD TOOTH										    576
	   disappears beneath the squirming corpses. A moment later he re-
	   emerges as a skeleton himself, except for the single gold tooth
	   that shines against the white of the bone. He stands and joins
	   the Deadites.
577	EVIL SHEILA										   577
	   leaps onto the moving Deathcoaster to face Ash.
					   EVIL SHEILA
			   Thou didst find me beautiful once.
					   ASH
			   Honey...You got real ugly.
578	EVIL SHEILA										   578
	   attacks with a SHRIEK!
579	ASH												 579
	   spins out his double barreled shot gun and...
	   BLAMMITY-BLAM!
	   ...blows her off the craft. She does a back flip into the other
	   Deadites.
580	ASH												 580
	   pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the
	   craft.
581	THE DEATHCOASTER									   581
	   careens out of control.
582	ASH												 582
	   tumbles from the helm and hits the ground.
583	THE DEATHCOASTER									   583
	   flips, crushes a group of Deadites against a wall, and explodes.
584	ASH												 584
	   picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to...
585	LADDER #2 - ARTHUR									 585
	   attempts to push the ladder away. A sword comes up into frame,
	   stabbing Arthur. He is yanked to his death with a shriek!  Evil
	   Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up from the ladder and onto
	   the parapet. He's headed for the Book of the Dead.
586	BELOW IN THE COURTYARD - ASH							 586
	   races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two
	   deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and
	   slices one end of it with his sword.
587	ABOVE HIM - A NET OF BOULDERS							587
	   plummet down atop the two deadites, crushing them.
	   Simultaneously, Ash is tanked upward by the rope, to the
	   parapet.
588	ASH												 588
	   looks to...
589	EVIL ASH											 589
	   approaching the Necronomicon.
590	ASH												 590
	   kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four
	   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires.
591	A FLAME ARROW										 591
	   imbeds in Evil Ash's leg and ignites his body. Another flaming
	   dart hits his shoulder blade. The flames consume his body. He
	   burns and SHRIEKS!
592	ASH												 592
	   watches in horror as...
593	THE FLAMES RECEED									  593
	   revealing a bone white skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL
	   EVIL ASH!  It races at Ash with a SHRIEK.
594	ASH AND EVIL ASH									   594
	   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks
	   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds
	   the Necronomicon.
	   CLANG!
	   With a deft stroke, Ash's sword is flung from his hand.
595	ASH'S SWORD										   595
	   imbeds in a wooden beam.
596	EVIL ASH											 596
	   grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash.
597	ASH												 597
	   grabs a burning iron torch from its mount.
598	ANGLE ON											 598
	   WHOOSH!  KLANG!  WHOOSH!  KLANG!
	   Man and Skeleton battle with flaming torch and sword.
599	ANGLE ON											 599
	   KLANG!
	   The torch is knocked from Ash's hand. It falls over the edge
	   of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It ignites a fuse.
	   The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The sack sits
	   upon the spoon of a catapult.
600	ABOVE...											 600
	   SKELETON ASH
	   swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings
	   downward, and Ash side steps it.
601	ASH												 601
	   rabbit punches CAMERA.
602	CLOSE ON SKELETON HEAD								  602
	   Ash's fist bursts out all it's rotted teeth.
603	ASH												 603
	   delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in
	   a circle.
604	THE SKELETON										  604
	   gives Ash a backwards roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles
	   over the edge.
605	ASH												 605
	   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances
	   at the burning fuse.
606	EVIL ASH											 606
	   leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton
	   looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone.
607	SKELETON ASH										  607
	   Behold...
	   He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now
	   battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the
	   Keep.
608	ANGLE ON SKELETON ASH								   608
					   SKELETON ASH
			   You're finished.
	   He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash.
					   SKELETON ASH
			   I possess the Necronomicon. I've
			   crushed your pathetic army. Now
			   I'll have my vengeance!
	   He raises his sword for the death blow...

					   GUARD (O.S.)
			   Duke Henry's men!  They've come!
610	ASH AND THE SKELETON								    610
	   turn...
	   A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as...
611	DUKE HENRY THE RED AND FIFTY OF HIS MEN					611
	   thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
	   courtyard to attack the Deadites!
612	THE SKELETON - ATOP THE CATAPULT						  612
	   turns back to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.
613	ASH												 613
	   has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion
	   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton
	   Ash.
614	ASH												 614
	   snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices
	   through the rope, springing the catapult.
615	THE SKELETON AND BURNING SATCHEL						  615
	   are flung over the castle wall.
616	HIGH SHOT - LOOKING DOWN AT CASTLE						616
	   THE SKELETON PROJECTILE
	   rockets up past camera, waving its boney arms. The burning
	   satchel follows.
	   BOOM!  The skeleton is blown to bits in mid air.
	   A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard as Henry's Warriors
	   crush the last of the Deadites.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
617	GLORIOUS BEAMS OF MORNING SUNLIGHT						617
	   streak over the horizon. Ash enters frame. He holds the
	   Necronomicon as he looks wearily out over the battlefield.
618	LONG SHOT - THE BATTLEFIELD - MORNING					  618
	   Smoking skeletons lay scattered. Henry and Arthur's Warriors
	   work together. They toss the deadite bones and armor into a

	   Form a row of archers.
	   They fire their flaming arrows toward the sea.
622	THE ARROWS										    622
	   strike a wooden ship that holds the body of Arthur.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure
			   we had our problems.  But in the
			   end, he was all right.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
623	EXT. SEASHORE - DUSK								    623
	   ASH AND THE OTHERS
	   watch the funeral pyre sail off.  It's flickering flames play

									   DISSOLVE TO:
624	INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT							624
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Peace was made between the two
			   peoples.  And a new nation was
			   formed.  They offered my a chance
			   to stay among them and teach them.
			   A chance to lead them.  To be
			   King.  But Sheila was gone.
			   Besides, I had places to go.
	   FLAMES OF THE FIRE - CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
625	THE WISEMEN										   625
	   mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from

	   the Necronomicon.  A flask is dipped into the liquid.
	   WISEMAN JOHN
	   hands the flask of liquid to Ash.
					   WISEMAN JOHN
			   The Book tells us that each drop
			   allows a man to sleep a century.
			   Swallow six drops, and thou shalt
			   awaken in thine own time.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Yeah.  Right...
	   Ash takes the flask and studies it.
			   ...but what other choice did I
			   have?
									   DISSOLVE TO:
626	EXT. CASTLE - LONG SHOT - DAY							626
	   ASH

					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I had to find a place to crash.
			   For a very long time.
627	EXT. CAVE - DAY									    627
	   ASH
	   with the aid of his horse, drags the Deathcoaster inside the
	   cave.
	   He sets the horse free.
					   ASH
			   YAHH!!
	   It gallops off.
628	INT. CAVE - DAY									    628
	   ASH
	   Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.  He
	   ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I locked the door.
629	INT. MOUTH OF THE CAVE								  629
	   BOOM!
	   The powder charge blows.  The cave's entrance is sealed shut
	   with an avalanche of rock.
630	INT. CAVE - DEATHCOASTER								630
	   The car headlights come on, piercing the blackness.
631	INT. DEATHCOASTER									  631
	   ASH
	   uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I closed my eyes.
	   He lets six drops fall into his mouth.  One for each century
	   he must sleep.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I took a drink.
	   Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A
	   7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   I didn't know if it was day or
			   night. I started... to get
			   drowsy... And I slept...
632	ASH												 632
	   falls into a deep slumber.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
633	THE DEATHCOASTER'S HEADLIGHTS							633
	   fade.
									   DISSOLVE TO:
634	CLOSER ON ASH'S SLEEPING FACE							634
	   now in a different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave.
					   ASH
			   ...And dreamed.
635	THE HANDS ON ASH'S WRISTWATCH							635
	   wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse
	   photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from
	   Ash's wrist.
636	THE SUN											  636
	   rises then sets.
637	THE MOON											 637
	   follows.
638	A CRACK											  638
	   forms along the surface of the aging rock wall.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   Dreams last lasted centuries.

639	A BARREN TREE										 639
	   sprouts buds, they swell forming leaves which change to the

640	A FROST											  640
	   covers Ash.
641	ICICLES											  641
	   on the ceiling of the cave melt.  The water drops down onto
	   Ash's face.  He stirs.
642	ASH												 642
	   awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the
	   Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is
	   buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs
	   at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams
	   into the hole he has created.
643	EXT. HILLSIDE										 643
	   ASH
	   climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight.
					   ASH (V.O.)
			   And when I awoke...
644	ASH												 644
	   beholds...
645	A FUTURISTIC CITY -									645
	   after the next Nuclear war: a dead land.
646	ASH'S P.O.V.										  646
	   A FRACTURED CLOCK TOWER
	   lays sprawled on its side.  The time of mankind's death frozen
	   on the cracked face of the clock.
647	A SHATTERED BRIDGE									 647
	   abruptly ends, a third of the way across a river it once
	   spanned.  Upon it, rest heaps of futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs
	   piled eight deep in some places.
	   CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces
	   of iron and bone.
					   ASH
			   ....I found that I had slept too
			   long.
648	ASH												 648
	   is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't
	   hear his terrified SCREAM!

     FADE IN:

     PERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK

     We know that we are looking at something because its
     polished surface shimmers with light.

     PULLING BACK, other squares are revealed; the black and
     white tiles of a chess board.

     The board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find
     ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board, MOVING THROUGH a chess
     game.

     The pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other
     pieces.  It has reached that critical moment when pieces
     are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies
     unravel towards a final outcome.

     Standing above the pieces around him, we see the black
     king.

     We MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face, CLOSER TO his chiseled
     ebony features, CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold
     black eyes...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK

     The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens.

     Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-
     less marsh.  It is fall, the first frost not far away and
     the foliage is brown and bare.  With the red-orange ball
     of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first
     appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
     mire.

     The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man.
     He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  A .22 caliber
     gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand.

     His name is ROBERT RATH.

     The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.  He is also wearing a
     very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
     brambles and mud.

     As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the
     mud.

                             KETCHAM
               Aw-shit!

     He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in
     the air.  He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud.
     He looks at Rath.

                             KETCHAM
               How much farther?

                             RATH
               Just a little ways.  Up to those
               trees.

     About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
     is a small cluster of trees.

                             KETCHAM
               Oh, fuck it.

     He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud.
     He smiles.  It feels good.  He hurls the sock.  Lifting
     his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  He
     grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off,
     laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud.

     Rath waits, a faint smile.

     He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
     both feet into the dark, wet earth.

                             KETCHAM
               Hey, this feels kinda good.

     They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet
     deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE.

                             KETCHAM
               Hey, do you mind if I talk a
               little?  I feel like, I don't
               know, talking I guess.

                             RATH
               Sure.

                             KETCHAM
               Funny, I've never been a talker.
               My wife was always getting on me
               about that.  'Say what you feel,
               tell me what's bothering you,
               you ve got to talk to me.'  I
               never would though.  Not really.

                               RATH
               Why not?

                               KETCHAM
               I don't know.  Part of me wanted
               to but part of me always said,
               'What's she going to be able to
               do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I
               didn't trust her.

     He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
     snowball.

                             KETCHAM
               My Margaret... I loved her but you
               know what?  I cheated on her.  All
               the time.  I don't even know why.
               It wasn't the sex, Margaret was
               great in bed.  I think if I wasn't
               married I wouldn't have even looked
               at some of those women.  I knew she
               couldn't trust me, so how could I
               trust her?  If she was here right
               now I'd think that I would tell her
               that I was sorry... 'course, if she
               were here right now, maybe I
               wouldn't feel like talking.

     He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are
     too far.

                             KETCHAM
               I think I've heard of you.

                             RATH
               It's possible.

                             KETCHAM
               You're pretty famous aren't you?

                             RATH
               I hope not.

                             KETCHAM
               I know this may seem like a strange
               question, but can I ask you how
               much the contract was for -- not
               to insult you or anything, I know
               you're a professional, but just
               for me, I was just wondering.

                             RATH
               It's a common question.

                             KETCHAM
               Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to
               see that price tag.  Like art,
               right?  You hang some painting
               that looks like baby-puke in your
               living room only if it costs a
               bundle.

                             RATH
               A dime.

                             KETCHAM
               One hundred thousand?  That's it?
               Jesus... Is that a lot?

                             RATH
               Average.

                             KETCHAM
               Shit... oh well.

     Ketcham laughs.

                             KETCHAM
               I have been thinking about this
               for a long while.  I knew this day
               was coming.  I knew someday
               someone would make the call on me.
               I never thought about anyone that
               I had whacked.  What do you call
               it anyway?

                             RATH
               Taken.

                             KETCHAM
               'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had
               someone taken I would call our
               General Contractor, transfer the
               money and as soon as I hung up the
               phone I forgot about them.

                             RATH
               Everyone who plays the game knows
               the rules.

                             KETCHAM
               That's exactly what I told myself.

     Ketcham laughs again.  He is getting kind of giggly, like
     he's high.

                             KETCHAM
               I always wondered what I'd be
               thinking at this exact moment.  I
               imagined that I would be thinking
               about the fucker who contracted
               this, trying to figure out who
               it was...

     Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.

                             RATH
               Don't know.  That's how it works.

                             KETCHAM
               That's what our General Contractor
               told us but how can you trust
               someone like that?

                             RATH
               Right.

                             KETCHAM
               I thought that I would be thinking
               about Margaret, or work, or that
               I'd be having these deep, profound
               and depressing thoughts but I'm
               not.  I'm trying to think really
               profound thoughts, but I can't.
               It seems very funny to me.

                             RATH
               What are you thinking about?

                             KETCHAM
               I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't
               that funny?  I haven't had a
               Moonpie since I was ten years old.
               Right now, I'm thinking how much
               I'd love one.

                             RATH
               And an R.C.

     He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him.  Ketcham suddenly
     stops laughing.  They are nearly to the cluster of trees.

                             KETCHAM
               Can I ask you something?

                             RATH
               Go ahead.

                             KETCHAM
               What do other guys do?

     He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.

                             RATH
               Everyone handles it differently.
               Some are ready, some are not.

                             KETCHAM
               Do they get down on their knees,
               begging and crying?

                             RATH
               Some.

                             KETCHAM
               When I thought about this, that
               was always there, in the back of
               my head, that image of me on my
               knees, crying.  It wouldn't go
               away and it would really upset me.
               It was something that I could never
               get away from... but now, I feel
               it's okay.  I feel good.

                             RATH
               Can I ask you a question?

                             KETCHAM
               Anything.

                             RATH
               Why didn't you fade?

                              KETCHAM
               You mean quit?

                              RATH
               Yeah.

                              KETCHAM
               I used to think about it.  I had
               Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I
               thought about moving somewhere
               far away like, Europe.  I could
               see all of that, the first part,
               the getting away but I couldn't
               see that next part.  'Then what?'
               So I'd stop thinking about it and
               go back to work.  You understand?

                             RATH
               Yeah.

     Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
     trees.

                             KETCHAM
               I always pictured that I would end
               in some land fill, under
               someone else's garbage.  I kept
               picturing those plastic diapers
               filled with some baby's green shit,
               covering me.  But this is nice...

     He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black
     horizon.

                               KETCHAM
               Look at that.  I haven't watched
               the sun set in a million years.
               Do you mind?

                             RATH
               No.

     Ketcham stares at the last of the light.

                             KETCHAM
               Nice... real nice.

     With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry.

     Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.  Rath
     looks down at the gun limply held in his hand.

     When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark-
     ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY
     FALLING INTO THE MUD.  After a beat we hear TWO MORE
     SHOTS.

     Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud,
     a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
     left by the dying sun.

     Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand-
     ing alone in the middle of nowhere.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     The room is dark and still.

     A man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the
     amber wash of urban light.

     Snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the
     city's electric night.

     The man finishes his bourbon, ICE CLINKING in the empty
     glass.  He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until
     his forehead rests against the window.

     In the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath.

     Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for
     Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the
     distant street below.

     He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself
     fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door.

     Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the
     bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed
     her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see
     that her dress is very short and very tight.

                             ESCORT (WOMAN)
               Hi.  Did you call --

                             RATH
               Yes.  Please come in.

     Her HIGH HEELS TAP against the tile foyer as she enters
     and he takes her coat.

                             ESCORT
               Goodness, it's so dark...

     She reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.

                             RATH
               I prefer it like this.

                             ESCORT
               How can a beautiful man like you
               be shy?

     He smiles.

                             RATH
               I prefer it, that's all.

     She moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her
     body radiating like heat.

                             ESCORT
               It's okay, honey.  We can do it
               anyway you want.

     Rath is obviously uncomfortable.

                             RATH
               Would you like a drink?

                             ESCORT
               I'd love one.  Whatever you're
               having.

     They move into the room, from a distance, as featureless
     as two shadows.

     She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a
     city night.

                             ESCORT
               Beautiful.

     He hands her the drink.  Her smile is bright and perfect.

                             ESCORT
               Good will towards men.

     Their glasses clink as he drains half his drink.  If she
     drinks at all, we can not tell.

                             RATH
               Why are you working today?

                             ESCORT
               Holidays are our busiest days.  No
               one likes to be alone on holidays.
               I know I don't.

     She touches his face, the caress and her expression of
     tenderness seemingly genuine.

                             RATH
               You're very good at this aren't
               you?

                             ESCORT
               I think you're supposed to answer
               that question.

     Her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any
     farther Rath turns away, returning to the bar.

                             RATH
               I know what you expect, but I
               don't want...

     He pours himself another drink.

                             ESCORT
               That's okay, hon, I always expect
               the unexpected.

                             RATH
               I called because I just want... I
               need to talk.

     She sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she
     becomes a listener.

                             RATH
               I've been thinking about my life,
               about things I have done... What I
               do for a living is in some ways
               similiar to what you do.

     He sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened
     by the alcohol.

                             RATH
               I know that everything has a
               price.  I want you to understand
               that I'm willing to pay.

     He takes out an envelope and puts it between them.  She
     picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred
     dollar bills.

                             ESCORT
               For what?

                             RATH
               Honesty.

     She puts the envelope down.

                             RATH
               I just want to ask you some
               questions.

     Uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for
     the right words.

                             RATH
               Do you ever regret things you've
               done?

                             ESCORT
               Everyone regrets something.

                             RATH
               But when you finLsh a job,
               afterwards do you think about
               them?

                             ESCORT
               Sometimes.

                             RATH
               Do you think about their wives or
               their families?

                             ESCORT
               No.  They call me, I don't call
               them.  If they didn't call I
               wouldn't exist.

     Rath nods.  His next question is barely audible.

                             RATH
               Do you ever think about starting
               over?

                             ESCORT
               All the time.

                             RATH
               Can you tell me about it?

     For the first time we really see her take a drink.  She
     closes her eyes.

                             ESCORT
               Sometimes I dream that I meet a
               man, this good, honest man and we
               fall in love.  I imagine us living
               on a boat, reading books, sailing
               to places where no one knows who
               we were or cares what we did.

     She opens her eyes and looks at him.

                             RATH
               And what if you never meet that
               man?

     She smiles.

                             ESCORT
               Then, I'll sail alone.

                             RATH
               Do you believe that?

                             ESCORT
               Are you asking me if I believe in
               another life?

     Rath nods.

                             ESCORT
               I have to.

     She finishes her drink.

                             ESCORT
               Is that all you want?

                             RATH
               Yes.

     She picks up the money and stands.

                             RATH
               Thank you.

                             ESCORT
               Anytime.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     It is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room
     service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about.

     He has been here for a while.

     He is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess
     game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the
     same positions as in the opening sequence.

     He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and
     then finishes off another bottle of bourbon.

     He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches
     over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a
     black rook.

     A sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving
     both the black and white pieces.  Suddenly he stops.  He
     gets up and shifts to the other side of the board,
     studying the game from white's perspective.

     Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through
     it as he moves around the table, returning to his place
     behind the black king.

     The games reaches its end as black is check-mated.

     He slumps down onto the table and looks across at the
     white king.

                             RATH
               Fuck you, Nick.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

     Rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer
     office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with
     cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax
     machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer.

     On the table near the desk, we see the .22, dismantled
     and cleaned, spread out on a white towel.

     He types in a complicated access code sequence, then
     waits, staring at the blank screen.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Where have you been, Robert?

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Sick.  The flu.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I don't believe you.

                             RATH
               I don't give a fuck --

                             RATH/SCREEN
               It's true.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I have been sitting on a contract
               from Cleveland for six days
               because of you.

                             RATH
               Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck
               your contracts --

                             RATH/SCREEN
               I need a rest.

                             CONTRACTOR/ SCREEN
               That's impossible, Robert.  You're
               at the top of your field.  These
               are the best contracts.  To stop
               now would be self-destructive.

     He looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on
     the table.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Send the file.  I'll have the
               estimate tonight.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I'm worried about you, Robert.

                             RATH
               You fucking should be --

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Don't be.

     On the screen the word "Transmitting" appears.  Rath
     slowly gets out of his chair.

     The FAX MACHINE CLICKS and HUXS to life as a photograph
     of a smiling, old Italian man curls onto the desk.

     Rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything
     he can get his hands on.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

     Rath is in the middle of the room which he has
     demolished.  Having showered and shaved, he is now
     standing naked, in the midst of the rubble, practicing
     the slow and graceful art of Tai Chi.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Rath is working at the desk.  He is tallying numbers,
     materials, totaling his estimate.

     Spread out over the table are several faxed photos of
     the old Italian, Leevio Valli, usually surrounded by
     bodyguards.

     The file details Valli's life and his daily routine.  It
     includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account
     statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the
     real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his
     income tax return.

     Satisfied with his figures, Rath plugs the phone into the
     modem and makes a call.

     The network comes on-line as the General Contractor
     types:

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               You're too late, Robert.

     Rath types.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               What?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               The contract was stolen.

     Rath stares at the screen.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Who?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               A new player.  He's using the name
               Nicholai.

     The name hits Rath and he sits, unable to breathe.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               You know what must be done.

     The screen goes black as the network shuts down.

     Rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts.  He lifts
     a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant
     appears every Friday.  The name of the restaurant has been
     circled in red pen by Rath:  "Trattoria Roma."


     EXT. TRATTORIA ROMA - NIGHT

     A red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian
     restaurant.


     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     It is a large establishment with many tables and booths.
     The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian
     families who have been eating here for years.

     Rath is sitting alone at a booth.  With very subtle
     changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian.

     In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine.
     He touches neither of them.  His eyes shift as he studies
     the room.

     LEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five
     gorillas in Italian suits.  The owner hurries to greet
     them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian.

     The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over-
     sized booth in the back.

     Rath does not look twice at them.  Immediately he is
     watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin.

     Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit
     around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the
     room.

     A wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and
     fills their glasses.  A pretty waitress sets a steaming
     loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in
     front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles.
     They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back
     to the kitchen.

     At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their
     glasses.

     It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first
     to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is
     the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is
     BAIN.  He smiles.

     The goon reaches for his gun as --

     Bain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face.  He
     screams.

     Leevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a GUN flashes free
     from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm.

     It happens instantly.  FOUR SHOTS and the goons are dead.

     Leevio screams.

                             LEEVIO
               Don't!

     A FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT.

     Leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table.

     Bain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON
     from his belt expecting an attack.

     Facing the screaming crowd, he begins to SHOOT anyone who
     moves or stands, men or women.

     There is chaos in the restaurant.  People scream, falling
     to the ground, scrambling under tables.

     Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of
     the room to the other.

     The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who
     are sobbing.

     He moves through the room, watching, searching.

                             BAIN
               Don't anybody move.  You move,
               you're dead.

     He passes the table Rath was sitting at, but it is empty.

                             BAIN
               Come on, you chicken shit
               motherfucker.  I know you're here.
               Let's go.


     EXT. CONCRETE PARKING GARAGE

     Across the street from Trattoria Roma, Rath jacks together
     a German assault rifle with night scope.


     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     Bain looks out the window at the dark street.

     He turns and searches through the people huddled on the
     floor.  He aims his gun.

                             BAIN
               You!  Get up!

     A quivering wine steward stands.

     He points to another.

                             BAIN
               You, too!  Up!


     EXT. PARKING GARAGE

     THROUGH the NIGHT SCOPE we see the front door to the
     restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped
     together slowly back out.


     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     Bain is second from the end, both guns aimed at the
     stewards.

     One of them begins to cry.

                             BAIN
               Not yet.  Don't move or you're
               fucking dead.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath moves the scope back and forth, unable to pick out
     the assassin.

                             RATH
               Shit.  Just do them all.  All of
               them.  Shit.

     He can't pull the trigger.


     EXT. TRATTORIA STOREFRONT

     The group moves toward the street.

                             BAIN
               Now run!

     Like dogs out of the gate, they bolt.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath watches as they scatter, finding Bain in his scope.


     EXT. STREET

     A chunk of BRICK EXPLODES from the wall just behind Bain's
     head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the
     curb.  He laughs.  We get the idea that Bain is enjoying
     this.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath looks over his scope, talking to himself.  He is
     sweating.

                             RATH
               Shit.  What are you doing, old man?
               You're too fucking slow.

     He looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line
     of cars.

                              RATH
               Okay.  Which one?  Which one is
               yours?


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars,
     staying low and out of sight.

     He works his way up to a black Mercedes that is parked
     illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys.
     He hits the remote unlocking the doors.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope, almost obscured
     by the parked Mercedes.

                             RATH
               Amateur.

     He takes aim.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Just as Bain starts to open the door, the front TIRE
     EXPLODES.  Another second, the back TIRE EXPLODES.

                             BAIN
               Fuck!


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath waits, steely calm, his finger on the trigger.

                             RATH
               Your move.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain hears the growing wail of POLICE SIRENS.  Thinking
     for a moment, he opens the car door and pulls a long
     handled switchblade and a roll of electrician's tape from
     the glove compartment.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath sees the car light go on, but can't make out what
     Bain is doing.  The SIRENS are GETTING LOUDER.  There's a
     lot of them.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls
     his shirt sleeve down.  From his pocket he takes out a
     Gameboy and begins playing "Tetris."


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath watches as the police cars come racing down the
     street.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     The CARS SCREECH to a halt in front of the restaurant.
     The COPS jump out, drawing their weapons.

     Bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air.

                             BAIN
               Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I give
               up!

     More CARS come SCREECHING up as the two officers hold
     their beads on Bain.

                             COP
               Hit the ground!  Face down!  Spread
               your legs!

     Bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him,
     frisking him.  In this position the Cop is unable to find
     the knife strapped to Bain's forearm, but finds the
     Gameboy.

                             BAIN
               Hey, don't touch that!

                             COP
               Shut up!

     The Cop twists Bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing
     him tightly.

     They drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and
     paramedics in the street.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the
     police car, but is unable to get a clean shot.  Bain is
     using the cops for cover, keeping his head low.

                             RATH
               Son of a bitch.

     The Cops shove Bain into the back seat.

     Rath very quickly walks to his car, tossing his gun into
     the trunk.  He gets in and STARTS the ENGINE.


     INT. PATROL CAR

     The two Officers are outside the car talking with the
     sergeant.

     Bain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the
     shadowy parking garage.  He smiles.

     The two Policemen get in the car, the second picking up
     the radio.  The driver GUNS the ENGINE and the black and
     white RUMBLES down the street.

                             COP #2
               This is 181, returning with suspect
               involved in multiple shooting at
               Trattoria Roma.  Repeat, en route
               with suspect.

     He hangs up the radio and looks back at Bain through the
     metal caging.

                             COP #2
               Jesus Christ, do you know who you
               shot in there?

     Bain almost laughs.

                             COP #2
               What are you?  Some kind of a
               hitman?

     Bain looks out the window.

                             COP #2
               You know what we call guys like you?

     Bain looks at him.

                             COP #2
               Sizzle lean.  They're gonna fry your
               ass.

     He laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who
     chuckles.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Rath's car races down the street trying to catch up with
     the patrol car.


     INT. PATROL CAR

     Bain stares out the window, silent.

     Behind his back, he takes hold of his left thumb with his
     right hand.

     The Cop is playing with the Gameboy.

     With a quick jerk, he yanks the thumb out of its socket.
     His expression remains perfectly blank.

     The thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand.  The skin
     stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his
     wrist.

     The Cop turns as the SWITCHBLADE CLICKS and Bain sticks
     the knife through the wire mesh, into the cop's eye.  A
     font of blood arcs onto the windshield.

     Grabbing hold of the driver's shirt collar, Bain jabs the
     blade into the back of his neck.

     The driver screams trying to pull free of Bain's grip.

     He slams on the brakes, groping for his gun and the CAR
     SKIDS out of control.

     Bain stabs the Cop again, his GUN FIRING WILDLY as --

     The patrol car starts to flip and roll.


     INT. RATH'S CAR

     Rath turns as he hears an EXPLOSION, several blocks away.
     The TIRES SQUEAL as he makes a hard right.


     EXT. STREET

     Orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned
     patrol car.  Oil black clouds billow into the night sky.

     Rath's car cruises past.

     Rath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out.

     Bain is gone.

                             RATH
               I'm not done yet.


     EXT. CITY STREET INTERSECTION

     A brand new cab is sitting at a red light.

     The cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of
     headlights roll up behind him.  The car gets closer, the
     lights brighter; they don't stop.

     He shrieks as the CAR SMASHES INTO HIS, TEARING OFF HIS
     BUMPER.

     The cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities.

     Rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as
     the cabby moves toward him.

     When he's close enough, Rath decks him, knocking him
     unconscious.

     He picks him up and puts him in the white car.

     Rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to
     green, he drives off.


     INT. CAB

     Rath circles the area, turning up the cab's CB.

     A couple of CALLS CRACKLE through the speaker, before he
     hears what he's waiting for; an airport fare in this area.
     At the intersection of Adams and Nine.

     He picks up the mike.

                              RATH
               This is 1242.  I got it.


     EXT. ADAMS AND NINE

     It is a deserted intersection.  The buildings are dark and
     some of the street lights are out.

     The cab sits by itself, ENGINE RUNNING, its taillights
     glowing through the exhaust.


     INT. CAB

     Rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat.  His other
     hand grips the door handle.

     As he waits, watching the intersection, he notices the
     cabby's ID pinned to the dashboard.

     Leaving the gun in his jacket, he reaches for the ID card.

     He rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the
     seat, the door behind him opens.  Someone gets in and
     closes the door.  Rath peers into the rearview mirror.

     It is Bain.

     For the first time we realize that the front and back of
     the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass.

     There is an awkward silence as Rath sits, unsure.

     Bain looks at him.

                             BAIN
               Is there a problem?

                             RATH
               No.  No problem.  The airport,
               right?

                             BAIN
               Right.

     The cab pulls out of the intersection.


     INT. CAB

     Rath studies Bain.  There is a thin line of blood down his
     temple.  Bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his
     Gameboy, resuming his game of Tetris.

                             RATH
               How'd you cut yourself?

     Their voices are distorted through the small electric
     amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal
     money exchanger.

     Bain touches the blood on his forehead, looking at it a
     bit surprised.

                             BAIN
               Oh?  Working.  A little accident.

     He wipes it off as best he can.

                             RATH
               You a waiter?  You look like a
               waiter.

     Bain is uninterested.

                             BAIN
               Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.

                             RATH
               Where?

                             BAIN
               What?

                             RATH
               What restaurant?

                             BAIN
               Uh, Fontella's

                             RATH
               So you're from around here?

                             BAIN
               No.  No I'm not.

     Bain is getting agitated.

                             RATH
               Where you from?

                             BAIN
               What is this?

                             RATH
               Not too good at small talk, eh?

                             BAIN
               Look, I'm real tired and I'm not
               interested in fucking chit-chat.

                             RATH
               I know just what you mean.  I'm
               pretty beat myself.

     Silence.

                             RATH
               Since you looked like a waiter, I
               had to ask what restaurant because
               of what happened at the Trattoria
               Roma.

     Bain looks up.

                             BAIN
               Why?  What happened?

                             RATH
               Didn't you here all them sirens?
               It's been all over the radio.  Some
               guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch
               of bystanders, in the Trattoria
               Roma.

                             BAIN
               No shit.

                             RATH
               Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli,
               and I don't care what office he's
               running for, the guy's a crook.  He
               probably had it coming, but all the
               other people.  Real sad.

                             BAIN
               Yeah.

                             RATH
               But they caught the guy.  I heard it
               all.  Sounded like he just went
               berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting
               anybody.  Drugs, probably.

                             BAIN
               Probably.

                             RATH
               I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send
               that S.O.B. right to the chair.

     Bain allows himself a bemused smile.

                             BAIN
               Sizzle lean.

     The cab passes the intersection for the airport.

     Bain sits up.

                             BAIN
               What are you doing?

                             RATH
               What?

                             BAIN
               That was Peterson back there.  That
               goes to the expressway for the
               airport.

                             RATH
               You're right.  Talking too much
               again.

                             BAIN
               Yeah well, you just blew your tip,
               pal.

                             RATH
               What?  You think I'm running you up?

                             BAIN
               Just do your job.

     Rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park.

                             BAIN
               What are you doing?

                             RATH
               Get out.  You think I'm running you
               up?  Get out.

                             BAIN
               You can't --

                             RATH
               The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I
               don't like you.  So, get the hell
               out!

     Bain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the
     dashboard and the missing ID.

     Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror.

                             BAIN
               Holy fucking shit!

     The cab rocks as both men move.  Instantly guns fill their
     hands.  Bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the
     dead cops.  Rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free
     from his jacket.

     Bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops.  He
     looks at Rath.  He wants him to run.  Anyone who moves
     away from the bullet proof glass is dead.

     Both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun
     sights.

     Bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip.

                             BAIN
               I get out, you got me.

     Bain reaches over and closes the door.  He smiles knowing
     it is the right move.

                             BAIN
               Now what?

     Rath calmly uncocks his gun.

                             RATH
               We're both going to the airport.

     Bain nods.

                             RATH
               Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.

                             BAIN
               No fucking way.

                             RATH
               Okay, don't.

     Bain thinks.

                             RATH
               If either of us fucks around, the
               other can blow the fuel line.

     He points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs.

     Bain sits back, aiming his gun, watching Rath.

     Rath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his
     gun on the fuel line.

     He puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic,
     turning back towards Peterson.

     They sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit
     the expressway.  Bain can't contain himself, giddy on
     adrenaline.

                             BAIN
               Jesus -- I'm being driven to the
               airport by Robert Rath.

     He laughs.

                             BAIN
               I can't believe this.  You rolled
               some cabby for the radio, then
               waited for an airport fare.

     He laughs again.

                             BAIN
               Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're
               a fucking genius.  Then you're just
               sitting there, bullshitting with me.
               Man, no way I coulda done that!

                             RATH
               What's your name?  We both know it's
               not Nicholai.

                             BAIN
               Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to
               know my name.

     He leans back.  This is a big moment for him.

                             BAIN
               Bain.  Michael Bain.

                             RATH
               How long have you been freelance?

                             BAIN
               Two years.  Two long fucking years.

     Something occurs to him and he leans close to the window.

                             BAIN
               Hey.  What I don't get was why
               didn't you take the shot inside the
               restaurant?  I mean you had me, a
               free shot.  That's what I would have
               done.

                             RATH
               It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty-
               forty, at best.  Not my odds.

                             BAIN
               Sounds like chickenshit --

     He laughs hard.

                             BAIN
               Listen to me calling you
               chickenshit!

     He stops laughing and looks closely at the back of Rath's
     head.

                             BAIN
               Is that a wig?  Shit, I hate wigs!
               Wigs are the worst part of this job.
               I'd rather dye my hair than wear a
               wig.

     Rath studies him.

                             RATH
               You're wearing a wig now.

     Bain chokes on his laugh.

                             BAIN
               God damn are you good.  Everyone
               says you're so fucking good.  I just
               can't believe I'm still alive.  If I
               believed in God, I'd be down on my
               knees.  Right now -- Hey, how come
               you just didn't plug us all when we
               came through the door?

     Rath does not answer.  Bain smiles.  He knows something
     about Rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people.

                             BAIN
               Shit if I was you, back there --

     He holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind Rath's
     head.

                             BAIN
               Game over.

     He laughs.

                             BAIN
               Do you mind if I ask you a couple of
               business questions?  You know I was
               wondering how much you bid this job
               at?

     Rath says nothing.

                             BAIN
               You don't have to tell me that.
               It's just, I know my bid was low,
               but was it too low?  I mean, did I
               seem like an amateur, like I didn't
               know what I was doing?

                             RATH
               We both know what you were doing.

     Bain moves close to the glass again, checking out Rath's
     gun.

                             BAIN
               Smith and Wesson .22 with an eight
               inch silencer.  Classic.  When I
               first heard you used that, I
               thought, shit, that's a lady's gun.
               Now, it's all I use.  Clean, real
               clean.

     He looks at the gun, still trained at the floor.

                             BAIN
               Would you really blow us?

     Rath does not have to answer.

                             BAIN
               Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this
               has been driving me crazy for years
               -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like
               some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but
               I just got to ask you.  Everybody
               talks about how you left the Agency
               and got into the business and then
               how you went after the Russian,
               Nicholai Talinkov --

                             RATH
               Tachlinkov.

                             BAIN
               Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a
               fucking genius.  They said he shaded
               you over and over.  And in the end,
               he aced you again.  Shaded and
               faded.  They say he's living on some
               Greek island, but I say that's
               fucking bullshit.  I say you're the
               best and that you planted his ass.
               Am I right?

     Rath says nothing.

                             BAIN
               I bet I'm right.

     The car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the
     Cleveland airport.

                             BAIN
               Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus
               fucking Christ!

                             RATH
               After those cops, you'll never be
               able to come back to Cleveland.

                             BAIN
               Who the fuck cares about Cleveland.
               Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks
               have they got here?  Greasy mobster,
               teamster or some hand job
               politician.  I want the money marks.
               I want the marks that you get.

     A long beat of silence.

     The CAB RUMBLES up onto the "departures" ramp which
     circles past all of the terminals.

                             BAIN
               So what happens now?

                             RATH
               We go around once.

                             BAIN
               Bullshit.

     He throws off his seatbelt.

                             BAIN
               You tell me that we're gonna go
               around once, then, while I'm
               checking out the lay of the land,
               you bail out and send me flying over
               the bridge.  Right?  Am I right?

     Rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the
     police and airport security.

     Rath studies the terrain.  Bain studies Rath.

     Soon they have passed the entire airport.  Rath nods.
     Steering the car through traffic in onto a circle
     interchange that will bring them to the beginning.

     Bain wipes the sweat from his face.

                             RATH
               Okay.

                             BAIN
               What?  What's okay?

     Rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange.

                             BAIN
               What are you doing?

                             RATH
               There's a sand barricade up ahead;
               I'm going to ram this cab into it.
               The cab has an airbag, odds are good
               I'll survive.  But with this steel
               casing and bullet proof glass, odds
               for you are not so good.

     Bain laughs.

                             BAIN
               Oh man, that's sweet.  That's
               fucking sweet.

     The speedometer continues to climb.

                             BAIN
               You're bluffing.

     Rath says nothing.  Ahead, at the ramp to the terminals,
     is the sand barricade.

                             BAIN
               You're fucking with me.  You want me
               to jump.  I jump, you hit the brakes
               and bang -- Game over.

     The cab is flying at its target.

                             BAIN
               No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to
               jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm
               stuck back here until it's too late.
               Wham -- over!

                             RATH
               I know you're going to jump.

     Bain looks at him and then at the barricade.

                             RATH
               You're still young.  Young enough to
               still think you're indestructible.
               Invincible.  You believe with utter
               certainty you can bail out at the
               last second and survive.

     The barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the
     windshield.

                             RATH
               If you do survive, we'll see each
               other again.

     Bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself
     out.

     Rath jams on the brakes, TIRES SCREAMING, steering into
     the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of
     sand as --

     Bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped
     across water.

     A driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him.

     SAND EXPLODES from the impact and the cab bounces up over
     the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag
     balloons out of the steering wheel.

     Bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a
     piece of roadkill.

     The cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the
     radiator spitting out a cloud of WHISTLING STEAM.

     Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car
     stopping inches from him.  A woman jumps out, rushing to
     the front of the car, but Bain is gone.

     Police CARS ROAR up into the midst of the accident.  One
     of them pulling alongside the demolished cab.  The door is
     open, the airbag popped.  Rath is gone.


     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     A large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - DAY

     The apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the
     windows.

     The dining and living rooms look like the control booth of
     a network television show, stacks of video monitors and
     consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic
     cord duct-taped to the floors, walls and ceilings.  They
     snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang
     everywhere like some technological jungle.

     At the center of this tangled web is ELECTRA, a beautiful
     athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a
     worn robe.  She is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a
     bowl of popcorn in her lap.

     On the monitors, she is watching what at first might be
     mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an
     argument.

     What is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish-
     eye lens staring down into the room.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               I don't give a shit what your mother
               thinks.  I'm not sleeping with your
               mother, I'm sleeping with you.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               You won't be for long, with that
               attitude.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               Jesus, Jennifer, if you're so god
               damned worried about your mother's
               approval, why don't you move back
               home so she can pat you on the head
               when you do something right.

                             ELECTRA
               Jerk.

     Jennifer is too stunned to say anything.  There is a long
     pause that is not at all like television.  It seems very
     real.

     She starts to say something, but stops, trying to keep
     herself from crying.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               Oh good.  Go ahead and cry.

                             JENNIFER (WOMAN) (V.O.)
               Would you please leave?

     Electra lifts her head, smelling the air.

                             ELECTRA
               Mmm, smell that, Nikita?

     Nikita, Electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across
     the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently.  Every
     corner of the chair has been clawed open.

     Electra reaches for the control board and throws a series
     of switches.

     The monitors flicker as the image changes.  We are now
     looking down into a kitchen.  A stove is beneath us,
     almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking
     out a tray of chocolate chip cookies.

     Electra smells them again, smiling as she inhales.

                             ELECTRA
               I hope she saves some for us.

     There is a BANG, a DOOR SLAMMING in another apartment, and
     a MAN YELLING.

     Electra switches back to Jennifer's apartment.

     The man is still in the living room, but Jennifer is gone.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               Do you think slamming doors is going
               to help work this out?

     Electra punches a command into a keyboard.  Several of the
     screens change, showing different rooms of the same
     apartment.  Jennifer is in the bedroom, lying on the bed
     sobbing, her face buried in a pillow.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               I can slam doors too!

     We hear the front DOOR SLAM in the hall outside of
     Electra's apartment and through the monitor speakers.  His
     stomping FOOTSTEPS FADE as he storms down the hall and
     staircase out of the building.

     Electra switches all of the screens to Jennifer.

     She watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom.

     Electra reaches out; her fingers lightly touch the monitor
     screen.


     INT. APARTMENT HALL

     Electra's front door opens slowly.  Timidly, she steps out
     of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is
     standing in front of Jennifer's door.

     She starts to knock, but stops herself.  She isn't sure
     she should do this.

     She paces, then turns to the door.

     She knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear.

     She stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when
     she hears Jennifer.

                             JENNIFER (O.S.)
               Hello?  Ken, is that you?

     Electra panics.

     The door knob turns, the door opens and JENNIFER looks out
     into the hall.  It is empty.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     On the monitors, Electra watches Jennifer pick up the
     phone.

                             JENNIFER (V.O.)
               Hi, Mom, it's me.  Ken and I just
               had a big fight.

     Electra's PAGER suddenly SOUNDS.  She shuts down the
     screens and pulls out the pager, checking the number.

                             ELECTRA
               Crap.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     There is a system set up that is not unlike Rath's system;
     all of the same components, though the equipment is
     bigger, more powerful and less portable.

     On a table there is a bank of phones, several cellular.
     Electra is talking on one.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Electra, they are not paying you to
               sit at home and watch television.

     Electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks; each
     has a MicroCell trademark and is labeled "Back-Up."

                             ELECTRA
               I wasn't watching television.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               The point is, they are paying for
               information.  Real information.  Not
               tooth paste brands.  Not whether he
               wads of folds his toilet paper.  And
               no 16 hours of recorded phone sex.
               You are wasting everyone's time with
               this shit.

                             ELECTRA
               I thought it was interesting --

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               God damnit, Electra.  This is not a
               game.  This is business.

                             ELECTRA
               Right.  In my hands I have five
               back-up disks he made of all of his
               work last night.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?

                             ELECTRA
               I'll make my usual arrangements and
               expect my usual bonus.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Electra --

                             ELECTRA
               A pleasure doing business with you.

     She hangs up.


     INT. LOBBY

     Electra comes down the stairs.

     Outside the large glass door she sees KEN, Jennifer's
     boyfriend, leaving.

     On the lobby floor is a letter, apparently slipped under
     the door, addressed to Jennifer Morgan.

     Electra looks out the front door window, making sure that
     Ken is gone.

     She picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Rath is at his computer system.

     He is staring at it, like it is a living thing, a person
     that he despises, the blank screen reflecting his own
     face.  It is an effort to bring himself to touch the
     keyboard, to type in his code.

     He waits.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Hello, Robert.

     Rath wants to type something but hesitates.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I know what happened.

                             RATH
               I bet you fucking know!

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               It cost us.

     Rath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen.

                             RATH
               I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit!
               Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking
               gone!

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               He stole another contract.

     Rath turns from the monitor, pacing.  Trying to collect
     himself.

                             RATH
               I'm being set up.  Fucking set up!

     He looks at the chess board.  He hovers over it, the
     pattern completely familiar.

                             RATH
               Is this how it went, Nick?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Robert?  Robert?

     Rath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               How did he know?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Know what?

                             RATH/SCREEN
               The fucking contract!  How in the
               fuck did he know.

     A long beat.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Such language in front of a lady.

     Rath still talking and typing.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               I don't know what the fuck you are.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I know.  It was a joke.

     Rath stands, no longer typing.

                             RATH
               A joke?  A joke?

     Rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the
     screen.

                             RATH
               You think this is a fucking joke?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               $1,000,000.

     Rath looks at the number.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               That's the bonus on the contract.

     Rath puts the gun down.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Deadline?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese.
               His retirement a condition of the
               bonus.

     The FAX MACHINE COMES TO LIFE, printing an inky image.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Who is the mark?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance
               specialist.

                             RATH
               A player?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               We have an M.O... Her system is
               protected by her 'pussy virus.'

     Rath looks at the fax; almost entirely black except for
     the wide, slit-iris cat eyes.


     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     There is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches
     down, heat rising off the tarmac.


     INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     Several passengers walk through the gate into the
     terminal.

     Across from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport
     cafeteria, reading a folded paper.

     He is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered
     to his side.

     Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph
     of a Japanese man wanted for "industrial espionage."

     At the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group
     is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously
     muscle.

     Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall.
     When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper
     and begins to follow.

     His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His
     focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to
     find Bain's.

     His hand hovers near his gun.

     Ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench
     coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face.

     The man starts toward a drinking fountain.

     Rath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, but
     he isn't sure.

     The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of
     water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22.

     A mouthful of water coughs from his mouth.

     It is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone.

                             RATH
               Sorry.  My mistake.

     Rath continues.  They young man is unable to move.


     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     The five men stride through the automated terminal doors
     and towards a waiting limousine.

     Further down, Rath, now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans,
     exits and hails a cab.


     INT. CAB

                             RATH
               Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that
               black limo.  We're not sure which
               hotel we're at, so could you just
               follow them?

                             CABBY
               Sure.

     Rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as
     the cab pulls away.


     INT. LIMOUSINE

     The five men sit in silence.  Strangely, a PHONE begins to
     RING.

     The older man, whose name is AKIRA, opens his briefcase,
     removing a cellular phone.

                             AKIRA
               Hello?

     We hear Electra's voice.  She speaks in Japanese; he uses
     English.

                             ELECTRA (V.O.)
               I trust your flight was comfortable?

                             AKIRA
               Your Japanese is excellent.

                             ELECTRA (V.O.)
               Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone.

                             ELECTRA
               I'll call you again in twenty
               minutes.

     She punches a button and shoves the antennae down.

     The hotel room looks like her apartment.  There is a
     computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the
     wood laminate desk.  Cables whip and wind across the
     carpeted floor to the central air duct.

     The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray
     coaxial run up inside the duct.

     Immediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations.
     She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on-
     line.

     On the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that
     looks exactly like the one she is in.


     INT. CAB

     Rath stares out the window, watching the surrounding
     traffic, the limo still in sight.

     Something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded
     newspaper where he had hid the contract file.

     He flips past several documents before finding what he's
     looking for; the cat.

     He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches
     Electra rush about.

     Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks
     it out.

                             ELECTRA
               Excuse me, your Highness.

     Nikita casually walks off the bed.

     Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a
     long piece of duct-tape.


     EXT. HYATT HOTEL

     The limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway.

     The cab pulls in behind it.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone.


     INT. HYATT LOBBY

     The Japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and
     uncomfortable.

     The BRIEFCASE RINGS.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is pacing again.

                             ELECTRA
               Room 1414.


     INT. HYATT LOBBY

     With several other guests, the Japanese men crowd into an
     elevator.  The doors close.

     Across the lobby, Rath enters, walking past the elevators.


     INT. ELEVATOR

     As the elevator rises, we begin to hear a SOUND, a
     familiar sound.

     Cramped in the corner is Bain.  He is PLAYING "TETRIS,"
     wearing dark sunglasses and a WALKMAN PUMPING SPEED METAL
     into his ears.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra continues to pace, checking the monitors.


     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN

     At the switchboard, a YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE wearing an
     operator's headset, takes a late breakfast order, typing
     the order in the hotel computer.

                             YOUNG MAN (YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE)
               Yes, sir.  That'll be up in about
               thirty minutes.  You're welcome.

     He turns around and Rath is right behind him.


     INT. ELEVATOR

     The fourteenth floor; the BELL CHIMES, the doors slide
     open and the clump of Japanese men get out.

     Just as the doors begin to close, Bain steps out.


     INT. HALL

     Bain follows them down the hall, still PLAYING the GAME.
     There is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on
     its prey.

     As Akira finds 1414 and opens the door, another door burst
     open, a large family, heading for the pool.

     The moment is gone; the Japanese men close the door and
     Bain continues down the hall again, PLAYING the GAME.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     When the Japanese men enter the suite, we realize that
     this is the image on Electra's monitors.  Surveillance
     camcorders and microphones are mounted in various
     locations to display every inch of the room.  The group
     hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes.

     The four goons have their hands in their jackets.

     A small LAPTOP COMPUTER sits on the coffee table HUMMING
     SOFTLY.  It is the only noise in the room until a speaker
     crackles.

                             ELECTRA/SPEAKER (V.O.)
               Good morning, gentlemen.  I
               apologize for the arrangement, but
               we all know those aren't business
               cards you're reaching for.  If
               anyone leaves this room, the deal's
               off.


     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN

     The operator is unconscious, slumped in the corner.

     Rath studies the hotel computer screen intently, the
     information rolling by.

     We see that it is the previous night's room service
     receipts.

                             RATH
               One vegetarian plate and a can of
               tuna fish.  Room 1014.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men
     as she speaks into the microphone.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten thousand dollars per disk.
               Insert the first disk now.

     On the monitor, we see Akira at the coffee table shove the
     first disk into the laptop disk drive.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     Akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a
     goon, who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar
     bills, down the central air duct.

     The little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies.


     INT. HYATT HALL

     Bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of
     "TETRIS."

     Suddenly, he stops.

                             BAIN
               Yes!

     The display of the game reads "Game Over" and
     congratulates Bain on a new high score.

     Bain stands, smiling.  He puts the game in his pocket and
     starts down the hall.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is crouched at the open duct, grabbing another
     stack of money, stuffing it into her bag.

     A LOUD BANG EXPLODES out of the SPEAKERS and she looks up
     at the monitor.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     The lock on the door has been broken and standing in the
     frame is Bain.

                             BAIN
               Surprise!

     He raises his arm, his GUN spitting SILENT BULLETS.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the
     nearest bodyguard, FIRING a SHOT into his belly.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh, God.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     Another SHOT and the second bodyguard falls.  The other
     two draw their handguns and Bain shields himself with the
     lifeless body of his first victim.

     They FIRE at Bain but are unable to hit him.

     Bain squeezes off TWO MORE SHOTS and the two men fall
     dead.  He lets his human shield fall to the ground and
     levels his gun on the shaking Akira.

                             AKIRA
               Don't kill me.

     Bain looks at him and smiles, then FIRES.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the
     modem.

     Bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it.

                             BAIN (V.O.)
               Tricky.  Boy, you just can't trust
               anyone these days.

     He licks the lens, leaving a smear of saliva.

     She stuffs the disks into her bag.  She puts Nikita in her
     "travel kitty" and charges for the door, grabbing her
     coat.

     Flinging it over her shoulder, she does not notice the
     letter from Ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from
     the room.


     INT. HALL

     Electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes.
     She is staring down the barrel of Rath's .22.

                             RATH
               Don't be stupid and you will live.

     The elevator behind Rath opens and closes against a hotel
     lobby ashtray.  He waves her into the elevator with his
     gun.

                             RATH
               Hurry.


     EXT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY

     Electra's black CAR ROARS out of the garage, onto the open
     street.


     INT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY

     The door swings open.  From the hall we can hear the
     familiar BEEPING of the COMPUTER GAME.  The room, 1014, is
     the same as Electra had left it when she ran out.

     Jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of Ken's
     letter.


     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR

     Electra drives, obviously nervous, as Rath watches out the
     rear window.

                             RATH
               Turn here.

     No one follows.  He turns back to her.

                             RATH
               How many bodies were there?

     He checks his watch.

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               He has to clean up.  How many bodies
               were there?

                             ELECTRA
               Um, five.

                             RATH
               One hour per man.

     Rath sets the timer on his watch for five hours.


     INT. HYATT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Bain has returned to room 1414.  Wearing rubber gloves, he
     clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of
     rug cleaner.

     He picks up the phone for room service.

                              BAIN
               Hi.  This is room 1414 --

     Behind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the
     Japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet.  He is
     naked.

                             BAIN
               Yes, could you send up a pot of
               coffee and my friends are going to
               need some more towels.  Thanks.

     He hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large
     blood stains on the carpet.  He points the rug cleaner at
     the stain covering it with white foam.


     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR

     Rath sees the entrance for the expressway.

                             RATH
               Get on the expressway.

                             ELECTRA
               Where are we going?

     Rath glances back.

                             RATH
               Nowhere yet.

     Electra turns onto the highway and NIKITA HOWLS from the
     "travel kitty" in the back seat.

                             ELECTRA
               Nikita, hush.

     NIKITA wants out and HOWLS again.

                             ELECTRA
               She won't stop unless you let her
               out.

     Rath reaches back and opens the box.  Nikita springs into
     the front seat onto Rath's lap.

                             RATH
               Nikita?  She helped me find you.

                             ELECTRA
               What?  How did you know I had a cat?

                             RATH
               Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I
               guessed right.

                             ELECTRA
               Who the fuck are you?  Who do you
               work for?

                             RATH
               I work for the government.

                             ELECTRA
               Yeah?

     She studies his face, his eyes.

                             ELECTRA
               Bullshit.

                             RATH
               Yeah.

                             ELECTRA
               You're one of them, aren't you?  A
               fucking pro.

                             RATH
               I'm part of the game, just like you.

     Electra pounds the steering wheel.

                             ELECTRA
               Jesus!

     He reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag.

                             ELECTRA
               What do you think you're doing?

     Rath plucks out the bundles of money.

                             RATH
               Twenty large?  That's all?

                             ELECTRA
               What do you mean, 'that's all'?
               What in the hell do you know?

                             RATH
               The bonus on the contract for you
               was one million dollars.

     Electra seems ready to jump out of her skin.  The
     speedometer is floating around 90.

                             RATH
               Slow down.

     He pulls out the disks.

                             RATH
               I figure that means these are worth
               ten times that, maybe more.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten million --

                             RATH
               Now you understand why I'm here.

     Electra wants to scream.  The speedometer is climbing over
     100.

                             RATH
               I really think you should slow down.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     The room is immaculate; near the door, several over-sized
     suitcases line the wall.

     Bain is sitting at the desk.  His WALKMAN is on, MUSIC
     BLASTING, as he flips casually through the telephone
     directory.

     His finger eases down a column stopping at "Morgan
     Jennifer."

     There is a KNOCK at the door.

     He smiles and tears out the page.

     There is another, LOUDER KNOCK which Bain hears this time.
     He TURN OFF the WALKMAN and opens the door; a BELLBOY is
     waiting with a luggage cart.

                             BELLBOY
               Hello, sir.  Have you some luggage
               you need carried.

     Bain gives him a wink and a smile.

                             BAIN
               Indeed I do.


     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR - NIGHT

     The red "low fuel" light is on.

                             ELECTRA
               Now what?

                             RATH
               Turn off the engine.

     Electra twists the ignition and the CAR DIES.  Rath
     glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas
     station.

                             ELECTRA
               You want me to pump?

                             RATH
               No, stay in the car.  I want you to
               understand something.  If I intended
               to kill you, you would already be
               dead.

     Electra says nothing.

     He reaches over and takes the car keys.

     When he is out of the car, Electra slowly releases the
     strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think,
               breathe, think...

     Electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as Rath
     pumps the gas.  Her eyes flash down to her bag.

     Outside, Rath watches Electra through the windows.  She
     appears motionless.

     The electric gas counter races like a stop watch.

     In the car, Electra eases her hand into her bag.

     The tank full, Rath re-hangs the pump.  He walks around
     the car and heads for the station.

     Electra waits until his back is turned.  She pulls her
     tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire
     stripper.  Reaching under the dash, she yanks out a
     tangled handful of wire.

     She looks up; Rath is inside paying.

                             ELECTRA
               Come on, come on, it's a cake walk.

     Her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping,
     stripping, twisting.

     Rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking
     for him.  It takes only a second for him to realize what
     she is doing.

                             RATH
               Oh shit.

     He runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and
     strikes them; the BATTERY GRINDS.

                             ELECTRA
               Please, please.

     He is almost there when the ENGINE FIRES.  She stomps on
     the gas, ramming the shift into drive.

     TIRES SQUEALING, the car swerves forward as Rath slams
     into it.  He bounces backward, falling to the ground.

     The car fishtails away, accelerating as Rath rolls to one
     knee, his gun automatically in his hand.  He draws a bead,
     but, he does not shoot.

     With a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.

                             RATH
               Dammit.


     EXT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     Electra's car is parked out front.

     She unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT LOBBY

     Standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is
     Jennifer Morgan.  What she was hoping for is not there.
     She looks up and sees Electra.

                             JENNIFER
               Excuse me --

     Electra stops.

                             JENNIFER
               You live here, don't you?

     Electra nods.

                             JENNIFER
               I'm sorry, this may sound really
               weird, but my friend told me he
               slipped a letter under the door here
               and I was wondering if you happened
               to see it?

     Electra is in a daze, her hand moving into her pocket.

                             ELECTRA
               Letter?

                             JENNIFER
               Yeah.  He said he saw a woman with
               dark hair going into the building
               when he dropped it off.

                             ELECTRA
               No.  I don't have it.

     Electra's mouth opens and she backs away.  Jennifer is
     bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it.

                             JENNIFER
               I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to -- I'm
               sorry.

     She shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving Electra
     in the lobby.

     Electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to
     pocket.

     A worried expression tightens her face; the letter is
     gone.

     She opens the interior door, following Jennifer up the
     stairs.


     INT. STAIRCASE

     Electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the
     possibilities, filled with fear.

     By the time Electra reaches the top floor, Jennifer is
     entering her apartment.

     Electra hurries past Jennifer's door to her own.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Electra flies across the living room to the monitors.

     She clicks them on, putting on Jennifer's channel.

     On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking
     her phone messages.  One from her mother.

     Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifer's entire
     apartment is in front of her.

     On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the
     oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room.

     Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath.

     Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out.
     Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just
     been.

     Wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail that
     she had dropped on the table and sorts through it.

     Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference
     to Jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as though
     he knew she couldn't see him.

     He moves into a room, just as she moves out.

     Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is
     unable to turn away.

     Bain searches through a desk drawer, while Jennifer starts
     undressing for her bath.

     He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom.
     If Jennifer would turn around she would see him.

     Electra is about to run, to call out when --

     Something catches Bain's eye.

     He moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is
     looking straight up into the camera.

     He inches towards it, not sure what it is.  The fiber
     optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over
     the bed.

     Staring at it, he is looking right at Electra.

     Bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he
     moves close to the fish-eye lens.  Poking it with his
     finger, he realizes what it is.  A warped smile stretches
     across his face as he whispers --

                             BAIN (V.O.)
               Oh, you sick little bitch --

     Electra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of
     her.

     She rips entire drawers out of her dresser, dumping them
     into a suitcase, stuffing in anything that looks
     important.  She grabs Nikita in the "travel kitty."


     EXT. BACK PORCH

     The door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind
     her as --

     Bain turns from the back stairs.

     She leaps back inside as he whips out his GUN, PUMPING TWO
     HOLES in the door.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     She scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase,
     still clutching the "travel kitty," as --

     The back DOOR EXPLODES from its hinges, Bain charging,
     FIRING his GUN.

     BULLETS HISSING past her, Electra crashes through the
     front door into the hall.


     INT. HALL

     The stairs are at the far end.  She is only halfway,
     when --

     Rath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked.

     Electra drops to the floor as --

     Behind her, Bain barrels from the apartment.

     Rath FIRES.

     The wood DOOR SPLINTERS, BULLET HOLES surrounding Bain.
     Off balance, he lunges back into the apartment.

     Rath continues FIRING, grabbing hold of Electra.

     They run down the stairs.


     EXT. REAR STAIRCASE

     Bain leaps down the flights.


     EXT. ALLEY

     Bain rushes into the street, looking in every direction.
     They are gone.

                             BAIN
               Fuck me!


     EXT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT

     Somewhere in the city.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra and Rath enter the room together but they are both
     immediately alone.

     She walks across the room to a chair in the corner,
     curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into her
     lap.

     He sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of
     the room and sits.

     They watch each other.  Silence.

     Between then is the liquor cabinet.  Rath knows a good
     idea when he sees one.

                             RATH
               Want a drink?

     Her face is as expressionless as Nikita's.

     He pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down.
     Takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.

                             RATH
               Okay...

     He returns to his table with his drink.

                             RATH
               I'm not good at this sort of thing,
               but we don't have a lot of time, so
               I'll just go ahead and get started.
               First:  you.  I ask myself, 'What is
               she thinking?'

     Her body tightens, coils.

                             RATH
               Simple.  She's scared.  She's almost
               been killed twice and now she is
               alone in a room with a man that she
               believes is an... assassin.

     Another deep pull on the bourbon.

                             RATH
               Furthermore she was brought here not
               entirely on her own accord which
               only increases her fear and
               suspicion.  Thus, as long as she is
               afraid, her first, maybe her only
               thought will be escape.  Does that
               leave me any other option?

     He slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping
     out his gun.

                             RATH
               No.

     Crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it
     to her.  She looks at it.  Back at him.

     He puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks
     to the bar.

     She picks up the gun.

                             RATH
               The gun is silenced.  She could
               shoot me right now.

     She stands, Nikita jumping from her lap.

                             RATH
               She could take the car and be far
               from here before the maid comes in
               the morning, but --

     She starts squeezing OFF ROUNDS; the LAMP EXPLODES, the
     CHAIRS around him ERUPT, tufts of white stuffing leaping
     into the air.

                             ELECTRA
               Shut up!

     He freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.

                             ELECTRA
               Stop trying to tell me what I'm
               thinking!

     She moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.

                             ELECTRA
               I'll tell you what you're thinking
               -- you think I'm not going to shoot
               you but right now you're not so
               sure, are you?

     A slight shake of the head, no.

                             ELECTRA
               You're thinking that maybe it was a
               mistake to give me this gun, that
               maybe I'm not going to think about
               things logically because I'm a woman
               and I'm freaked out and I'm going to
               do something impulsive and
               irrational -- right?

     She FIRES the GUN to both sides of his head.  He's
     surprised to be alive.

                             ELECTRA
               You don't know shit about me!  Now
               sit down!

     He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression
     she had worn sitting a moment ago.

     She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles
     of liquor.  She sucks it all down and throws the bottle
     across the room.

     Grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay.  How did you find me?

                             RATH
               You're the computer hacker, you tell
               me.

                             ELECTRA
               You didn't know anything about me.

     Nikita rubs up against her leg.

                             ELECTRA
               Nikita?

                             RATH
               Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian.
               There aren't that many.

     She nods, slurping at her bottle.

                             ELECTRA
               You're one of them, aren't you?

                             RATH
               'Them'?

                             ELECTRA
               An assassin?

                             RATH
               Until a minute ago.

                             ELECTRA
               What does that mean?

                             RATH
               If I still was what I used to be,
               you would not be pointing that at
               me.

     Electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now.

                             ELECTRA
               Who is that other guy?

                             RATH
               Another contractor.

                             ELECTRA
               Someone hired both of you?

                             RATH
               No.  They hired Bain.  The contract
               would have been mine, but Bain took
               it from me as he took the previous
               one.

                             ELECTRA
               So this is something between you and
               him?

                             RATH
               He stole the contract knowing that
               I would come after him.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because he is trying to retire me.

                             ELECTRA
               He wants to kill you?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               The nature of the business.  You
               remove your competition.

                             ELECTRA
               And you want to use me to get him?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Forget it!

                             RATH
               We don't have a choice.

     She FIRES the GUN, pocking the wall behind him.

                             ELECTRA
               Don't tell me I don't have a choice!

                             RATH
               Right.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm two seconds away from making my
               choice which means you've got two
               seconds to tell me why I shouldn't
               shoot you.

                             RATH
               It's simple.  You need me.  I need
               you.  And we will both need money.

                             ELECTRA
               I don't need you to get the money --
               my money!

                             RATH
               If it hadn't been for me, you would
               be dead.

     She's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that.

                             ELECTRA
               I don't need the money.

                             RATH
               This is something that is never
               going to end.  You can never work in
               the business again with this
               contract, because he will find you.
               To survive, you have to go into deep
               hiding.  And that's going to take
               money, a lot of money.

                             ELECTRA
               Then you can have the disks and I'll
               just walk out that door --

                             RATH
               If you walk out that door, Bain will
               still come after you.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because he took a contract on you.
               He'll come for you and he'll find
               you.

                             ELECTRA
               You don't know that -- you're trying
               to scare me.
     
                             RATH
               No.  It's the truth.  I know what
               you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're
               a ghost, you're not part of the real
               world.  You don't have a social
               security number.  You don't pay
               taxes.  You've probably used ten
               different names over the last ten
               years.  A long time ago something
               probably happened, something illegal
               and you ran, you disappeared and it
               was easy.  You think you can do it
               again.  But I'm telling you, fading
               from the law is nothing.  No matter
               what you do, where you go, I swear
               to you that Bain will find you.

                             ELECTRA
               How?

                             RATH
               Right now, as we sit here, he is
               tearing through your apartment.  He
               is digging through your drawers,
               emptying your closets.  He will take
               your telephone and address books,
               your appointment books.  If you keep
               a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go
               into the kitchen and find out what
               kind of food you eat, liquor you
               drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the
               bathroom he will find any
               prescription drugs you take and
               where you get them filled.  If you
               have video tape or recordings he
               will watch and listen to all of
               them.

     She is coming unglued.  Imagining him watching her tapes,
     going through her possessions.  She is moving, pacing,
     ready to explode.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh Jesus Jesus...

                             RATH
               He will know everything about you.
               Everything.  I know, because I've
               done it.  Once you've been inside a
               mark's home, you're in their head.
               If you're any good, you'll find the
               mark in a week, and Bain is good
               because I was the best and I
               couldn't take him.

     She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it
     everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in
     WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD.

     When she stops, he starts to say something but she levels
     the gun at him.

                             ELECTRA
               Shut up!  All right!  You've said
               enough!

     She forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample
     bottles.

                             ELECTRA
               I need to think... To be alone.

     With the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following
     at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the
     door.


     INT. BATHROOM

     She locks the door and then collapses.  Her body seems to
     fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall; the GUN
     and the BOTTLES falling from her arms, CLATTERING SOFTLY
     on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands.


     INT. BEDROOM

     Very mechanically, Rath begins setting up his chess board,
     putting the pieces into the same positions.  It is a
     ritual, and with it he enters a kind of trance.

     From the bathroom, almost inaudible, he hears Electra
     CRYING.


     INT. BATHROOM

     With her head now buried in her arms and knees, she is
     sobbing, her body rocking.  The crying seems very similar
     to Jennifer's; a complete emotional release.


     INT. BEDROOM

     Rath stares at the board.  The CRYING grows LOUDER.  He
     stands and walks to the door.  He starts to knock but
     stops himself.

     Like Electra with Jennifer, Rath would like to help, he
     just has no idea how to.  He turns back to the desk, to
     his chess game.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Her eyes are now burning red.  She stops crying long
     enough to suck down an entire sample of Scotch.  Nikita
     rubs against her and she strokes her.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh shit, Nikita.


     INT. BEDROOM

     Rath is setting up his computer system.  He hears the TUB
     FILLING UP.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking.

                             ELECTRA
               Cheers.

     Electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor
     where we see that many of the bottles are now empty.

     In the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out a
     wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the
     water.


     INT. BEDROOM

     When Electra comes out of the bathroom, Rath is again at
     his chess game.  She sits down across from him and sets
     the gun on the table between them.

     Rath looks up at her.

                             ELECTRA
               Listen -- I don't even know your
               name.

                             RATH
               Rath.  Robert Rath.

                             ELECTRA
               Electra.

                             RATH
               Just Electra?

                             ELECTRA
               Yeah.

                             RATH
               As in daughter of Agamemnon?

                             ELECTRA
               No.  Just Electra.

     The conversation dies.

                             ELECTRA
               What I'm trying to say is that --
               I'm not sure I can do this, help
               you, unless I know more about you.

                             RATH
               What do you want to know?

                             ELECTRA
               If Bain hadn't taken the contract on
               me, would you have?

     He stares at her.

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because I'm done.

                             ELECTRA
               This is crazy.  I can't trust you.
               You can't trust me.  How can we
               possibly help each other?

     They sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying
     between them.

                             RATH
               Do you play?

     She looks at the chess board.

                             ELECTRA
               With computers.

                             RATH
               It's not the same, is it?

                             ELECTRA
               Better than playing with yourself.

     He smiles.

                             RATH
               I had an opponent.

     She understands that he is trying to tell her something.

                             ELECTRA
               Had?

                             RATH
               He was Russian.  Nicholai
               Tachlinkov.  A legend in the
               business when I was just starting.
               I admired him.  When I heard he
               loved chess I became obsessed with
               the game.

     Electra studies the board.

                             ELECTRA
               He was white?

     Rath nods.

                             ELECTRA
               It looks like white's game.

                             RATH
               We played with a code using The New
               York Times obituaries.  Over three
               years we played twelve matches.  I
               never won.

                             ELECTRA
               Why didn't you finish this game?

     She reaches over and lifts a White Knight and takes a
     Bishop.  Rath counters, taking her Knight.

                             RATH
               He was... taken.

                             ELECTRA
               He was killed.

     Rath nods.

     Throughout the entire conversation they continue to play
     out the chess game.

                             ELECTRA
               By who?

     A long beat.

                             RATH
               I killed him.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because that's how it works.  That's
               what it's about.  He was the best.
               He was on top.

                             ELECTRA
               Where you wanted to be?

                             RATH
               Yes.  As soon as you get into this
               business, all you can think about is
               getting to the top.  That's all
               there is.  Until then, there is
               nothing.  You are nothing.

                             ELECTRA
               How did you get into the business?

                             RATH
               The same way everyone does; the
               government, the Agency.

                             ELECTRA
               The C.I.A.?

                             RATH
               More or less.

                             ELECTRA
               How old were you?

                             RATH
               They recruited me when I was in high
               school.

                             ELECTRA
               Jesus -- why?

                             RATH
               Languages.  I was already fluent in
               nine languages.

                             ELECTRA
               You were like a boy genius?

                             RATH
               Some people said that.  I never
               thought so.

                             ELECTRA
               Why not?

                             RATH
               I was just different.

                             ELECTRA
               You went from high school to the
               Agency?

                             RATH
               No.  I graduated from George
               Washington University.  Then I
               entered the Agency training program.

                             ELECTRA
               They didn't give you a choice, did
               they?

                             RATH
               No, they didn't.

                             ELECTRA
               But you knew what they were training
               you for?

                             RATH
               Of course.  I was going to be James
               Bond.

                             ELECTRA
               Ahhhh...

                             RATH
               They are very good at what they do.
               It's very seductive.  The training,
               the weapons, the travel --

                             ELECTRA
               The exotic women.

                             RATH
               Women?  No... not really.

                             ELECTRA
               Why not?

                             RATH
               Women... I don't... I don't want to
               talk about women.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because you are a women.

                             ELECTRA
               Why did you leave the Agency?

                             RATH
               The same reason everyone does.  You
               hear your name on C-SPAN and you
               realize you're a skeleton in
               someone's closet and they're coming
               to bury you.

                             ELECTRA
               They tried to kill you?

                             RATH
               Yes.  It didn't matter much to them
               as long as I disappeared.

                             ELECTRA
               Then you went freelance?

                             RATH
               The only thing different about the
               private sector is that a General
               Contractor takes less of a
               percentage than the government, so
               you make more money.  Then once you
               make the transition, you realize you
               were never working for the
               government; it was always the
               private sector, the vested interests
               and it's the same vested interests
               that continue to buy your plane
               tickets.

                             ELECTRA
               Tell me about the first time.

                             RATH
               My first take?

                             ELECTRA
               Yes.

                             RATH
               Why?

                             ELECTRA
               Because I want to know.

                             RATH
               It was... mechanical.  Very precise.
               It was exactly like the training
               drill except for the adrenaline.

                             ELECTRA
               Are they usually like that?

                             RATH
               No.  Just the first one.

                             ELECTRA
               After that?

                             RATH
               They become complicated... messy.

                             ELECTRA
               Did it ever bother you?

                             RATH
               Did it ever bother James Bond?

                             ELECTRA
               That's fiction.

                             RATH
               This is fiction!  Don't you see
               that?  This is another reality.  And
               the people that come into the world
               to play this game -- nobody forces
               them!  They're here, they know the
               rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do
               you understand what I am saying?  No
               one is innocent -- including you!

                             ELECTRA
               Does that mean it didn't bother you?

     Rath leans back and stares at her.  She waits.

                             RATH
               You get a job swinging a hammer, the
               first day you get a blister, it
               tears open, it bleeds and it stays
               sore a long time.  You keep swinging
               the hammer, you get a good hard
               callous that covers that spot and it
               never bothers you again.

     Electra says nothing.  He leans forward and slides a rook
     into her back row.

                             RATH
               Check.

     He leans back.

                             RATH
               Is that what you wanted to hear?
               Something cold blooded... something
               remorseless...

                             ELECTRA
               No.  Something honest.

     A beat.  Rath likes this woman.

     She moves her Queen.

                             ELECTRA
               Mate.

     He smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               I hope your plan is better than your
               game.


     INT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT

     The room is ugly.  Shag carpeting, wood paneling and
     polyester patterned curtains.

     We hear a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKING away as we MOVE
     ACROSS a table.  The hotel phone is in a modem, which is
     held together with duct tape.  Between the modem and the
     computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of
     naked circuit boards.

     It is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been
     put together with a fraction of the resources.

     Bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  Beside
     the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of
     Doritos and his Gameboy.

     On the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel
     is his cleaned gun.

     Bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks down
     his beer.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Where have you been, Michael?

     He belches.

     He is communicating with his General Contractor.

     On the table is a collection of personal objects, much of
     it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from Electra's house.

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               Tracking the mark.

     Bain fingers a pair of satin panties.  He smiles as he
     smells them.

                             BAIN
               I'm on the scent.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               You're too late.

     Bain slams his beer down.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I've learned from MicroCell, Rath
               fulfilled the contract.

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               How?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               He took out the mark and sold the
               disks back to MicroCell.

     Bain falls back in his chair, thinking.  He runs his hands
     through his sweaty hair.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Michael?

                             BAIN
               No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               They money will be standard bank
               transfer.  We believe we will know
               where and when.

                             BAIN
               What?

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               How?

     There is no response.

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               How in the fuck do you know that?

     A long beat.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Such language in front of a lady.

                             BAIN
               I don't give a fuck what you are.  I
               asked you --

     He hits the repeat key.

                             BAIN
                       (types)
               How in the fuck do you know that?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Do you want Rath or not?

     Bain stares at the screen, thinking.  Thinking hard.


     INT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Another computer screen, but we don't know that it is
     different.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               It will take three days to arrange
               the transfer.

                             ELECTRA
               Three days?

     We are in Electra and Rath's hotel room.  She is standing
     behind him, reading as he types.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Which account?

                             ELECTRA
               Are you going to tell him?

                             RATH
               It.  Tell it.  For all I know it
               could be a machine.

                             ELECTRA
               You said you didn't trust it.

                             RATH
               I don't.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Which account?

                             ELECTRA
               What kind of bank is going to allow
               us to withdraw ten million dollars
               the day it is transferred?

                             RATH
               The kind preferred by drug
               smugglers, arms dealers and
               politicians.

     Rath types in an account number.

                             RATH
               Do you have a passport?

                             ELECTRA
               Several.

                             RATH
               Good.

                             ELECTRA
               Where is it?

                             RATH
               Mexico.


     INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

     Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section,
     which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping
     champagne.

                             ELECTRA
               God, I love first class.  I remember
               when I was a little girl, I would
               wonder what it was like up here.  I
               would always try to peek through the
               curtains.

     Rath says nothing, staring out the window.

     Electra shakes her head.

                             ELECTRA
               I hope Nikita's all right.

     He still does not respond.

                             ELECTRA
               Hey, where are you?

                             RATH
               Thinking.

                             ELECTRA
               About?

                             RATH
               Nothing.

     Electra sips the last of her champagne.

                             ELECTRA
               I've never been to the Gulf of
               Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?

                             RATH
               I don't know.

                             ELECTRA
               You were there?

     A long beat.

                             RATH
               Yes.


     EXT. SMALL MEXICAN AIRPORT - DAY

     The plane lands.


     EXT. TERMINAL CAB STAND

     Rath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them
     in his trunk.


     INT. CAB

     Rath speaks perfect Spanish.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               Good afternoon.  We have
               reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in
               Costa Blanca.

                             CABBY
                       (in Spanish)
               Yes, sir.
     

     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

     The cab pulls up in front of a large, brand new glass
     hotel, which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the
     gulf water.

     Rath is upset.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.

                             CABBY
                       (in Spanish)
               Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the
               city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.

                             CABBY
                       (in Spanish)
               I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there
               was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso.
               This is the new Hotel Paraiso.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               Take us there.


     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - DAY

     American tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but
     much of the out-lying city is very poor.

     The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk.  The
     face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang
     in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of
     the building rather than the building itself.

     Rath stares at it, remembering.

     Electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza
     del Sol.

     He looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly
     opposite of that.

     The International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful
     old building; its exterior walls are white-washed
     concrete, blindingly bright white.

     Electra looks at the bank and smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               So, that's where all that S & L
               money is?

     Rath is not listening to her.  He is somewhere else.  He
     turns back to the fourth story window.

                             RATH
               That's where he'll be.

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               I wasn't expecting this.  I need to
               think.


     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - NIGHT

     Beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to
     midnight oil.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ELEVATOR

     On one side of the elevator is a young couple who look
     like newlyweds.  They are cuddling, kissing and giggling
     as though they are alone.

     Electra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator.
     It is a strange contrast.

     Electra is staring at them.

     Rath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world.

     The ELEVATOR CHIMES and opens.

     Nobody moves.

     The DOORS CHIME again and start to close, as everyone
     realizes that this is their floor.

     Rath and the other man grab the doors, which spring back
     open.

     It is a funny, awkward moment, as everyone apologizes and
     smiles politely, on the way out.


     INT. HALL

     The couple move down the hall, the newlyweds finding their
     door first.

     Rath reaches the door to their room, opens it and enters.

     Electra lingers, watching the other couple, watching as he
     fumbles for his keys, her hand running up between his legs
     and over his ass.

     He finally manages to open the door and she pushes him
     inside.

     Electra softly closes her door.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HOTEL ROOM

     Rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding
     balcony doors at the dark gulf water.

                             ELECTRA
               Did you see them?

     Electra moves about the large suite.

                             ELECTRA
               They looked like they were in love.

     Rath says nothing.

                             ELECTRA
               Well, I think I'll take a bath.
               Come on, Nikita!

     The two of them walk into the bathroom, leaving Rath to
     himself.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub, water
     running through her fingers as she adjusts the
     temperature.

     After a beat she hears a SMALL CRASH, a GLASS BREAKING.
     It is followed by other MUFFLED NOISES, a WOMAN GIGGLING
     and a THUMPING.  The sounds are coming from the other side
     of the tub wall, from the other suite.  Electra puts her
     ear against the tile to listen.

     The WATER FILLING her TUB is too loud for her to hear.
     She turns it OFF.

     There is more BUMPING and THUMPING, the WOMAN LAUGHING and
     then, the LAUGHS SHORTEN into SOFT WHIMPERS.

     Electra hangs on each sound, slowly lifted by it, moving
     up toward the over-head fan and ducts.

     The SOUNDS get LOUDER as she moves closer to the vents,
     until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub,
     listening to what is clearly the sounds of TWO PEOPLE
     MAKING LOVE.

     Their MOANS and SHRIEKS CLIMAX and Electra smiles.


     INT. BEDROOM

     It is dark now.  A single desk light is on, under which
     Rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in
     their familiar pattern.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom.  She seems very clean
     and fresh, wearing a long white T-shirt and thin robe.

                             ELECTRA
               That felt great.  You should try it.

     She watches him setting the pieces onto the board.

                             ELECTRA
               Don't you ever get tired of playing
               the same game?

     He looks at her.

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               Why not?

                             RATH
               It helps me to focus.  It centers
               me, helps me think.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh.  What do you think about?

                             RATH
               Work.  The things I need to get
               done.

     She sits across from him looking at the board.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you think about the game?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               But you've never figured out a way
               to win.

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               Not even a stalemate?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               What happens if you do?

     This strikes Rath as a very strange question and he is
     suddenly annoyed by her.

                             ELECTRA
               Can I ask you something?

     He knows she will anyway.

                             ELECTRA
               What will you do if this works, if
               we get the money?

                             RATH
               I don't know... maybe I'll live on a
               boat, sail to all the places I've
               never been.

                             ELECTRA
               That sounds nice.

     He finishes his glass of bourbon.

     She is not sure what to say next, if she should say
     anything at all.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like
               to try and get some sleep.

                             RATH
               You can have the bed.  The chair is
               fine for me.

     He pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from
     the ice bucket.

                             ELECTRA
               Thanks.

     She slips out of the robe and in between the sheets.

     Rath sits across the room, his back to her.

     She tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you think he's here?

                             RATH
               Here?

                             ELECTRA
               In Costa Blanca.

                             RATH
               Yes.

     She thinks.

                             ELECTRA
               What do you think he's doing?

                             RATH
               I don't know... But I'm sure he's
               not sleeping.

     She pulls the covers tightly to her chin.  Her eyes do not
     close.


     INT. HOTEL (COSTA BLANCA) - NIGHT

     A small hotel in the city, away from the beaches, built
     before there was such a thing as central air conditioning.

     Bain is naked, except for a small pair of camouflage
     jockeys and his Walkman strapped to his shoulder.  His
     head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in
     his ears.

     He is tearing open a long box wrapped in "Happy Birthday"
     paper.

     Inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle.
     He smiles.

     He assembles it quickly, snapping it together with
     automatic ease.  When the sight is tightened in place, he
     jumps up.

     In the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the
     gun.

     Not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself
     again.  He starts moving with the music, playing with the
     gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning
     it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  The gun zips
     and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes.

     The butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the
     scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.  He is
     sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move.

                             BAIN
               You're dead, motherfucker.


     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

     Electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the
     warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea.

     Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame.

                             RATH
               Breakfast.

                             ELECTRA
               Why don't you bring it out here?
               It's beautiful out here.

     Rath steps a little farther out.  He looks down either
     side of the building, checking sight lines.  He looks out
     and sees another hotel with windows facing them.

     He turns to her.  Says nothing.  Moves back inside.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     The breakfast trays are empty.  Rath is sipping coffee,
     scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach.

     He stops working.

                             ELECTRA
               I know what you are thinking.  I'm
               not going to disappear, okay?  I'm
               not going anywhere, just down there,
               to that beautiful beach.  I got to
               get out of this room, just for a
               little while.

                             RATH
               Okay.

                             ELECTRA
               Really?

                             RATH
               He won't be looking for you.  Just
               be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your
               sunglasses on.

                             ELECTRA
               Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.


     INT. HOTEL HALL

     Electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach.
     At the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get
     on the elevator.  She starts to call to them to hold it
     for her, but she stops herself.

     The elevator closes.

     She edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door
     to their suite.  She touches it with the tips of her
     fingers.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Rath is still at the table.

     The curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing
     through the open patio door.  They swell open and fall.
     It seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in
     the changing shape of the curtain.

     Rath stands.  He walks to the open door.  Standing in the
     frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below.

     He slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still.


     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - DAY

     Bain moves through the market, booths lining the edges of
     the plaza.  His eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses.

     He buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the
     plaza.

     He looks at the bank, at the military-style security
     guards that patrol the front.

     He turns in the plaza, checking the perimeter, his gaze
     falling on the tall, burned-out building.

     He looks back at the bank, imagining the sight line.

     He bites into the apricot, its juice gushing, running down
     his chin.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Rath is leaning back in the bed, NIKITA PURRING in his
     lap.

     He did not sleep last night and is very tired.  His eyes
     fight to stay open.

     The sound of the TELEVISION momentarily hangs in the hotel
     room as he sleeps.  The program is a SPANISH DUBBED
     version of GOLDFINGER.

     The door bangs open and Rath springs off the bed, a gun
     flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking
     Electra.

     Rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the GUN CLICK
     back into place.

                             RATH
               You should knock.

                             ELECTRA
               Sorry.

                             RATH
               How was the beach?

                             ELECTRA
               The beach?  It was nice.

     She smiles.


     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DUSK

     The sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows
     of the hotel.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall.
     In her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is
     looking over the top of, staring intensely across the
     room.

     We can hear Rath, his breathing deep and even.  He is
     doing Tai Chi, wearing only his boxer shorts.  His body is
     coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he
     moves fluidly through space.

     Electra begins to breath with him.

     She moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to
     meet his.

     He empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, his
     eyes closed, rested.

                             ELECTRA
               That was beautiful.

     He looks at her.

                             ELECTRA
               Tai Chi, right?

     He nods.

                             ELECTRA
               Where did you learn it?

                             RATH
               Taiwan.

                             ELECTRA
               Not that I would know, but you look
               like you're really good at it.

                             RATH
               Thank you.

                             ELECTRA
               I've always wanted to learn
               something like that.

                             RATH
               You should.  It's very important,
               that the body release the energy
               that builds in it.

     Electra nods, watching him bend, reaching for a change of
     clothes.

                             RATH
               I'm going to shower.  If you're
               hungry, go ahead and order some
               dinner.

     Electra nods again.


     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT

     Bain is doing push ups.  He is naked except for his
     camouflage bikinis.

     He has his feet up on a chair, making it harder, the dip
     deeper.

     His body is gushing sweat, his face a burning red.

     He is like a piston firing up and down.  The muscles in
     his neck and shoulders are bulging cords.

     Slowly, his arm begin to tire, the strain seen in his
     knotting and twisting expression.

     Half way up, he collapses, feet falling off the chair.

     He rolls onto his back, rubbing a tricep.  It hurts.  He
     licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

     Rath checks his watch.  It's after eight o'clock.  He
     lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem.

                             RATH
               I'm going to call.

     Electra drops her book and climbs off the bed.

     He dials, types the code and waits.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Hello, Robert.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               The contract?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Paid in full.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh, my God.  Ten million dollars.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Transferred to the specified
               account.

     Rath stares at the screen.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Goodbye, Robert.

     Rath disconnects.  The PHONE HUMS.

     Electra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle.

                             RATH
               Sit down.

     She does.

     He opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens
     and two small mikes that look like hearing aids.

                             RATH
               Okay --

     He starts drawing several squares on the paper, as Electra
     picks up the mike.  She looks over it, frowns.

                             ELECTRA
               Two way?

                             RATH
               Transmits and receives.

                             ELECTRA
               Cheap as shit.

     He looks at her.

                             RATH
               I paid a lot for these.

                             ELECTRA
               They saw you coming a mile away.  If
               I had known we'd be using --

                             RATH
               It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have
               to deal with these.

                             ELECTRA
               Fine.

     He goes back to his drawing.

                             RATH
               This is the bank.  This is the
               hotel.  In the morning I will enter
               the bank.

                             ELECTRA
               Check.

                             RATH
               He will be hidden somewhere out
               here, probably somewhere low, in the
               crowd.  He'll stay there until he
               sees me enter the bank.

                             ELECTRA
               But he won't shoot you right then?

                             RATH
               No.  It would be amateur.  A risk.
               He'll wait for the prime shot, that
               he knows is coming.  Once I'm
               inside, he'll move to the hotel.
               He'll go up the back, too much
               traffic in the front.

     He draws another square.

                             RATH
               You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A
               public place far enough away that he
               won't notice you, but with a good
               enough view you'll be able to see
               him when he moves inside.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay.  Then what?

                             RATH
               Then, we wait.

                             ELECTRA
               Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know
               if I like this plan.

                             RATH
               It will take the entire day, but he
               will begin to doubt himself.  He
               will begin to believe that he missed
               me, that somehow I slipped by and am
               already on a plane to Europe.

     He describes this as though remembering it.

                             RATH
               The sun will be low, almost dark,
               the air cool and the bank will
               almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He
               will put the rifle down, he will get
               up and he will walk across the plaza
               to the bank.

                             ELECTRA
               Why won't he wait until the bank
               closes?

                             RATH
               He won't be able to.  He'll have to
               go inside.  He'll have to see with
               his own eyes, whether or not I am
               there.  If the bank closes, he won't
               know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm
               sure.  And when he does you'll go
               into the hotel, go upstairs and take
               the gun.

                             ELECTRA
               What?  What if he brings it with
               him?

     He shakes his head.

                             RATH
               He can't.  The bank has an expensive
               security system; metal detectors and
               X-ray machines.

                             ELECTRA
               That means you won't have a gun.

                             RATH
               That's right.

                             ELECTRA
               And with the mikes, I'll tell you
               when he leaves the hotel and you'll
               tell me when he leaves the bank.

                             RATH
               If things go well, I don't have to.
               You'll already be in a rented car
               waiting for me.

                             ELECTRA
               You'll have the money.  How do I
               know that you won't --

                             RATH
               I'll be walking out of the bank,
               unarmed.  You'll have the gun and
               I'll drive the car.

                             ELECTRA
               We split the money?

                             RATH
               Five million apiece.  You get on
               your plane, I get on mine.

                             ELECTRA
               Sounds pretty well figured out.

                             RATH
               I've been thinking about it for a
               long time.

                             ELECTRA
               Except --

                             RATH
               What?

                             ELECTRA
               Except, if he doesn't come out of
               the hotel.

                             RATH
               I told you, he will.

                             ELECTRA
               You can't know for sure, how can
               you?  I mean, you're not him.

                             RATH
               I was.

     She waits for him to explain.

                             RATH
               Ten years ago, I sat there in that
               same hotel window, sweat pouring off
               of me waiting --

                             ELECTRA
               For Nicholai?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               You killed him here?  In this city,
               outside that bank?

     Rath nods.

                             ELECTRA
               What is it?  I don't like this at
               all.  What is going on here?

                             RATH
               I don't know.  It just happened.  I
               was here ten years ago, I'm here
               now.  That's it.

                             ELECTRA
               I don't believe that.

                             RATH
               It wasn't planned or premeditated.
               I swear.  Things happened beyond my
               control.  I understood; I saw where
               they were leading and I suppose that
               it just made sense.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten years ago.

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               What happened?

                             RATH
               I waited until I was insane and then
               I walked into the bank.  He was
               sitting there, very calm, waiting
               for me.

                             ELECTRA
               What did he want?

                             RATH
               He wanted what I want now; to get
               out of the business.  To disappear
               to some empty Greek island.

                             RATH
               What did he say?

                             RATH
               He said I couldn't win.  That no one
               wins at this game.

                             ELECTRA
               Was that it?

                             RATH
               Then he offered me one million
               dollars to walk away, to quit the
               business.

                             ELECTRA
               You didn't take it.

                             RATH
               No.  I went back to the hotel.  And
               waited.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten years later, here you are again.

                             RATH
               Yes.  Here I am again.


     POV - THROUGH TELESCOPIC LENS - MARBLE STATUE

     The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight are lined-up on the
     head of a marble statue.


     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT

     Bain is laying on the floor in the dark.  The rifle is
     under him as he aims out of his balcony, down the street
     at the statue.

     He looks up from the scope, checking the street.  It is
     dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight.

     His finger squeezes, the GUN ALMOST SILENT, as --

     INTERCUT WITH:

     STATUE

     A chunk of STONE EXPLODES out the head of the statue.
     Again, the GUN SPITS and another cloud of dust and ROCK
     BURSTS from the head.  His finger is pumping the trigger,
     until the head cracks and falls.

     He's laughing, hysterical, looking down the street at the
     headless statue.

     He rolls onto his side still laughing.  Then, suddenly, he
     stops, staring up at the stars in the night sky.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

     Electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, in
     another world.

     Rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her.

                             ELECTRA
               This has been the longest day of my
               life.

     Rath nods, pouring himself a drink.  Electra looks at the
     drink, downs the whole glass.  He refills it.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you have ulcers?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               I think I got one today.

                             RATH
               Five million dollars will buy a lot
               of Rolaids.

     She smiles.  They both gulp down their drinks and he fills
     them again.

                             ELECTRA
               What do you suppose he's doing now?

     Rath shrugs.  He is no longer looking at her; staring at
     the board, moving his mind into the chess game.

     She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the
     way a child does, almost imitating him.  She does not want
     to be left alone right now.

     She reaches over and moves a white knight.

     He blinks.  His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities.

     He picks a bishop and counters.

     After another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes
     his knight.

                             RATH
               Why did you trade a bishop for a
               knight?

                             ELECTRA
               I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I
               like knights.

                             RATH
               They're worth less points.

                             ELECTRA
               So?

     There is no point in arguing.

     As they continue to play, we begin to hear in the
     distance, the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very
     vigorous LOVE.

     Electra watches Rath to see if he hears them.  He shows no
     sign of it, concentrating on the game.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you hear them?

     He looks up.

                             ELECTRA
               Listen.

     He hears it.  Not interested.

                             ELECTRA
               Did you think they were newlyweds?

                             RATH
               I didn't notice them.

                             ELECTRA
               When I first saw them I thought they
               were married.

                             RATH
               How do you know they're not?

                             ELECTRA
               I went into their room this
               afternoon.

                             RATH
               What?

                             ELECTRA
               It was no big deal.  I saw them
               leave, I went in.

                             RATH
               Jesus, if someone had --

                             ELECTRA
               Nobody ever sees me.   

                             RATH
               Why in the hell would you take that
               chance?

                             ELECTRA
               I heard them last night and it made
               me want to know something about
               them.  I wanted to, so I did.

     Rath shakes his head.  In the b.g., the WOMAN is ALMOST
     SCREAMING.

                             ELECTRA
               She is married, but not to him.
               Another man, much older.  She has
               four kids.  The young guy works for
               her.  And I think she likes kinky
               sex.

                             RATH
               Thank you.

                             ELECTRA
               Isn't it interesting though?  I
               mean, look at us, in this room.  Or
               yesterday, when we were walking in
               the plaza market.  I mean, we look
               like just another couple.  But what
               are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               No?

                             RATH
               It's always been that way.  The
               world has always functioned on two
               levels.

                             ELECTRA
               I know.  It makes me crazy.

                             RATH
               Why?

                             ELECTRA
               I don't know.  When I was in
               college, I was forced to go to a
               psychiatrist because I was caught
               drilling holes in my dorm room
               floor.

                             RATH
               And you were drilling these
               holes...?

                             ELECTRA
               So I could watch the girl that lived
               under me.

                             RATH
               Apparently this doctor was unable to
               cure you.

                             ELECTRA
               He told me that my curiosity became
               unnaturally entangled with my sense
               of self-preservation.

                             RATH
               Did he explain how this happened?

                             ELECTRA
               He believed it all went back to one
               night, when as a little girl.  I
               watched my parents have this big
               fight, really big.  I thought my
               mother was going to kill my father.
               Then they went into their room and
               made up.  And I watched them make
               love through the keyhole.

     The WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX.

     Electra moves her queen, taking his other knight.

                             RATH
               What are you doing?

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               That's a ridiculous move.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because, I'll take it.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm playing white, remember.  You
               can't tell me which pieces to move.
               It doesn't work that way.

     He shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing.

                             ELECTRA
               Can I ask you something?

                             RATH
               I'm sure you will.

                             ELECTRA
               Am I attractive?

     This gets his attention.

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Are you attracted to me?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Why?  I don't know.

                             ELECTRA
               Is it a physical thing, or a mental
               thing?

                             RATH
               Both.

     A good answer.  Electra smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               Is that why you didn't want to talk
               about women before?

                             RATH
               I didn't want to complicate the
               situation.

                             ELECTRA
               Attraction is a complication?

                             RATH
               It can be.

                             ELECTRA
               It happened to you before?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Who was she?

                             RATH
               Someone like me, like you.  A pro.

                             ELECTRA
               What happened to her?

                             RATH
               She was taken.

                             ELECTRA
               Did you --

                             RATH
               No.  I tried to stop it.  I
               couldn't.

                             ELECTRA
               Was she the only one?

                             RATH
               After her, I realized that to
               survive I had to live without...
               It's dangerous to let things become
               complicated.

                             ELECTRA
               Is this becoming complicated?

                             RATH
               I'm not sure that I care anymore.

     He looks up from the game.

                             ELECTRA
               Were you attracted to me right away?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               When did it start?

                             RATH
               Honestly?

                             ELECTRA
               Uh-huh.

                             RATH
               When I gave you my gun and you
               almost shot me.

                             ELECTRA
               Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

                             RATH
               Why?

                             ELECTRA
               That doesn't sound normal.

                             RATH
               I'm not normal.

                             ELECTRA
               I know.  That's why I'm attracted to
               you.  I mean, you make me nervous.
               You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my
               curiosity/self-preservation thing,
               but all I can really think about
               right now is kissing you.

     They rise up from the table, together, knocking over the
     chess game.  The pieces fall to the floor.

     They grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry,
     aggressive.  They tear at each other's clothes and at
     their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as
     they become naked in front of each other.  There is
     nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very
     real.

     He takes her, lifting her onto the table.

     She scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out
     of the way.

     She opens her legs and he moves in between them.

                             ELECTRA
               I wanted to tell you --

     Her breath rushes out, then back in.

                             ELECTRA
               My real name is Anna.

     He smiles.

                             RATH
               Martin.

                             ELECTRA
               Martin.

     Her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into
     her.

                             ELECTRA
               Nice to meet you, Martin.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HALL - NIGHT

     Outside of the room, we can hear the MUFFLED SOUNDS of TWO
     PEOPLE MAKING LOVE.


     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - NIGHT

     We are MOVING DOWN the street, LOW, OVER the old
     flagstones, TOWARDS the marble statue that Bain shot.

     On the ground are the shattered pieces of the head.

     CLOSER

     We see one of the pieces is part of the face, the eyes,
     which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king.

     CLOSER

     We MOVE INTO the blank white of that eye.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     WHITE SQUARE GLOSSED WITH LIGHT

     We PULL BACK, RISING UP and AWAY, and see other squares,
     black and white like a chess board.

     A woman's HIGH HEELS CLICK past.

     RISING HIGHER, we see the woman walking.  A man crosses
     behind her, in another direction.

     HIGHER STILL, and we realize that we are looking at the
     black and white marble floor of the --


     INT. INTERNATIONAL BANCO DE MEXICO - DAY

     It is a strange and beautiful bank.

     The ceilings are vast, the suspended lights elaborate,
     baroque, the enormous clock on the wall, built to resemble
     a sun.

     It looks almost as though it could be a museum, with its
     massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important
     Mexican figures.

     Already it is crowded, people and security guards moving
     about beneath us.

     Rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers.


     EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE

     The cafe is off the plaza.

     Electra sits at a patio table.  Down the street she can
     see the back of the burned-out hotel.

     She hears Rath in her ear-piece.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               All right.  I'm in the bank.  He'll
               move now.  How are you doing?

     She is nervous.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm ready.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               Good.

     Rath is wearing a well-tailored, gray silk suit and dark
     sunglasses.  In his hand is a very large briefcase.  He
     crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows.

                             TELLER
               May I help you?

                             RATH
               Yes.  Could you check on a transfer
               for me?

                             TELLER
               Your name, or account?

                             RATH
               Rath.  Robert Rath.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra smiles when she hears him, mouthing the name
     "Martin."


     INT. BANK

     A BANK OFFICIAL walks over to the window, carrying a
     printed receipt, with a very bright smile.

                             OFFICIAL
               Senor Rath, we have received your
               transfer.

     He hands Rath the receipt.  He glances at it, checking the
     zeros.  There are seven of them.

                             RATH
               Good.  Now I'll need to close this
               account.  I'd like you to ready the
               paperwork.

     The smile fades.

                             OFFICIAL
               You wish to close this account
               today?

                             RATH
               That's correct.

                             OFFICIAL
               How would you like the funds?

                             RATH
               American currency.

                             OFFICIAL
               This will take some time.

                             RATH
               I have all day.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra looks up over her book and Bain is there, moving
     down the side street, gliding through the crowd with the
     menacing indifference of a shark.


     INT. BANK

     The Official is talking to the teller in Spanish, when
     Electra whispers in Rath's ear.

                             ELECTRA
               He's here.

     Rath freezes.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall,
     covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out
     of the burned hotel.  He is carrying a long nylon duffel
     bag.

     At the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled
     loose and Bain squeezes through, into the hotel.

                             ELECTRA
               He's inside.


     INT. BANK

     Rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs
     set in pairs along the wall of the bank.

     He glances at the enormous clock, which reads 10:10.  He
     checks his Rolex.

                             RATH
               Now, we wait.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL PARAISO

     The center of the hotel is open.  Interior hall balconies,
     which line each floor, look down onto an old atrium
     courtyard.  The fire did the most damage here, spreading
     easily throughout the entire building.

     The skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area, has
     been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing
     broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened
     floors and walls.

     Bain enters, and carefully begins climbing the charred
     staircase to the fifth floor.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     The room has been heavily burned, stained black from
     smoke.  The charred carpet crunches and cracks, as Bain
     walks across it to the window.

     As he nears the exterior wall, several FLOOR BOARDS BREAK
     with a brittle SNAP and he almost falls through.

                             BAIN
               Shit.

     He pulls his leg free.

     Outside the window, across the plaza, he sees the bank; a
     perfect site.

     Quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun.

     He grabs a magazine and snaps it into place.

     He aims down at the bank's bright white stairs.  A man is
     walking down the steps and Bain finds the center of his
     forehead in the cross-hairs of the scope.

     Bain makes a gun noise, followed by the sound of a head
     bursting open.

     He giggles.

     Leaning against the wall, in the shadows of the window,
     the gun in his lap, he waits.

     Time slows to a crawl.

     Without taking his eye from the bank, Bain rummages
     through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes.  He pulls
     one out with his lips and lights it.

     Taking a deep drag, he lets the smoke slowly leak out and
     drift up into the night.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     SUN

     White hot.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     There are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened
     window sill, where Bain extinguishes another.

                             BAIN
               What in the fuck are you doing in
               there?

     The room is hot, a streak of sweat up his back and front.
     It is difficult to breathe.

     A man walks out of the bank, wearing a suit similar to
     Rath's.  Bain's body snaps erect, rifle instantly leveled.

     He sights the man's head, his finger tightening on the
     trigger, but he is not sure it is Rath.

     He looks over the scope, looks back.  The man reaches the
     bottom of the stairs.  Bain's body sags.

                             BAIN
               That's not him.  Jesus, Bain, baby,
               chill the fuck out.

     He takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his
     forehead, leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood.

     He again fumbles through his bag, finding a container of
     bottled water.  He chugs the whole thing.


     INT. BANK

     The Official walks over to Rath with a number of papers to
     sign.

                             OFFICIAL
               Your signature, senor.  Everything
               is ready.

     Rath signs them, but does not get up.

                             OFFICIAL
               Excellent, senor.  If you could
               follow me?

                             RATH
               I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an
               associate.  Can you hold everything
               for me until he arrives?

                             OFFICIAL
               Of course, senor.

                             RATH
               Thank you.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought
     of all that money.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten million dollars, sitting there.
               Waiting... this is insane.


     INT. BANK

     There is a faint smile on Rath's lips.


     EXT. PLAZA

     The shadows are getting longer.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     Bain is rocking back and forth, breathing through his
     teeth.  He has to urinate.  Bad.

     He is checking every face that comes out of the bank with
     the scope.  Still nothing.

                             BAIN
               This is fucking insane.

     He grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and
     begins refilling it.

     A man in a suit appears on the steps and Bain fumbles the
     bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun.  It is not Rath.

                             BAIN
               Fucking God dammit!

     He hurls the bottle of piss across the room.


     INT. BANK

     The sun clock on the wall, perfectly still, reads 5:20.
     After a long beat a single minute clicks off.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     The sun is getting low.  The room much darker now.

     Bain sits at the window; his body a knot.

     A large group of tourists flow out of the bank and Bain's
     eyes light up.  One by one, the scope passes over each
     face.

     They trickle down the steps and into the plaza.

     The stairs are again empty.

     Bain screams, pounding the butt of the gun down, splitting
     open the floor.

     He looks at the bank.  Nothing.  He checks his watch.  In
     fifteen minutes the bank will close.

     He stands up.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain
     emerges from the shadows.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh my God.

     He is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don't
     get out of his way.

                             ELECTRA
               He's coming.


     INT. BANK

     Rath looks up at the clock, smiles.

                             RATH
               Four minutes.

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               I waited another four minutes.

                             ELECTRA
               Shit.

                             RATH
               Wait until he is on the stairs.

                             ELECTRA
               Right.

                             RATH
               I'm taking off my mike.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay.

                             RATH
               Electra --

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               Last night --


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               Was nice.

                             RATH
               Yes.

     She sees Bain storming up the stairs.  She stands, tosses
     several bills on the table and leaves.


     INT. BANK

     Bain charges into the bank, tearing off his sunglasses,
     scanning the room.  His face is a twisted grimace,
     streaked with black charcoal.  His body and clothes are
     covered in sweat and large salt rings.  His breathing
     labored.

     He sees Rath sitting comfortably, calm, his suit not even
     wrinkled and realizes that Rath has been waiting for him.

     His first instinct is to turn and run, but he stops
     himself.  He is confused, unsure.

     Then, as though understanding he has no choice, he puts
     his sunglasses back on and strides over to Rath, BOOTS
     CLICKING against the polished MARBLE.

     Bain sits down in the leather chair across from him.

                             BAIN
               How'd you know?  Just tell me that.
               How'd you fucking know?

                             RATH
               I knew the same way in ten years
               you're going to know.

                             BAIN
               What does that fucking mean?

                             RATH
               It means that I'm going to tell you
               things, even though I already know
               that you're not going to listen to a
               God damned thing I say.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor, then
     navigates around a large hole, towards the last room.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               It's irony.  That's what it is.  But
               the real irony is that you won't
               know it's irony until you're sitting
               over here.

     Bain isn't listening.  Instead he's watching, everyone who
     walks near them.

                             RATH
               When you walked in here and you saw
               me, sitting here, waiting; the first
               thing that went through your head
               was that you were a dead man.

     This catches Bain's ear.

                             RATH
               You're thinking that you've been
               sold out.  That's the only way I
               could know you were out there.  Why
               would you think this?  Because you
               don't trust your contractor.  You
               don't trust anyone.  It's automatic.
               It's the first and last commandment.
               It's the only thing that keeps you
               alive.  So, try as I might to tell
               you the truth, you can't believe me.
               Do you see the irony of the
               situation?  It's kind of funny,
               isn't it?

     Bain is not laughing.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     Inside the burned out closet, Electra finds Bain's nylon
     duffel bag.

     Digging through it, she finds his Gameboy, his Walkman,
     his .22, ammunition clips and several issues of Soldier of
     Fortune and a Punisher comic book.

     The rifle is not here.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago,
               you contacted your contractor, who
               told you that they knew when and
               where I was going to pick up the
               transferred money from MicroCell.
               You don't know how they got the
               information.  It bothered you, but
               you didn't care.  How do I know
               this?  Because ten years ago, I was
               sitting in that chair, as scared
               shitless as you are now.

                             BAIN
               I ain't scared of you.

                             RATH
               Yeah you are and you hate it.  You
               hate the fact that your hand is
               shaking and mine isn't.  That you're
               sweating your balls off and I'm not.
               You've got fear and hate in your
               belly like battery acid, all because
               of me.

                             BAIN
               If you think you can take me, quit
               fucking bullshitting and try it.

                             RATH
               All right, Bain.  Pay attention,
               because this is where everything
               changes.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is beginning to panic.  She cannot find the gun
     and has started looking in other rooms.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               You're a businessman, right?  This
               is a business deal.  Behind that
               counter, I have over ten million
               dollars.  I'll give you half of it,
               more money than you'll make in the
               next ten years if, you walk away.

     Bain's face changes, muscles relaxing, the tension
     slipping out of him.

                             BAIN
               Five million dollars?

                             RATH
               That's right.

                             BAIN
               Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.

     Bain is smiling.

                             RATH
               Did you see how I did that?  Magic
               wasn't it?

                             BAIN
               What?

                             RATH
               You understand what's going on?  It
               makes sense, right?

                             BAIN
               Oh, yeah.

                             RATH
               What I just said, no assassin would
               say.  What I've said, only a mark
               would say.

     They stare at each other.

                             BAIN
               You think I would be an idiot to
               pass up five million dollars.

                             RATH
               You would be.

                             BAIN
               You don't know a fucking thing about
               me.  You don't have the slightest
               fucking clue.

                             RATH
               Why don't you tell me.

                             BAIN
               I'll tell you this.  After
               Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to
               be alive.  But now, here, I just
               realized that you were the lucky
               one.

                             RATH
               Now I'll tell you something.  It
               wouldn't fucking matter if I offered
               you one hundred million dollars.
               You'd still be thinking the same
               thing, that you're going to take me.
               And here I am, sitting through this,
               knowing it's bullshit, looking at
               you and the only thing going on in
               my mind, the only thing I can think
               is that, in just a few minutes I'm
               going to take you.

     Bain jumps out of the seat.

                             BAIN
               Yeah, okay!  I'm ready!  Let's
               fucking go!

     He's walking, turning, watching everything, everyone.
     He's out the door.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is on the fourth level, searching desperately for
     the gun, rushing through the black skeletal remains of the
     hotel.

     In her ear she hears Rath.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               Electra?

     She shrieks.


     INT. BANK

     Rath is at the counter, as the Official loads perfectly
     stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the
     case.

                             RATH
               Electra?


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is frantic.

                             ELECTRA
               God, I can't find it!  I can't find
               it!  I can't find the fucking gun!


     INT. BANK

     For Rath, everything has changed.


     EXT. PLAZA

     In long, pounding strides, Bain crosses the square,
     twisting, glancing back, watching.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra nears the room below the fifth story window.

                             ELECTRA
               It wasn't with his other stuff!


     INT. BANK

     Rath is now afraid.

                             RATH
               Electra, get out.


     EXT. SIDE STREET

     Bain nears the opening in the plywood wall.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black
     plumbing pipe and charred lathe.  It hangs in the space
     between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!

                             ELECTRA
               Oh, God.  I see it!

     She reaches for it, but it's too high.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               Electra, listen!  You have got to
               come to the bank for the money!  The
               money!

     She is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back
     toward the stairs.

     Just as she grabs the rail, she hears BAIN STORMING INTO
     THE LOBBY below.

     She begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly.

     Bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs.


     INT. BANK

     The bank is almost empty.  Rath has begun to sweat.

                             RATH
               Electra!

     The Official looks at him strangely, stacking the last of
     the green paper blocks.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra peeks over the rail to see Bain right behind her.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               Electra!

     The voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off,
     stuffing it in her pocket.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               Electra, what's happening?  What are
               you --

     The Official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut.

                             OFFICIAL
               Finido, senor.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra turns into the hotel room just as Bain reaches the
     fifth floor.  There is no time.
     
     She slips into the closet, as Bain whips around the corner
     into the room.  He rushes to the window, slamming himself
     against it.

                             BAIN
               You're gonna take me?  Come on!
               Come on, motherfucker!

     He bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls
     out the assault rifle.

                             BAIN
               Take this!  Take this, you fuck!

     Electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood
     lathe.

     He pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through
     the wall.

                             BAIN
               Motherfucker!

     He stands suddenly, perfectly still, gun aimed at the
     bank.

                             BAIN
               Comeon-comeon-comeone-it'sover-
               gameover-comeon.


     INT. BANK

     The sun clock reads six o'clock.

     There is no one left in the bank except for employees and
     guards.

     The Official is at Rath's elbow leading him towards the
     metal gates.

                             OFFICIAL
               We are closed, senor.  Thank you for
               banking with us.

     It is happening as it happened ten years ago.  Rath knows
     that he is unable to stop it.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain is rigid, cast in iron, the rifle rammed under his
     chin, sight tight to his eye, finger wrapped around the
     trigger.

     Electra silently, ever so delicately opens her bag,
     lifting out her gun.

                             BAIN
               Make me shit, you sorry ass piece of
               mark meat!  Come on, come on.  It's
               over!  I know it!  You know it!  We
               know it!

     In the...


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     we watch Rath step out of the bank, the doors closing
     behind him.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Bain smiles.


     INSIDE CLOSET

     Electra slowly rises, still watching Bain.


     EXT. PLAZA

     The sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep
     orange and auburn cast.

     Rath looks down at the descending, white, stone steps.

     He steps down to the first stair.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

                             BAIN
               Lift your head, motherfucker.

     Electra is standing.  The gun clenched in her shaking
     hand.

                             BAIN
               Look up here.


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     The cross-hairs are an "X" on Rath's head.


     BACK TO SCENE

                             BAIN
               Look up.  Look at me.  I want to see
               your face.


     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath looks across the square, up the side of the hotel, at
     the window; there is only black shadow.

     He knows it is over.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

                             BAIN
               Yes.

     Electra shoves open the door, leveling the gun --

     As Bain turns.

                             BAIN
               Wha --

     She FIRES.

     His shoulder explodes, blood spraying the black wall.


     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath hears BAIN SCREAM.

                             RATH
               Electra.

     His eyes, his whole body comes to life.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain is twisting in mid-air, diving as --

     She FIRES again, moving at him.  A chunk of WOOD EXPLODES
     as she misses.

     He falls, the burned FLOOR SHATTERING, charred JOISTS
     SHEARING with the sound of BREAKING GLASS.

     She watches him fall through, hears him HIT the FLOOR
     below, ASH and WOOD CLATTERING around him.

     The gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but
     he is gone.


     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath races wildly across the darkening market square.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her FOOTSTEPS.

                             BAIN
               Die, bitch!

     He FIRES, finger pumping, BULLETS ERUPTING through the
     floor around her feet.

     Screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall.

     His shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and
     rises, listening as --

     She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall.

     Beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the
     staircase, waiting, until --

     Electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that
     they are exposed.

     She flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is
     PERFORATED with BULLETS.

                             BAIN
               Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you
               doing?  I don't believe this is
               happening!

     She can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the
     hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall,
     above; there is nowhere to go.

                             BAIN
               You're dead!  You're fucking dead!
               I'm going to kill you a hundred
               fucking times for this!

     Bain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through
     the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves
     he'll know her position.

     He FIRES another.

     Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at
     the floor.

     Another SHOT.

     She FIRES back.

     Bain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS,
     flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets.

     Her gun empties first.

     He laughs hearing the CLICK.

                             BAIN
               Game over, bitch!

                             RATH
               Bain!

     Rath's scream ECHOES up through the building.

     Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a
     ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light
     from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and
     broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream-
     like grid resembling a chess board.

     Electra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing
     the gun over the balcony.

     The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she
     races back to the room.

                             BAIN
               Fuck no!

     Rath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to
     the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun
     is empty.

                             RATH
               Shit!

     Bain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to
     the end of the hall.

     Rath sees it all happening.

                             RATH
               Electra!

     Bain snaps into a targeting stance.

     Electra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly
     touching the floor --


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     When the cross-hairs find her back.


     BACK TO SCENE

                             RATH
               Electra!

     Time becomes syrup.

                             RATH
               Down!  Get down!

     Bain FIRES.

     Electra dives.

     The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her.

     She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room.

     Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the
     stairs.

     Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and
     FIRES, the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back
     down into the shadows.

     Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22.

     Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door.

     Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out
     the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the
     ground and bursts open.

     A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest
     in the middle of the courtyard.

     Rath and Bain both see it.

     Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it.

     Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then
     back at the door.  Something's got to give.

     Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between
     her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door.

     Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502.

     Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a
     slow breath and tears from the shadows --

     Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip,
     the ground a blur beneath him --

     Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath.

     Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip
     as --

     The RIFLE SPITS --

     Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood.


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     The scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Rath rams the clip in place.

                             BAIN
               Game --

     Bain squeezes the trigger --

     CLICK -- the rifle is empty.  Bain screams in disbelief.

     Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the
     balcony but Bain is gone.

     Electra searches the room for a way out.  Keeping the gun
     trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole
     that Bain fell through.

     Grimacing, Rath struggles to his feet.

                             RATH
               Electra!

     Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster
     flying.

     Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN,
     swallowing her.

     Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH.

     Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the
     open ceiling.

                             RATH
               The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid
               of it!  Throw it!

     She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared.  She
     looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands.

     His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall.

     Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to
     the fourth level through another burned opening.

     Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at
     every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain,
     a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her.

     Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the
     door to room 502.

     Hearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he
     snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls.

     Rath hears her scream.

     Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her
     to the ground.

     She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face,
     jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious.

     Bain grabs the gun.

     Rath whips into the room BLASTING --

     BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened
     hole.

     Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead.
     Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared
     with blood.

     From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               Hey!  Tell me something, Bobby-boy.

     Electra comes to, her eyes blinking open.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               Are you still thinking that you're
               going to take me?

     Electra is trying to focus, as Rath listens to the voice,
     searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from
     everywhere.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               No, I don't think you are.  You know
               what I think?

     The voice is closer.  Rath wipes the stinging sweat from
     his eyes.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               I think you're thinking what I'm
               thinking.

     Still dizzy, Electra taps her fist against Rath's chest.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               You know what I'm thinking,
               Bobby-boy?!

     It seems as though Bain is in the room.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               You know what I'm thinking?!

     Electra opens her fist and inside Rath sees the handful of
     bullets from the other gun.

     Bain whirls INTO VIEW, his gun whipping around to Rath who
     turns too slow.

     Bain pumps the trigger.  ONE CLICK.  ANOTHER.  And
     ANOTHER.  The gun is empty.

                             RATH
               Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

     He levels his gun.

                             RATH
               Game over.

     Rath FIRES, OVER and OVER, emptying the GUN into Bain's
     head and chest, even as he crashes through the balcony
     railing and falls, twisting through lightless space,
     slamming to the stone floor dead.


     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - NIGHT

     The sun is gone, the market is closing, the crowd drifting
     from the plaza.

     A man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley
     beside the boarded hotel.  Although they walk a bit slow,
     leaning on one another, they become it seems, like just
     another couple, arm in arm, holding tightly to each other
     and to a very large suitcase.

                                                 FADE OUT.

                              THE END
ASSASSINS

     FADE IN:

     PERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK

     We know that we are looking at something because its
     polished surface shimmers with light.

     PULLING BACK, other squares are revealed; the black and
     white tiles of a chess board.

     The board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find
     ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board, MOVING THROUGH a chess
     game.

     The pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other
     pieces.  It has reached that critical moment when pieces
     are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies
     unravel towards a final outcome.

     Standing above the pieces around him, we see the black
     king.

     We MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face, CLOSER TO his chiseled
     ebony features, CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold
     black eyes...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK

     The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens.

     Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-
     less marsh.  It is fall, the first frost not far away and
     the foliage is brown and bare.  With the red-orange ball
     of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first
     appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
     mire.

     The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man.
     He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  A .22 caliber
     gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand.

     His name is ROBERT RATH.

     The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.  He is also wearing a
     very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
     brambles and mud.

     As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the
     mud.

                             KETCHAM
               Aw-shit!

     He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in
     the air.  He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud.
     He looks at Rath.

                             KETCHAM
               How much farther?

                             RATH
               Just a little ways.  Up to those
               trees.

     About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
     is a small cluster of trees.

                             KETCHAM
               Oh, fuck it.

     He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud.
     He smiles.  It feels good.  He hurls the sock.  Lifting
     his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  He
     grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off,
     laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud.

     Rath waits, a faint smile.

     He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
     both feet into the dark, wet earth.

                             KETCHAM
               Hey, this feels kinda good.

     They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet
     deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE.

                             KETCHAM
               Hey, do you mind if I talk a
               little?  I feel like, I don't
               know, talking I guess.

                             RATH
               Sure.

                             KETCHAM
               Funny, I've never been a talker.
               My wife was always getting on me
               about that.  'Say what you feel,
               tell me what's bothering you,
               you ve got to talk to me.'  I
               never would though.  Not really.

                               RATH
               Why not?

                               KETCHAM
               I don't know.  Part of me wanted
               to but part of me always said,
               'What's she going to be able to
               do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I
               didn't trust her.

     He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
     snowball.

                             KETCHAM
               My Margaret... I loved her but you
               know what?  I cheated on her.  All
               the time.  I don't even know why.
               It wasn't the sex, Margaret was
               great in bed.  I think if I wasn't
               married I wouldn't have even looked
               at some of those women.  I knew she
               couldn't trust me, so how could I
               trust her?  If she was here right
               now I'd think that I would tell her
               that I was sorry... 'course, if she
               were here right now, maybe I
               wouldn't feel like talking.

     He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are
     too far.

                             KETCHAM
               I think I've heard of you.

                             RATH
               It's possible.

                             KETCHAM
               You're pretty famous aren't you?

                             RATH
               I hope not.

                             KETCHAM
               I know this may seem like a strange
               question, but can I ask you how
               much the contract was for -- not
               to insult you or anything, I know
               you're a professional, but just
               for me, I was just wondering.

                             RATH
               It's a common question.

                             KETCHAM
               Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to
               see that price tag.  Like art,
               right?  You hang some painting
               that looks like baby-puke in your
               living room only if it costs a
               bundle.

                             RATH
               A dime.

                             KETCHAM
               One hundred thousand?  That's it?
               Jesus... Is that a lot?

                             RATH
               Average.

                             KETCHAM
               Shit... oh well.

     Ketcham laughs.

                             KETCHAM
               I have been thinking about this
               for a long while.  I knew this day
               was coming.  I knew someday
               someone would make the call on me.
               I never thought about anyone that
               I had whacked.  What do you call
               it anyway?

                             RATH
               Taken.

                             KETCHAM
               'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had
               someone taken I would call our
               General Contractor, transfer the
               money and as soon as I hung up the
               phone I forgot about them.

                             RATH
               Everyone who plays the game knows
               the rules.

                             KETCHAM
               That's exactly what I told myself.

     Ketcham laughs again.  He is getting kind of giggly, like
     he's high.

                             KETCHAM
               I always wondered what I'd be
               thinking at this exact moment.  I
               imagined that I would be thinking
               about the fucker who contracted
               this, trying to figure out who
               it was...

     Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.

                             RATH
               Don't know.  That's how it works.

                             KETCHAM
               That's what our General Contractor
               told us but how can you trust
               someone like that?

                             RATH
               Right.

                             KETCHAM
               I thought that I would be thinking
               about Margaret, or work, or that
               I'd be having these deep, profound
               and depressing thoughts but I'm
               not.  I'm trying to think really
               profound thoughts, but I can't.
               It seems very funny to me.

                             RATH
               What are you thinking about?

                             KETCHAM
               I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't
               that funny?  I haven't had a
               Moonpie since I was ten years old.
               Right now, I'm thinking how much
               I'd love one.

                             RATH
               And an R.C.

     He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him.  Ketcham suddenly
     stops laughing.  They are nearly to the cluster of trees.

                             KETCHAM
               Can I ask you something?

                             RATH
               Go ahead.

                             KETCHAM
               What do other guys do?

     He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.

                             RATH
               Everyone handles it differently.
               Some are ready, some are not.

                             KETCHAM
               Do they get down on their knees,
               begging and crying?

                             RATH
               Some.

                             KETCHAM
               When I thought about this, that
               was always there, in the back of
               my head, that image of me on my
               knees, crying.  It wouldn't go
               away and it would really upset me.
               It was something that I could never
               get away from... but now, I feel
               it's okay.  I feel good.

                             RATH
               Can I ask you a question?

                             KETCHAM
               Anything.

                             RATH
               Why didn't you fade?

                              KETCHAM
               You mean quit?

                              RATH
               Yeah.

                              KETCHAM
               I used to think about it.  I had
               Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I
               thought about moving somewhere
               far away like, Europe.  I could
               see all of that, the first part,
               the getting away but I couldn't
               see that next part.  'Then what?'
               So I'd stop thinking about it and
               go back to work.  You understand?

                             RATH
               Yeah.

     Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
     trees.

                             KETCHAM
               I always pictured that I would end
               in some land fill, under
               someone else's garbage.  I kept
               picturing those plastic diapers
               filled with some baby's green shit,
               covering me.  But this is nice...

     He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black
     horizon.

                               KETCHAM
               Look at that.  I haven't watched
               the sun set in a million years.
               Do you mind?

                             RATH
               No.

     Ketcham stares at the last of the light.

                             KETCHAM
               Nice... real nice.

     With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry.

     Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.  Rath
     looks down at the gun limply held in his hand.

     When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark-
     ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY
     FALLING INTO THE MUD.  After a beat we hear TWO MORE
     SHOTS.

     Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud,
     a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
     left by the dying sun.

     Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand-
     ing alone in the middle of nowhere.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     The room is dark and still.

     A man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the
     amber wash of urban light.

     Snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the
     city's electric night.

     The man finishes his bourbon, ICE CLINKING in the empty
     glass.  He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until
     his forehead rests against the window.

     In the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath.

     Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for
     Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the
     distant street below.

     He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself
     fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door.

     Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the
     bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed
     her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see
     that her dress is very short and very tight.

                             ESCORT (WOMAN)
               Hi.  Did you call --

                             RATH
               Yes.  Please come in.

     Her HIGH HEELS TAP against the tile foyer as she enters
     and he takes her coat.

                             ESCORT
               Goodness, it's so dark...

     She reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.

                             RATH
               I prefer it like this.

                             ESCORT
               How can a beautiful man like you
               be shy?

     He smiles.

                             RATH
               I prefer it, that's all.

     She moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her
     body radiating like heat.

                             ESCORT
               It's okay, honey.  We can do it
               anyway you want.

     Rath is obviously uncomfortable.

                             RATH
               Would you like a drink?

                             ESCORT
               I'd love one.  Whatever you're
               having.

     They move into the room, from a distance, as featureless
     as two shadows.

     She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a
     city night.

                             ESCORT
               Beautiful.

     He hands her the drink.  Her smile is bright and perfect.

                             ESCORT
               Good will towards men.

     Their glasses clink as he drains half his drink.  If she
     drinks at all, we can not tell.

                             RATH
               Why are you working today?

                             ESCORT
               Holidays are our busiest days.  No
               one likes to be alone on holidays.
               I know I don't.

     She touches his face, the caress and her expression of
     tenderness seemingly genuine.

                             RATH
               You're very good at this aren't
               you?

                             ESCORT
               I think you're supposed to answer
               that question.

     Her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any
     farther Rath turns away, returning to the bar.

                             RATH
               I know what you expect, but I
               don't want...

     He pours himself another drink.

                             ESCORT
               That's okay, hon, I always expect
               the unexpected.

                             RATH
               I called because I just want... I
               need to talk.

     She sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she
     becomes a listener.

                             RATH
               I've been thinking about my life,
               about things I have done... What I
               do for a living is in some ways
               similiar to what you do.

     He sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened
     by the alcohol.

                             RATH
               I know that everything has a
               price.  I want you to understand
               that I'm willing to pay.

     He takes out an envelope and puts it between them.  She
     picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred
     dollar bills.

                             ESCORT
               For what?

                             RATH
               Honesty.

     She puts the envelope down.

                             RATH
               I just want to ask you some
               questions.

     Uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for
     the right words.

                             RATH
               Do you ever regret things you've
               done?

                             ESCORT
               Everyone regrets something.

                             RATH
               But when you finLsh a job,
               afterwards do you think about
               them?

                             ESCORT
               Sometimes.

                             RATH
               Do you think about their wives or
               their families?

                             ESCORT
               No.  They call me, I don't call
               them.  If they didn't call I
               wouldn't exist.

     Rath nods.  His next question is barely audible.

                             RATH
               Do you ever think about starting
               over?

                             ESCORT
               All the time.

                             RATH
               Can you tell me about it?

     For the first time we really see her take a drink.  She
     closes her eyes.

                             ESCORT
               Sometimes I dream that I meet a
               man, this good, honest man and we
               fall in love.  I imagine us living
               on a boat, reading books, sailing
               to places where no one knows who
               we were or cares what we did.

     She opens her eyes and looks at him.

                             RATH
               And what if you never meet that
               man?

     She smiles.

                             ESCORT
               Then, I'll sail alone.

                             RATH
               Do you believe that?

                             ESCORT
               Are you asking me if I believe in
               another life?

     Rath nods.

                             ESCORT
               I have to.

     She finishes her drink.

                             ESCORT
               Is that all you want?

                             RATH
               Yes.

     She picks up the money and stands.

                             RATH
               Thank you.

                             ESCORT
               Anytime.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     It is the same room but now it is very cluttered, room
     service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about.

     He has been here for a while.

     He is sitting at the table, staring intensely at a chess
     game; we see the board and all of the pieces set in the
     same positions as in the opening sequence.

     He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and
     then finishes off another bottle of bourbon.

     He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches
     over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a
     black rook.

     A sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving
     both the black and white pieces.  Suddenly he stops.  He
     gets up and shifts to the other side of the board,
     studying the game from white's perspective.

     Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through
     it as he moves around the table, returning to his place
     behind the black king.

     The games reaches its end as black is check-mated.

     He slumps down onto the table and looks across at the
     white king.

                             RATH
               Fuck you, Nick.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

     Rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer
     office; a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with
     cables winding through a scrambler and then into a fax
     machine and the latest high-powered lap-top computer.

     On the table near the desk, we see the .22, dismantled
     and cleaned, spread out on a white towel.

     He types in a complicated access code sequence, then
     waits, staring at the blank screen.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Where have you been, Robert?

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Sick.  The flu.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I don't believe you.

                             RATH
               I don't give a fuck --

                             RATH/SCREEN
               It's true.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I have been sitting on a contract
               from Cleveland for six days
               because of you.

                             RATH
               Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck
               your contracts --

                             RATH/SCREEN
               I need a rest.

                             CONTRACTOR/ SCREEN
               That's impossible, Robert.  You're
               at the top of your field.  These
               are the best contracts.  To stop
               now would be self-destructive.

     He looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on
     the table.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Send the file.  I'll have the
               estimate tonight.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I'm worried about you, Robert.

                             RATH
               You fucking should be --

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Don't be.

     On the screen the word "Transmitting" appears.  Rath
     slowly gets out of his chair.

     The FAX MACHINE CLICKS and HUXS to life as a photograph
     of a smiling, old Italian man curls onto the desk.

     Rath begins destroying the hotel room, smashing anything
     he can get his hands on.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

     Rath is in the middle of the room which he has
     demolished.  Having showered and shaved, he is now
     standing naked, in the midst of the rubble, practicing
     the slow and graceful art of Tai Chi.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Rath is working at the desk.  He is tallying numbers,
     materials, totaling his estimate.

     Spread out over the table are several faxed photos of
     the old Italian, Leevio Valli, usually surrounded by
     bodyguards.

     The file details Valli's life and his daily routine.  It
     includes:  phone bills, credit card and bank account
     statements, driver license and vehicle registration, the
     real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his
     income tax return.

     Satisfied with his figures, Rath plugs the phone into the
     modem and makes a call.

     The network comes on-line as the General Contractor
     types:

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               You're too late, Robert.

     Rath types.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               What?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               The contract was stolen.

     Rath stares at the screen.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Who?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               A new player.  He's using the name
               Nicholai.

     The name hits Rath and he sits, unable to breathe.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               You know what must be done.

     The screen goes black as the network shuts down.

     Rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts.  He lifts
     a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant
     appears every Friday.  The name of the restaurant has been
     circled in red pen by Rath:  "Trattoria Roma."


     EXT. TRATTORIA ROMA - NIGHT

     A red awning spans the entrance of a popular Italian
     restaurant.


     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     It is a large establishment with many tables and booths.
     The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian
     families who have been eating here for years.

     Rath is sitting alone at a booth.  With very subtle
     changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian.

     In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine.
     He touches neither of them.  His eyes shift as he studies
     the room.

     LEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five
     gorillas in Italian suits.  The owner hurries to greet
     them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian.

     The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over-
     sized booth in the back.

     Rath does not look twice at them.  Immediately he is
     watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin.

     Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit
     around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the
     room.

     A wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and
     fills their glasses.  A pretty waitress sets a steaming
     loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in
     front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles.
     They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back
     to the kitchen.

     At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their
     glasses.

     It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first
     to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is
     the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is
     BAIN.  He smiles.

     The goon reaches for his gun as --

     Bain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face.  He
     screams.

     Leevio coughs a spray of minestrone, as a GUN flashes free
     from the white linen towel hung over the steward's arm.

     It happens instantly.  FOUR SHOTS and the goons are dead.

     Leevio screams.

                             LEEVIO
               Don't!

     A FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT.

     Leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table.

     Bain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON
     from his belt expecting an attack.

     Facing the screaming crowd, he begins to SHOOT anyone who
     moves or stands, men or women.

     There is chaos in the restaurant.  People scream, falling
     to the ground, scrambling under tables.

     Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of
     the room to the other.

     The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who
     are sobbing.

     He moves through the room, watching, searching.

                             BAIN
               Don't anybody move.  You move,
               you're dead.

     He passes the table Rath was sitting at, but it is empty.

                             BAIN
               Come on, you chicken shit
               motherfucker.  I know you're here.
               Let's go.


     EXT. CONCRETE PARKING GARAGE

     Across the street from Trattoria Roma, Rath jacks together
     a German assault rifle with night scope.


     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     Bain looks out the window at the dark street.

     He turns and searches through the people huddled on the
     floor.  He aims his gun.

                             BAIN
               You!  Get up!

     A quivering wine steward stands.

     He points to another.

                             BAIN
               You, too!  Up!


     EXT. PARKING GARAGE

     THROUGH the NIGHT SCOPE we see the front door to the
     restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped
     together slowly back out.


     INT. TRATTORIA ROMA

     Bain is second from the end, both guns aimed at the
     stewards.

     One of them begins to cry.

                             BAIN
               Not yet.  Don't move or you're
               fucking dead.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath moves the scope back and forth, unable to pick out
     the assassin.

                             RATH
               Shit.  Just do them all.  All of
               them.  Shit.

     He can't pull the trigger.


     EXT. TRATTORIA STOREFRONT

     The group moves toward the street.

                             BAIN
               Now run!

     Like dogs out of the gate, they bolt.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath watches as they scatter, finding Bain in his scope.


     EXT. STREET

     A chunk of BRICK EXPLODES from the wall just behind Bain's
     head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the
     curb.  He laughs.  We get the idea that Bain is enjoying
     this.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath looks over his scope, talking to himself.  He is
     sweating.

                             RATH
               Shit.  What are you doing, old man?
               You're too fucking slow.

     He looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line
     of cars.

                              RATH
               Okay.  Which one?  Which one is
               yours?


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars,
     staying low and out of sight.

     He works his way up to a black Mercedes that is parked
     illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys.
     He hits the remote unlocking the doors.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope, almost obscured
     by the parked Mercedes.

                             RATH
               Amateur.

     He takes aim.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Just as Bain starts to open the door, the front TIRE
     EXPLODES.  Another second, the back TIRE EXPLODES.

                             BAIN
               Fuck!


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath waits, steely calm, his finger on the trigger.

                             RATH
               Your move.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain hears the growing wail of POLICE SIRENS.  Thinking
     for a moment, he opens the car door and pulls a long
     handled switchblade and a roll of electrician's tape from
     the glove compartment.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath sees the car light go on, but can't make out what
     Bain is doing.  The SIRENS are GETTING LOUDER.  There's a
     lot of them.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls
     his shirt sleeve down.  From his pocket he takes out a
     Gameboy and begins playing "Tetris."


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath watches as the police cars come racing down the
     street.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     The CARS SCREECH to a halt in front of the restaurant.
     The COPS jump out, drawing their weapons.

     Bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air.

                             BAIN
               Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I give
               up!

     More CARS come SCREECHING up as the two officers hold
     their beads on Bain.

                             COP
               Hit the ground!  Face down!  Spread
               your legs!

     Bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him,
     frisking him.  In this position the Cop is unable to find
     the knife strapped to Bain's forearm, but finds the
     Gameboy.

                             BAIN
               Hey, don't touch that!

                             COP
               Shut up!

     The Cop twists Bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing
     him tightly.

     They drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and
     paramedics in the street.


     INT. PARKING GARAGE

     Rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the
     police car, but is unable to get a clean shot.  Bain is
     using the cops for cover, keeping his head low.

                             RATH
               Son of a bitch.

     The Cops shove Bain into the back seat.

     Rath very quickly walks to his car, tossing his gun into
     the trunk.  He gets in and STARTS the ENGINE.


     INT. PATROL CAR

     The two Officers are outside the car talking with the
     sergeant.

     Bain, laying low beneath the windows, peeks up at the
     shadowy parking garage.  He smiles.

     The two Policemen get in the car, the second picking up
     the radio.  The driver GUNS the ENGINE and the black and
     white RUMBLES down the street.

                             COP #2
               This is 181, returning with suspect
               involved in multiple shooting at
               Trattoria Roma.  Repeat, en route
               with suspect.

     He hangs up the radio and looks back at Bain through the
     metal caging.

                             COP #2
               Jesus Christ, do you know who you
               shot in there?

     Bain almost laughs.

                             COP #2
               What are you?  Some kind of a
               hitman?

     Bain looks out the window.

                             COP #2
               You know what we call guys like you?

     Bain looks at him.

                             COP #2
               Sizzle lean.  They're gonna fry your
               ass.

     He laughs at his own joke, looking at his partner, who
     chuckles.


     EXT. CITY STREET

     Rath's car races down the street trying to catch up with
     the patrol car.


     INT. PATROL CAR

     Bain stares out the window, silent.

     Behind his back, he takes hold of his left thumb with his
     right hand.

     The Cop is playing with the Gameboy.

     With a quick jerk, he yanks the thumb out of its socket.
     His expression remains perfectly blank.

     The thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand.  The skin
     stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his
     wrist.

     The Cop turns as the SWITCHBLADE CLICKS and Bain sticks
     the knife through the wire mesh, into the cop's eye.  A
     font of blood arcs onto the windshield.

     Grabbing hold of the driver's shirt collar, Bain jabs the
     blade into the back of his neck.

     The driver screams trying to pull free of Bain's grip.

     He slams on the brakes, groping for his gun and the CAR
     SKIDS out of control.

     Bain stabs the Cop again, his GUN FIRING WILDLY as --

     The patrol car starts to flip and roll.


     INT. RATH'S CAR

     Rath turns as he hears an EXPLOSION, several blocks away.
     The TIRES SQUEAL as he makes a hard right.


     EXT. STREET

     Orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned
     patrol car.  Oil black clouds billow into the night sky.

     Rath's car cruises past.

     Rath sees the back seat window shattered, kicked out.

     Bain is gone.

                             RATH
               I'm not done yet.


     EXT. CITY STREET INTERSECTION

     A brand new cab is sitting at a red light.

     The cabby looks into the rearview mirror, as a pair of
     headlights roll up behind him.  The car gets closer, the
     lights brighter; they don't stop.

     He shrieks as the CAR SMASHES INTO HIS, TEARING OFF HIS
     BUMPER.

     The cabby jumps out, rattling off a string of obscenities.

     Rath gets out of the white car, starting to apologize, as
     the cabby moves toward him.

     When he's close enough, Rath decks him, knocking him
     unconscious.

     He picks him up and puts him in the white car.

     Rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to
     green, he drives off.


     INT. CAB

     Rath circles the area, turning up the cab's CB.

     A couple of CALLS CRACKLE through the speaker, before he
     hears what he's waiting for; an airport fare in this area.
     At the intersection of Adams and Nine.

     He picks up the mike.

                              RATH
               This is 1242.  I got it.


     EXT. ADAMS AND NINE

     It is a deserted intersection.  The buildings are dark and
     some of the street lights are out.

     The cab sits by itself, ENGINE RUNNING, its taillights
     glowing through the exhaust.


     INT. CAB

     Rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat.  His other
     hand grips the door handle.

     As he waits, watching the intersection, he notices the
     cabby's ID pinned to the dashboard.

     Leaving the gun in his jacket, he reaches for the ID card.

     He rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the
     seat, the door behind him opens.  Someone gets in and
     closes the door.  Rath peers into the rearview mirror.

     It is Bain.

     For the first time we realize that the front and back of
     the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass.

     There is an awkward silence as Rath sits, unsure.

     Bain looks at him.

                             BAIN
               Is there a problem?

                             RATH
               No.  No problem.  The airport,
               right?

                             BAIN
               Right.

     The cab pulls out of the intersection.


     INT. CAB

     Rath studies Bain.  There is a thin line of blood down his
     temple.  Bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his
     Gameboy, resuming his game of Tetris.

                             RATH
               How'd you cut yourself?

     Their voices are distorted through the small electric
     amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal
     money exchanger.

     Bain touches the blood on his forehead, looking at it a
     bit surprised.

                             BAIN
               Oh?  Working.  A little accident.

     He wipes it off as best he can.

                             RATH
               You a waiter?  You look like a
               waiter.

     Bain is uninterested.

                             BAIN
               Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.

                             RATH
               Where?

                             BAIN
               What?

                             RATH
               What restaurant?

                             BAIN
               Uh, Fontella's

                             RATH
               So you're from around here?

                             BAIN
               No.  No I'm not.

     Bain is getting agitated.

                             RATH
               Where you from?

                             BAIN
               What is this?

                             RATH
               Not too good at small talk, eh?

                             BAIN
               Look, I'm real tired and I'm not
               interested in fucking chit-chat.

                             RATH
               I know just what you mean.  I'm
               pretty beat myself.

     Silence.

                             RATH
               Since you looked like a waiter, I
               had to ask what restaurant because
               of what happened at the Trattoria
               Roma.

     Bain looks up.

                             BAIN
               Why?  What happened?

                             RATH
               Didn't you here all them sirens?
               It's been all over the radio.  Some
               guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch
               of bystanders, in the Trattoria
               Roma.

                             BAIN
               No shit.

                             RATH
               Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli,
               and I don't care what office he's
               running for, the guy's a crook.  He
               probably had it coming, but all the
               other people.  Real sad.

                             BAIN
               Yeah.

                             RATH
               But they caught the guy.  I heard it
               all.  Sounded like he just went
               berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting
               anybody.  Drugs, probably.

                             BAIN
               Probably.

                             RATH
               I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send
               that S.O.B. right to the chair.

     Bain allows himself a bemused smile.

                             BAIN
               Sizzle lean.

     The cab passes the intersection for the airport.

     Bain sits up.

                             BAIN
               What are you doing?

                             RATH
               What?

                             BAIN
               That was Peterson back there.  That
               goes to the expressway for the
               airport.

                             RATH
               You're right.  Talking too much
               again.

                             BAIN
               Yeah well, you just blew your tip,
               pal.

                             RATH
               What?  You think I'm running you up?

                             BAIN
               Just do your job.

     Rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park.

                             BAIN
               What are you doing?

                             RATH
               Get out.  You think I'm running you
               up?  Get out.

                             BAIN
               You can't --

                             RATH
               The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I
               don't like you.  So, get the hell
               out!

     Bain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the
     dashboard and the missing ID.

     Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror.

                             BAIN
               Holy fucking shit!

     The cab rocks as both men move.  Instantly guns fill their
     hands.  Bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the
     dead cops.  Rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free
     from his jacket.

     Bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops.  He
     looks at Rath.  He wants him to run.  Anyone who moves
     away from the bullet proof glass is dead.

     Both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun
     sights.

     Bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip.

                             BAIN
               I get out, you got me.

     Bain reaches over and closes the door.  He smiles knowing
     it is the right move.

                             BAIN
               Now what?

     Rath calmly uncocks his gun.

                             RATH
               We're both going to the airport.

     Bain nods.

                             RATH
               Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.

                             BAIN
               No fucking way.

                             RATH
               Okay, don't.

     Bain thinks.

                             RATH
               If either of us fucks around, the
               other can blow the fuel line.

     He points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs.

     Bain sits back, aiming his gun, watching Rath.

     Rath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his
     gun on the fuel line.

     He puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic,
     turning back towards Peterson.

     They sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit
     the expressway.  Bain can't contain himself, giddy on
     adrenaline.

                             BAIN
               Jesus -- I'm being driven to the
               airport by Robert Rath.

     He laughs.

                             BAIN
               I can't believe this.  You rolled
               some cabby for the radio, then
               waited for an airport fare.

     He laughs again.

                             BAIN
               Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're
               a fucking genius.  Then you're just
               sitting there, bullshitting with me.
               Man, no way I coulda done that!

                             RATH
               What's your name?  We both know it's
               not Nicholai.

                             BAIN
               Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to
               know my name.

     He leans back.  This is a big moment for him.

                             BAIN
               Bain.  Michael Bain.

                             RATH
               How long have you been freelance?

                             BAIN
               Two years.  Two long fucking years.

     Something occurs to him and he leans close to the window.

                             BAIN
               Hey.  What I don't get was why
               didn't you take the shot inside the
               restaurant?  I mean you had me, a
               free shot.  That's what I would have
               done.

                             RATH
               It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty-
               forty, at best.  Not my odds.

                             BAIN
               Sounds like chickenshit --

     He laughs hard.

                             BAIN
               Listen to me calling you
               chickenshit!

     He stops laughing and looks closely at the back of Rath's
     head.

                             BAIN
               Is that a wig?  Shit, I hate wigs!
               Wigs are the worst part of this job.
               I'd rather dye my hair than wear a
               wig.

     Rath studies him.

                             RATH
               You're wearing a wig now.

     Bain chokes on his laugh.

                             BAIN
               God damn are you good.  Everyone
               says you're so fucking good.  I just
               can't believe I'm still alive.  If I
               believed in God, I'd be down on my
               knees.  Right now -- Hey, how come
               you just didn't plug us all when we
               came through the door?

     Rath does not answer.  Bain smiles.  He knows something
     about Rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people.

                             BAIN
               Shit if I was you, back there --

     He holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind Rath's
     head.

                             BAIN
               Game over.

     He laughs.

                             BAIN
               Do you mind if I ask you a couple of
               business questions?  You know I was
               wondering how much you bid this job
               at?

     Rath says nothing.

                             BAIN
               You don't have to tell me that.
               It's just, I know my bid was low,
               but was it too low?  I mean, did I
               seem like an amateur, like I didn't
               know what I was doing?

                             RATH
               We both know what you were doing.

     Bain moves close to the glass again, checking out Rath's
     gun.

                             BAIN
               Smith and Wesson .22 with an eight
               inch silencer.  Classic.  When I
               first heard you used that, I
               thought, shit, that's a lady's gun.
               Now, it's all I use.  Clean, real
               clean.

     He looks at the gun, still trained at the floor.

                             BAIN
               Would you really blow us?

     Rath does not have to answer.

                             BAIN
               Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this
               has been driving me crazy for years
               -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like
               some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but
               I just got to ask you.  Everybody
               talks about how you left the Agency
               and got into the business and then
               how you went after the Russian,
               Nicholai Talinkov --

                             RATH
               Tachlinkov.

                             BAIN
               Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a
               fucking genius.  They said he shaded
               you over and over.  And in the end,
               he aced you again.  Shaded and
               faded.  They say he's living on some
               Greek island, but I say that's
               fucking bullshit.  I say you're the
               best and that you planted his ass.
               Am I right?

     Rath says nothing.

                             BAIN
               I bet I'm right.

     The car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the
     Cleveland airport.

                             BAIN
               Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus
               fucking Christ!

                             RATH
               After those cops, you'll never be
               able to come back to Cleveland.

                             BAIN
               Who the fuck cares about Cleveland.
               Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks
               have they got here?  Greasy mobster,
               teamster or some hand job
               politician.  I want the money marks.
               I want the marks that you get.

     A long beat of silence.

     The CAB RUMBLES up onto the "departures" ramp which
     circles past all of the terminals.

                             BAIN
               So what happens now?

                             RATH
               We go around once.

                             BAIN
               Bullshit.

     He throws off his seatbelt.

                             BAIN
               You tell me that we're gonna go
               around once, then, while I'm
               checking out the lay of the land,
               you bail out and send me flying over
               the bridge.  Right?  Am I right?

     Rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the
     police and airport security.

     Rath studies the terrain.  Bain studies Rath.

     Soon they have passed the entire airport.  Rath nods.
     Steering the car through traffic in onto a circle
     interchange that will bring them to the beginning.

     Bain wipes the sweat from his face.

                             RATH
               Okay.

                             BAIN
               What?  What's okay?

     Rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange.

                             BAIN
               What are you doing?

                             RATH
               There's a sand barricade up ahead;
               I'm going to ram this cab into it.
               The cab has an airbag, odds are good
               I'll survive.  But with this steel
               casing and bullet proof glass, odds
               for you are not so good.

     Bain laughs.

                             BAIN
               Oh man, that's sweet.  That's
               fucking sweet.

     The speedometer continues to climb.

                             BAIN
               You're bluffing.

     Rath says nothing.  Ahead, at the ramp to the terminals,
     is the sand barricade.

                             BAIN
               You're fucking with me.  You want me
               to jump.  I jump, you hit the brakes
               and bang -- Game over.

     The cab is flying at its target.

                             BAIN
               No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to
               jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm
               stuck back here until it's too late.
               Wham -- over!

                             RATH
               I know you're going to jump.

     Bain looks at him and then at the barricade.

                             RATH
               You're still young.  Young enough to
               still think you're indestructible.
               Invincible.  You believe with utter
               certainty you can bail out at the
               last second and survive.

     The barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the
     windshield.

                             RATH
               If you do survive, we'll see each
               other again.

     Bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself
     out.

     Rath jams on the brakes, TIRES SCREAMING, steering into
     the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of
     sand as --

     Bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped
     across water.

     A driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him.

     SAND EXPLODES from the impact and the cab bounces up over
     the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag
     balloons out of the steering wheel.

     Bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a
     piece of roadkill.

     The cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the
     radiator spitting out a cloud of WHISTLING STEAM.

     Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car
     stopping inches from him.  A woman jumps out, rushing to
     the front of the car, but Bain is gone.

     Police CARS ROAR up into the midst of the accident.  One
     of them pulling alongside the demolished cab.  The door is
     open, the airbag popped.  Rath is gone.


     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     A large six flat leans out from a hill in San Francisco.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - DAY

     The apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the
     windows.

     The dining and living rooms look like the control booth of
     a network television show, stacks of video monitors and
     consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic
     cord duct-taped to the floors, walls and ceilings.  They
     snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang
     everywhere like some technological jungle.

     At the center of this tangled web is ELECTRA, a beautiful
     athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a
     worn robe.  She is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a
     bowl of popcorn in her lap.

     On the monitors, she is watching what at first might be
     mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an
     argument.

     What is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish-
     eye lens staring down into the room.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               I don't give a shit what your mother
               thinks.  I'm not sleeping with your
               mother, I'm sleeping with you.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               You won't be for long, with that
               attitude.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               Jesus, Jennifer, if you're so god
               damned worried about your mother's
               approval, why don't you move back
               home so she can pat you on the head
               when you do something right.

                             ELECTRA
               Jerk.

     Jennifer is too stunned to say anything.  There is a long
     pause that is not at all like television.  It seems very
     real.

     She starts to say something, but stops, trying to keep
     herself from crying.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               Oh good.  Go ahead and cry.

                             JENNIFER (WOMAN) (V.O.)
               Would you please leave?

     Electra lifts her head, smelling the air.

                             ELECTRA
               Mmm, smell that, Nikita?

     Nikita, Electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across
     the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently.  Every
     corner of the chair has been clawed open.

     Electra reaches for the control board and throws a series
     of switches.

     The monitors flicker as the image changes.  We are now
     looking down into a kitchen.  A stove is beneath us,
     almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking
     out a tray of chocolate chip cookies.

     Electra smells them again, smiling as she inhales.

                             ELECTRA
               I hope she saves some for us.

     There is a BANG, a DOOR SLAMMING in another apartment, and
     a MAN YELLING.

     Electra switches back to Jennifer's apartment.

     The man is still in the living room, but Jennifer is gone.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               Do you think slamming doors is going
               to help work this out?

     Electra punches a command into a keyboard.  Several of the
     screens change, showing different rooms of the same
     apartment.  Jennifer is in the bedroom, lying on the bed
     sobbing, her face buried in a pillow.

                             MAN (V.O.)
               I can slam doors too!

     We hear the front DOOR SLAM in the hall outside of
     Electra's apartment and through the monitor speakers.  His
     stomping FOOTSTEPS FADE as he storms down the hall and
     staircase out of the building.

     Electra switches all of the screens to Jennifer.

     She watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom.

     Electra reaches out; her fingers lightly touch the monitor
     screen.


     INT. APARTMENT HALL

     Electra's front door opens slowly.  Timidly, she steps out
     of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is
     standing in front of Jennifer's door.

     She starts to knock, but stops herself.  She isn't sure
     she should do this.

     She paces, then turns to the door.

     She knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear.

     She stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when
     she hears Jennifer.

                             JENNIFER (O.S.)
               Hello?  Ken, is that you?

     Electra panics.

     The door knob turns, the door opens and JENNIFER looks out
     into the hall.  It is empty.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     On the monitors, Electra watches Jennifer pick up the
     phone.

                             JENNIFER (V.O.)
               Hi, Mom, it's me.  Ken and I just
               had a big fight.

     Electra's PAGER suddenly SOUNDS.  She shuts down the
     screens and pulls out the pager, checking the number.

                             ELECTRA
               Crap.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     There is a system set up that is not unlike Rath's system;
     all of the same components, though the equipment is
     bigger, more powerful and less portable.

     On a table there is a bank of phones, several cellular.
     Electra is talking on one.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Electra, they are not paying you to
               sit at home and watch television.

     Electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks; each
     has a MicroCell trademark and is labeled "Back-Up."

                             ELECTRA
               I wasn't watching television.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               The point is, they are paying for
               information.  Real information.  Not
               tooth paste brands.  Not whether he
               wads of folds his toilet paper.  And
               no 16 hours of recorded phone sex.
               You are wasting everyone's time with
               this shit.

                             ELECTRA
               I thought it was interesting --

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               God damnit, Electra.  This is not a
               game.  This is business.

                             ELECTRA
               Right.  In my hands I have five
               back-up disks he made of all of his
               work last night.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?

                             ELECTRA
               I'll make my usual arrangements and
               expect my usual bonus.

                             WOMAN (V.O.)
               Electra --

                             ELECTRA
               A pleasure doing business with you.

     She hangs up.


     INT. LOBBY

     Electra comes down the stairs.

     Outside the large glass door she sees KEN, Jennifer's
     boyfriend, leaving.

     On the lobby floor is a letter, apparently slipped under
     the door, addressed to Jennifer Morgan.

     Electra looks out the front door window, making sure that
     Ken is gone.

     She picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Rath is at his computer system.

     He is staring at it, like it is a living thing, a person
     that he despises, the blank screen reflecting his own
     face.  It is an effort to bring himself to touch the
     keyboard, to type in his code.

     He waits.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Hello, Robert.

     Rath wants to type something but hesitates.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I know what happened.

                             RATH
               I bet you fucking know!

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               It cost us.

     Rath jumps out of his chair, screaming at the screen.

                             RATH
               I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit!
               Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking
               gone!

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               He stole another contract.

     Rath turns from the monitor, pacing.  Trying to collect
     himself.

                             RATH
               I'm being set up.  Fucking set up!

     He looks at the chess board.  He hovers over it, the
     pattern completely familiar.

                             RATH
               Is this how it went, Nick?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Robert?  Robert?

     Rath turns back to the screen, speaking as he types.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               How did he know?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Know what?

                             RATH/SCREEN
               The fucking contract!  How in the
               fuck did he know.

     A long beat.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Such language in front of a lady.

     Rath still talking and typing.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               I don't know what the fuck you are.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I know.  It was a joke.

     Rath stands, no longer typing.

                             RATH
               A joke?  A joke?

     Rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the
     screen.

                             RATH
               You think this is a fucking joke?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               $1,000,000.

     Rath looks at the number.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               That's the bonus on the contract.

     Rath puts the gun down.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Deadline?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese.
               His retirement a condition of the
               bonus.

     The FAX MACHINE COMES TO LIFE, printing an inky image.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               Who is the mark?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance
               specialist.

                             RATH
               A player?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               We have an M.O... Her system is
               protected by her 'pussy virus.'

     Rath looks at the fax; almost entirely black except for
     the wide, slit-iris cat eyes.


     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     There is a SCREECH and BLAST of ENGINES as a 747 touches
     down, heat rising off the tarmac.


     INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     Several passengers walk through the gate into the
     terminal.

     Across from the gate, Rath sits in a grungy airport
     cafeteria, reading a folded paper.

     He is wearing an airport security uniform, a gun holstered
     to his side.

     Taped inside the newspaper is a faxed Interpol photograph
     of a Japanese man wanted for "industrial espionage."

     At the gate, five Japanese men emerge.  Leading the group
     is the man in Rath's photo.  The other four are obviously
     muscle.

     Rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall.
     When they are almost out of sight, he folds his newspaper
     and begins to follow.

     His pace and manner is that of a cautious predator.  His
     focus shifts continually from face to face, expecting to
     find Bain's.

     His hand hovers near his gun.

     Ahead of him a thin young man, wearing a long blue trench
     coat, stops.  Rath cannot see his face.

     The man starts toward a drinking fountain.

     Rath catches a glimpse of his face.  It could be Bain, but
     he isn't sure.

     The young man bends over and slurps at the stream of
     water.  He rises into the barrel of Rath's .22.

     A mouthful of water coughs from his mouth.

     It is not Bain and in the next instant, the gun is gone.

                             RATH
               Sorry.  My mistake.

     Rath continues.  They young man is unable to move.


     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - DAY

     The five men stride through the automated terminal doors
     and towards a waiting limousine.

     Further down, Rath, now wearing a black T-shirt and jeans,
     exits and hails a cab.


     INT. CAB

                             RATH
               Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that
               black limo.  We're not sure which
               hotel we're at, so could you just
               follow them?

                             CABBY
               Sure.

     Rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as
     the cab pulls away.


     INT. LIMOUSINE

     The five men sit in silence.  Strangely, a PHONE begins to
     RING.

     The older man, whose name is AKIRA, opens his briefcase,
     removing a cellular phone.

                             AKIRA
               Hello?

     We hear Electra's voice.  She speaks in Japanese; he uses
     English.

                             ELECTRA (V.O.)
               I trust your flight was comfortable?

                             AKIRA
               Your Japanese is excellent.

                             ELECTRA (V.O.)
               Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone.

                             ELECTRA
               I'll call you again in twenty
               minutes.

     She punches a button and shoves the antennae down.

     The hotel room looks like her apartment.  There is a
     computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the
     wood laminate desk.  Cables whip and wind across the
     carpeted floor to the central air duct.

     The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray
     coaxial run up inside the duct.

     Immediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations.
     She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on-
     line.

     On the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that
     looks exactly like the one she is in.


     INT. CAB

     Rath stares out the window, watching the surrounding
     traffic, the limo still in sight.

     Something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded
     newspaper where he had hid the contract file.

     He flips past several documents before finding what he's
     looking for; the cat.

     He pulls the dark fax of Nikita and stares at it.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches
     Electra rush about.

     Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks
     it out.

                             ELECTRA
               Excuse me, your Highness.

     Nikita casually walks off the bed.

     Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a
     long piece of duct-tape.


     EXT. HYATT HOTEL

     The limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway.

     The cab pulls in behind it.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone.


     INT. HYATT LOBBY

     The Japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and
     uncomfortable.

     The BRIEFCASE RINGS.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is pacing again.

                             ELECTRA
               Room 1414.


     INT. HYATT LOBBY

     With several other guests, the Japanese men crowd into an
     elevator.  The doors close.

     Across the lobby, Rath enters, walking past the elevators.


     INT. ELEVATOR

     As the elevator rises, we begin to hear a SOUND, a
     familiar sound.

     Cramped in the corner is Bain.  He is PLAYING "TETRIS,"
     wearing dark sunglasses and a WALKMAN PUMPING SPEED METAL
     into his ears.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra continues to pace, checking the monitors.


     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN

     At the switchboard, a YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE wearing an
     operator's headset, takes a late breakfast order, typing
     the order in the hotel computer.

                             YOUNG MAN (YOUNG HOTEL EMPLOYEE)
               Yes, sir.  That'll be up in about
               thirty minutes.  You're welcome.

     He turns around and Rath is right behind him.


     INT. ELEVATOR

     The fourteenth floor; the BELL CHIMES, the doors slide
     open and the clump of Japanese men get out.

     Just as the doors begin to close, Bain steps out.


     INT. HALL

     Bain follows them down the hall, still PLAYING the GAME.
     There is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on
     its prey.

     As Akira finds 1414 and opens the door, another door burst
     open, a large family, heading for the pool.

     The moment is gone; the Japanese men close the door and
     Bain continues down the hall again, PLAYING the GAME.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     When the Japanese men enter the suite, we realize that
     this is the image on Electra's monitors.  Surveillance
     camcorders and microphones are mounted in various
     locations to display every inch of the room.  The group
     hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes.

     The four goons have their hands in their jackets.

     A small LAPTOP COMPUTER sits on the coffee table HUMMING
     SOFTLY.  It is the only noise in the room until a speaker
     crackles.

                             ELECTRA/SPEAKER (V.O.)
               Good morning, gentlemen.  I
               apologize for the arrangement, but
               we all know those aren't business
               cards you're reaching for.  If
               anyone leaves this room, the deal's
               off.


     INT. ROOM SERVICE KITCHEN

     The operator is unconscious, slumped in the corner.

     Rath studies the hotel computer screen intently, the
     information rolling by.

     We see that it is the previous night's room service
     receipts.

                             RATH
               One vegetarian plate and a can of
               tuna fish.  Room 1014.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men
     as she speaks into the microphone.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten thousand dollars per disk.
               Insert the first disk now.

     On the monitor, we see Akira at the coffee table shove the
     first disk into the laptop disk drive.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     Akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a
     goon, who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar
     bills, down the central air duct.

     The little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies.


     INT. HYATT HALL

     Bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of
     "TETRIS."

     Suddenly, he stops.

                             BAIN
               Yes!

     The display of the game reads "Game Over" and
     congratulates Bain on a new high score.

     Bain stands, smiling.  He puts the game in his pocket and
     starts down the hall.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is crouched at the open duct, grabbing another
     stack of money, stuffing it into her bag.

     A LOUD BANG EXPLODES out of the SPEAKERS and she looks up
     at the monitor.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     The lock on the door has been broken and standing in the
     frame is Bain.

                             BAIN
               Surprise!

     He raises his arm, his GUN spitting SILENT BULLETS.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs the
     nearest bodyguard, FIRING a SHOT into his belly.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh, God.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE

     Another SHOT and the second bodyguard falls.  The other
     two draw their handguns and Bain shields himself with the
     lifeless body of his first victim.

     They FIRE at Bain but are unable to hit him.

     Bain squeezes off TWO MORE SHOTS and the two men fall
     dead.  He lets his human shield fall to the ground and
     levels his gun on the shaking Akira.

                             AKIRA
               Don't kill me.

     Bain looks at him and smiles, then FIRES.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the
     modem.

     Bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it.

                             BAIN (V.O.)
               Tricky.  Boy, you just can't trust
               anyone these days.

     He licks the lens, leaving a smear of saliva.

     She stuffs the disks into her bag.  She puts Nikita in her
     "travel kitty" and charges for the door, grabbing her
     coat.

     Flinging it over her shoulder, she does not notice the
     letter from Ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from
     the room.


     INT. HALL

     Electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes.
     She is staring down the barrel of Rath's .22.

                             RATH
               Don't be stupid and you will live.

     The elevator behind Rath opens and closes against a hotel
     lobby ashtray.  He waves her into the elevator with his
     gun.

                             RATH
               Hurry.


     EXT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY

     Electra's black CAR ROARS out of the garage, onto the open
     street.


     INT. HYATT HOTEL - DAY

     The door swings open.  From the hall we can hear the
     familiar BEEPING of the COMPUTER GAME.  The room, 1014, is
     the same as Electra had left it when she ran out.

     Jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of Ken's
     letter.


     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR

     Electra drives, obviously nervous, as Rath watches out the
     rear window.

                             RATH
               Turn here.

     No one follows.  He turns back to her.

                             RATH
               How many bodies were there?

     He checks his watch.

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               He has to clean up.  How many bodies
               were there?

                             ELECTRA
               Um, five.

                             RATH
               One hour per man.

     Rath sets the timer on his watch for five hours.


     INT. HYATT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Bain has returned to room 1414.  Wearing rubber gloves, he
     clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of
     rug cleaner.

     He picks up the phone for room service.

                              BAIN
               Hi.  This is room 1414 --

     Behind him, in the bathroom mirror, we see one of the
     Japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet.  He is
     naked.

                             BAIN
               Yes, could you send up a pot of
               coffee and my friends are going to
               need some more towels.  Thanks.

     He hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large
     blood stains on the carpet.  He points the rug cleaner at
     the stain covering it with white foam.


     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR

     Rath sees the entrance for the expressway.

                             RATH
               Get on the expressway.

                             ELECTRA
               Where are we going?

     Rath glances back.

                             RATH
               Nowhere yet.

     Electra turns onto the highway and NIKITA HOWLS from the
     "travel kitty" in the back seat.

                             ELECTRA
               Nikita, hush.

     NIKITA wants out and HOWLS again.

                             ELECTRA
               She won't stop unless you let her
               out.

     Rath reaches back and opens the box.  Nikita springs into
     the front seat onto Rath's lap.

                             RATH
               Nikita?  She helped me find you.

                             ELECTRA
               What?  How did you know I had a cat?

                             RATH
               Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I
               guessed right.

                             ELECTRA
               Who the fuck are you?  Who do you
               work for?

                             RATH
               I work for the government.

                             ELECTRA
               Yeah?

     She studies his face, his eyes.

                             ELECTRA
               Bullshit.

                             RATH
               Yeah.

                             ELECTRA
               You're one of them, aren't you?  A
               fucking pro.

                             RATH
               I'm part of the game, just like you.

     Electra pounds the steering wheel.

                             ELECTRA
               Jesus!

     He reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag.

                             ELECTRA
               What do you think you're doing?

     Rath plucks out the bundles of money.

                             RATH
               Twenty large?  That's all?

                             ELECTRA
               What do you mean, 'that's all'?
               What in the hell do you know?

                             RATH
               The bonus on the contract for you
               was one million dollars.

     Electra seems ready to jump out of her skin.  The
     speedometer is floating around 90.

                             RATH
               Slow down.

     He pulls out the disks.

                             RATH
               I figure that means these are worth
               ten times that, maybe more.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten million --

                             RATH
               Now you understand why I'm here.

     Electra wants to scream.  The speedometer is climbing over
     100.

                             RATH
               I really think you should slow down.


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     The room is immaculate; near the door, several over-sized
     suitcases line the wall.

     Bain is sitting at the desk.  His WALKMAN is on, MUSIC
     BLASTING, as he flips casually through the telephone
     directory.

     His finger eases down a column stopping at "Morgan
     Jennifer."

     There is a KNOCK at the door.

     He smiles and tears out the page.

     There is another, LOUDER KNOCK which Bain hears this time.
     He TURN OFF the WALKMAN and opens the door; a BELLBOY is
     waiting with a luggage cart.

                             BELLBOY
               Hello, sir.  Have you some luggage
               you need carried.

     Bain gives him a wink and a smile.

                             BAIN
               Indeed I do.


     INT. ELECTRA'S CAR - NIGHT

     The red "low fuel" light is on.

                             ELECTRA
               Now what?

                             RATH
               Turn off the engine.

     Electra twists the ignition and the CAR DIES.  Rath
     glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas
     station.

                             ELECTRA
               You want me to pump?

                             RATH
               No, stay in the car.  I want you to
               understand something.  If I intended
               to kill you, you would already be
               dead.

     Electra says nothing.

     He reaches over and takes the car keys.

     When he is out of the car, Electra slowly releases the
     strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think,
               breathe, think...

     Electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as Rath
     pumps the gas.  Her eyes flash down to her bag.

     Outside, Rath watches Electra through the windows.  She
     appears motionless.

     The electric gas counter races like a stop watch.

     In the car, Electra eases her hand into her bag.

     The tank full, Rath re-hangs the pump.  He walks around
     the car and heads for the station.

     Electra waits until his back is turned.  She pulls her
     tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire
     stripper.  Reaching under the dash, she yanks out a
     tangled handful of wire.

     She looks up; Rath is inside paying.

                             ELECTRA
               Come on, come on, it's a cake walk.

     Her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping,
     stripping, twisting.

     Rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking
     for him.  It takes only a second for him to realize what
     she is doing.

                             RATH
               Oh shit.

     He runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and
     strikes them; the BATTERY GRINDS.

                             ELECTRA
               Please, please.

     He is almost there when the ENGINE FIRES.  She stomps on
     the gas, ramming the shift into drive.

     TIRES SQUEALING, the car swerves forward as Rath slams
     into it.  He bounces backward, falling to the ground.

     The car fishtails away, accelerating as Rath rolls to one
     knee, his gun automatically in his hand.  He draws a bead,
     but, he does not shoot.

     With a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.

                             RATH
               Dammit.


     EXT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     Electra's car is parked out front.

     She unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT LOBBY

     Standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is
     Jennifer Morgan.  What she was hoping for is not there.
     She looks up and sees Electra.

                             JENNIFER
               Excuse me --

     Electra stops.

                             JENNIFER
               You live here, don't you?

     Electra nods.

                             JENNIFER
               I'm sorry, this may sound really
               weird, but my friend told me he
               slipped a letter under the door here
               and I was wondering if you happened
               to see it?

     Electra is in a daze, her hand moving into her pocket.

                             ELECTRA
               Letter?

                             JENNIFER
               Yeah.  He said he saw a woman with
               dark hair going into the building
               when he dropped it off.

                             ELECTRA
               No.  I don't have it.

     Electra's mouth opens and she backs away.  Jennifer is
     bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it.

                             JENNIFER
               I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to -- I'm
               sorry.

     She shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving Electra
     in the lobby.

     Electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to
     pocket.

     A worried expression tightens her face; the letter is
     gone.

     She opens the interior door, following Jennifer up the
     stairs.


     INT. STAIRCASE

     Electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the
     possibilities, filled with fear.

     By the time Electra reaches the top floor, Jennifer is
     entering her apartment.

     Electra hurries past Jennifer's door to her own.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Electra flies across the living room to the monitors.

     She clicks them on, putting on Jennifer's channel.

     On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking
     her phone messages.  One from her mother.

     Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifer's entire
     apartment is in front of her.

     On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the
     oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room.

     Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath.

     Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out.
     Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just
     been.

     Wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail that
     she had dropped on the table and sorts through it.

     Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference
     to Jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as though
     he knew she couldn't see him.

     He moves into a room, just as she moves out.

     Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is
     unable to turn away.

     Bain searches through a desk drawer, while Jennifer starts
     undressing for her bath.

     He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom.
     If Jennifer would turn around she would see him.

     Electra is about to run, to call out when --

     Something catches Bain's eye.

     He moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is
     looking straight up into the camera.

     He inches towards it, not sure what it is.  The fiber
     optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over
     the bed.

     Staring at it, he is looking right at Electra.

     Bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he
     moves close to the fish-eye lens.  Poking it with his
     finger, he realizes what it is.  A warped smile stretches
     across his face as he whispers --

                             BAIN (V.O.)
               Oh, you sick little bitch --

     Electra tears away from the screen, panic seizing hold of
     her.

     She rips entire drawers out of her dresser, dumping them
     into a suitcase, stuffing in anything that looks
     important.  She grabs Nikita in the "travel kitty."


     EXT. BACK PORCH

     The door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind
     her as --

     Bain turns from the back stairs.

     She leaps back inside as he whips out his GUN, PUMPING TWO
     HOLES in the door.


     INT. ELECTRA'S APARTMENT

     She scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase,
     still clutching the "travel kitty," as --

     The back DOOR EXPLODES from its hinges, Bain charging,
     FIRING his GUN.

     BULLETS HISSING past her, Electra crashes through the
     front door into the hall.


     INT. HALL

     The stairs are at the far end.  She is only halfway,
     when --

     Rath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked.

     Electra drops to the floor as --

     Behind her, Bain barrels from the apartment.

     Rath FIRES.

     The wood DOOR SPLINTERS, BULLET HOLES surrounding Bain.
     Off balance, he lunges back into the apartment.

     Rath continues FIRING, grabbing hold of Electra.

     They run down the stairs.


     EXT. REAR STAIRCASE

     Bain leaps down the flights.


     EXT. ALLEY

     Bain rushes into the street, looking in every direction.
     They are gone.

                             BAIN
               Fuck me!


     EXT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL - NIGHT

     Somewhere in the city.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra and Rath enter the room together but they are both
     immediately alone.

     She walks across the room to a chair in the corner,
     curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into her
     lap.

     He sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of
     the room and sits.

     They watch each other.  Silence.

     Between then is the liquor cabinet.  Rath knows a good
     idea when he sees one.

                             RATH
               Want a drink?

     Her face is as expressionless as Nikita's.

     He pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down.
     Takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.

                             RATH
               Okay...

     He returns to his table with his drink.

                             RATH
               I'm not good at this sort of thing,
               but we don't have a lot of time, so
               I'll just go ahead and get started.
               First:  you.  I ask myself, 'What is
               she thinking?'

     Her body tightens, coils.

                             RATH
               Simple.  She's scared.  She's almost
               been killed twice and now she is
               alone in a room with a man that she
               believes is an... assassin.

     Another deep pull on the bourbon.

                             RATH
               Furthermore she was brought here not
               entirely on her own accord which
               only increases her fear and
               suspicion.  Thus, as long as she is
               afraid, her first, maybe her only
               thought will be escape.  Does that
               leave me any other option?

     He slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping
     out his gun.

                             RATH
               No.

     Crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it
     to her.  She looks at it.  Back at him.

     He puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks
     to the bar.

     She picks up the gun.

                             RATH
               The gun is silenced.  She could
               shoot me right now.

     She stands, Nikita jumping from her lap.

                             RATH
               She could take the car and be far
               from here before the maid comes in
               the morning, but --

     She starts squeezing OFF ROUNDS; the LAMP EXPLODES, the
     CHAIRS around him ERUPT, tufts of white stuffing leaping
     into the air.

                             ELECTRA
               Shut up!

     He freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.

                             ELECTRA
               Stop trying to tell me what I'm
               thinking!

     She moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.

                             ELECTRA
               I'll tell you what you're thinking
               -- you think I'm not going to shoot
               you but right now you're not so
               sure, are you?

     A slight shake of the head, no.

                             ELECTRA
               You're thinking that maybe it was a
               mistake to give me this gun, that
               maybe I'm not going to think about
               things logically because I'm a woman
               and I'm freaked out and I'm going to
               do something impulsive and
               irrational -- right?

     She FIRES the GUN to both sides of his head.  He's
     surprised to be alive.

                             ELECTRA
               You don't know shit about me!  Now
               sit down!

     He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression
     she had worn sitting a moment ago.

     She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles
     of liquor.  She sucks it all down and throws the bottle
     across the room.

     Grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay.  How did you find me?

                             RATH
               You're the computer hacker, you tell
               me.

                             ELECTRA
               You didn't know anything about me.

     Nikita rubs up against her leg.

                             ELECTRA
               Nikita?

                             RATH
               Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian.
               There aren't that many.

     She nods, slurping at her bottle.

                             ELECTRA
               You're one of them, aren't you?

                             RATH
               'Them'?

                             ELECTRA
               An assassin?

                             RATH
               Until a minute ago.

                             ELECTRA
               What does that mean?

                             RATH
               If I still was what I used to be,
               you would not be pointing that at
               me.

     Electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now.

                             ELECTRA
               Who is that other guy?

                             RATH
               Another contractor.

                             ELECTRA
               Someone hired both of you?

                             RATH
               No.  They hired Bain.  The contract
               would have been mine, but Bain took
               it from me as he took the previous
               one.

                             ELECTRA
               So this is something between you and
               him?

                             RATH
               He stole the contract knowing that
               I would come after him.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because he is trying to retire me.

                             ELECTRA
               He wants to kill you?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               The nature of the business.  You
               remove your competition.

                             ELECTRA
               And you want to use me to get him?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Forget it!

                             RATH
               We don't have a choice.

     She FIRES the GUN, pocking the wall behind him.

                             ELECTRA
               Don't tell me I don't have a choice!

                             RATH
               Right.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm two seconds away from making my
               choice which means you've got two
               seconds to tell me why I shouldn't
               shoot you.

                             RATH
               It's simple.  You need me.  I need
               you.  And we will both need money.

                             ELECTRA
               I don't need you to get the money --
               my money!

                             RATH
               If it hadn't been for me, you would
               be dead.

     She's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that.

                             ELECTRA
               I don't need the money.

                             RATH
               This is something that is never
               going to end.  You can never work in
               the business again with this
               contract, because he will find you.
               To survive, you have to go into deep
               hiding.  And that's going to take
               money, a lot of money.

                             ELECTRA
               Then you can have the disks and I'll
               just walk out that door --

                             RATH
               If you walk out that door, Bain will
               still come after you.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because he took a contract on you.
               He'll come for you and he'll find
               you.

                             ELECTRA
               You don't know that -- you're trying
               to scare me.
     
                             RATH
               No.  It's the truth.  I know what
               you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're
               a ghost, you're not part of the real
               world.  You don't have a social
               security number.  You don't pay
               taxes.  You've probably used ten
               different names over the last ten
               years.  A long time ago something
               probably happened, something illegal
               and you ran, you disappeared and it
               was easy.  You think you can do it
               again.  But I'm telling you, fading
               from the law is nothing.  No matter
               what you do, where you go, I swear
               to you that Bain will find you.

                             ELECTRA
               How?

                             RATH
               Right now, as we sit here, he is
               tearing through your apartment.  He
               is digging through your drawers,
               emptying your closets.  He will take
               your telephone and address books,
               your appointment books.  If you keep
               a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go
               into the kitchen and find out what
               kind of food you eat, liquor you
               drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the
               bathroom he will find any
               prescription drugs you take and
               where you get them filled.  If you
               have video tape or recordings he
               will watch and listen to all of
               them.

     She is coming unglued.  Imagining him watching her tapes,
     going through her possessions.  She is moving, pacing,
     ready to explode.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh Jesus Jesus...

                             RATH
               He will know everything about you.
               Everything.  I know, because I've
               done it.  Once you've been inside a
               mark's home, you're in their head.
               If you're any good, you'll find the
               mark in a week, and Bain is good
               because I was the best and I
               couldn't take him.

     She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it
     everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in
     WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD.

     When she stops, he starts to say something but she levels
     the gun at him.

                             ELECTRA
               Shut up!  All right!  You've said
               enough!

     She forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample
     bottles.

                             ELECTRA
               I need to think... To be alone.

     With the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following
     at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the
     door.


     INT. BATHROOM

     She locks the door and then collapses.  Her body seems to
     fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall; the GUN
     and the BOTTLES falling from her arms, CLATTERING SOFTLY
     on the bath rug as she buries her face in her hands.


     INT. BEDROOM

     Very mechanically, Rath begins setting up his chess board,
     putting the pieces into the same positions.  It is a
     ritual, and with it he enters a kind of trance.

     From the bathroom, almost inaudible, he hears Electra
     CRYING.


     INT. BATHROOM

     With her head now buried in her arms and knees, she is
     sobbing, her body rocking.  The crying seems very similar
     to Jennifer's; a complete emotional release.


     INT. BEDROOM

     Rath stares at the board.  The CRYING grows LOUDER.  He
     stands and walks to the door.  He starts to knock but
     stops himself.

     Like Electra with Jennifer, Rath would like to help, he
     just has no idea how to.  He turns back to the desk, to
     his chess game.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Her eyes are now burning red.  She stops crying long
     enough to suck down an entire sample of Scotch.  Nikita
     rubs against her and she strokes her.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh shit, Nikita.


     INT. BEDROOM

     Rath is setting up his computer system.  He hears the TUB
     FILLING UP.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking.

                             ELECTRA
               Cheers.

     Electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor
     where we see that many of the bottles are now empty.

     In the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out a
     wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the
     water.


     INT. BEDROOM

     When Electra comes out of the bathroom, Rath is again at
     his chess game.  She sits down across from him and sets
     the gun on the table between them.

     Rath looks up at her.

                             ELECTRA
               Listen -- I don't even know your
               name.

                             RATH
               Rath.  Robert Rath.

                             ELECTRA
               Electra.

                             RATH
               Just Electra?

                             ELECTRA
               Yeah.

                             RATH
               As in daughter of Agamemnon?

                             ELECTRA
               No.  Just Electra.

     The conversation dies.

                             ELECTRA
               What I'm trying to say is that --
               I'm not sure I can do this, help
               you, unless I know more about you.

                             RATH
               What do you want to know?

                             ELECTRA
               If Bain hadn't taken the contract on
               me, would you have?

     He stares at her.

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because I'm done.

                             ELECTRA
               This is crazy.  I can't trust you.
               You can't trust me.  How can we
               possibly help each other?

     They sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying
     between them.

                             RATH
               Do you play?

     She looks at the chess board.

                             ELECTRA
               With computers.

                             RATH
               It's not the same, is it?

                             ELECTRA
               Better than playing with yourself.

     He smiles.

                             RATH
               I had an opponent.

     She understands that he is trying to tell her something.

                             ELECTRA
               Had?

                             RATH
               He was Russian.  Nicholai
               Tachlinkov.  A legend in the
               business when I was just starting.
               I admired him.  When I heard he
               loved chess I became obsessed with
               the game.

     Electra studies the board.

                             ELECTRA
               He was white?

     Rath nods.

                             ELECTRA
               It looks like white's game.

                             RATH
               We played with a code using The New
               York Times obituaries.  Over three
               years we played twelve matches.  I
               never won.

                             ELECTRA
               Why didn't you finish this game?

     She reaches over and lifts a White Knight and takes a
     Bishop.  Rath counters, taking her Knight.

                             RATH
               He was... taken.

                             ELECTRA
               He was killed.

     Rath nods.

     Throughout the entire conversation they continue to play
     out the chess game.

                             ELECTRA
               By who?

     A long beat.

                             RATH
               I killed him.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because that's how it works.  That's
               what it's about.  He was the best.
               He was on top.

                             ELECTRA
               Where you wanted to be?

                             RATH
               Yes.  As soon as you get into this
               business, all you can think about is
               getting to the top.  That's all
               there is.  Until then, there is
               nothing.  You are nothing.

                             ELECTRA
               How did you get into the business?

                             RATH
               The same way everyone does; the
               government, the Agency.

                             ELECTRA
               The C.I.A.?

                             RATH
               More or less.

                             ELECTRA
               How old were you?

                             RATH
               They recruited me when I was in high
               school.

                             ELECTRA
               Jesus -- why?

                             RATH
               Languages.  I was already fluent in
               nine languages.

                             ELECTRA
               You were like a boy genius?

                             RATH
               Some people said that.  I never
               thought so.

                             ELECTRA
               Why not?

                             RATH
               I was just different.

                             ELECTRA
               You went from high school to the
               Agency?

                             RATH
               No.  I graduated from George
               Washington University.  Then I
               entered the Agency training program.

                             ELECTRA
               They didn't give you a choice, did
               they?

                             RATH
               No, they didn't.

                             ELECTRA
               But you knew what they were training
               you for?

                             RATH
               Of course.  I was going to be James
               Bond.

                             ELECTRA
               Ahhhh...

                             RATH
               They are very good at what they do.
               It's very seductive.  The training,
               the weapons, the travel --

                             ELECTRA
               The exotic women.

                             RATH
               Women?  No... not really.

                             ELECTRA
               Why not?

                             RATH
               Women... I don't... I don't want to
               talk about women.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because you are a women.

                             ELECTRA
               Why did you leave the Agency?

                             RATH
               The same reason everyone does.  You
               hear your name on C-SPAN and you
               realize you're a skeleton in
               someone's closet and they're coming
               to bury you.

                             ELECTRA
               They tried to kill you?

                             RATH
               Yes.  It didn't matter much to them
               as long as I disappeared.

                             ELECTRA
               Then you went freelance?

                             RATH
               The only thing different about the
               private sector is that a General
               Contractor takes less of a
               percentage than the government, so
               you make more money.  Then once you
               make the transition, you realize you
               were never working for the
               government; it was always the
               private sector, the vested interests
               and it's the same vested interests
               that continue to buy your plane
               tickets.

                             ELECTRA
               Tell me about the first time.

                             RATH
               My first take?

                             ELECTRA
               Yes.

                             RATH
               Why?

                             ELECTRA
               Because I want to know.

                             RATH
               It was... mechanical.  Very precise.
               It was exactly like the training
               drill except for the adrenaline.

                             ELECTRA
               Are they usually like that?

                             RATH
               No.  Just the first one.

                             ELECTRA
               After that?

                             RATH
               They become complicated... messy.

                             ELECTRA
               Did it ever bother you?

                             RATH
               Did it ever bother James Bond?

                             ELECTRA
               That's fiction.

                             RATH
               This is fiction!  Don't you see
               that?  This is another reality.  And
               the people that come into the world
               to play this game -- nobody forces
               them!  They're here, they know the
               rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do
               you understand what I am saying?  No
               one is innocent -- including you!

                             ELECTRA
               Does that mean it didn't bother you?

     Rath leans back and stares at her.  She waits.

                             RATH
               You get a job swinging a hammer, the
               first day you get a blister, it
               tears open, it bleeds and it stays
               sore a long time.  You keep swinging
               the hammer, you get a good hard
               callous that covers that spot and it
               never bothers you again.

     Electra says nothing.  He leans forward and slides a rook
     into her back row.

                             RATH
               Check.

     He leans back.

                             RATH
               Is that what you wanted to hear?
               Something cold blooded... something
               remorseless...

                             ELECTRA
               No.  Something honest.

     A beat.  Rath likes this woman.

     She moves her Queen.

                             ELECTRA
               Mate.

     He smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               I hope your plan is better than your
               game.


     INT. CHEAP HOTEL - NIGHT

     The room is ugly.  Shag carpeting, wood paneling and
     polyester patterned curtains.

     We hear a COMPUTER KEYBOARD CLICKING away as we MOVE
     ACROSS a table.  The hotel phone is in a modem, which is
     held together with duct tape.  Between the modem and the
     computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of
     naked circuit boards.

     It is a very similar set up to Rath's, only it has been
     put together with a fraction of the resources.

     Bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  Beside
     the desk-top is a six pack of Old Style beer, a bag of
     Doritos and his Gameboy.

     On the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel
     is his cleaned gun.

     Bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks down
     his beer.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Where have you been, Michael?

     He belches.

     He is communicating with his General Contractor.

     On the table is a collection of personal objects, much of
     it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from Electra's house.

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               Tracking the mark.

     Bain fingers a pair of satin panties.  He smiles as he
     smells them.

                             BAIN
               I'm on the scent.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               You're too late.

     Bain slams his beer down.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               I've learned from MicroCell, Rath
               fulfilled the contract.

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               How?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               He took out the mark and sold the
               disks back to MicroCell.

     Bain falls back in his chair, thinking.  He runs his hands
     through his sweaty hair.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Michael?

                             BAIN
               No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               They money will be standard bank
               transfer.  We believe we will know
               where and when.

                             BAIN
               What?

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               How?

     There is no response.

                             BAIN/SCREEN
               How in the fuck do you know that?

     A long beat.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Such language in front of a lady.

                             BAIN
               I don't give a fuck what you are.  I
               asked you --

     He hits the repeat key.

                             BAIN
                       (types)
               How in the fuck do you know that?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Do you want Rath or not?

     Bain stares at the screen, thinking.  Thinking hard.


     INT. LARGE CHAIN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Another computer screen, but we don't know that it is
     different.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               It will take three days to arrange
               the transfer.

                             ELECTRA
               Three days?

     We are in Electra and Rath's hotel room.  She is standing
     behind him, reading as he types.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Which account?

                             ELECTRA
               Are you going to tell him?

                             RATH
               It.  Tell it.  For all I know it
               could be a machine.

                             ELECTRA
               You said you didn't trust it.

                             RATH
               I don't.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Which account?

                             ELECTRA
               What kind of bank is going to allow
               us to withdraw ten million dollars
               the day it is transferred?

                             RATH
               The kind preferred by drug
               smugglers, arms dealers and
               politicians.

     Rath types in an account number.

                             RATH
               Do you have a passport?

                             ELECTRA
               Several.

                             RATH
               Good.

                             ELECTRA
               Where is it?

                             RATH
               Mexico.


     INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

     Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section,
     which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping
     champagne.

                             ELECTRA
               God, I love first class.  I remember
               when I was a little girl, I would
               wonder what it was like up here.  I
               would always try to peek through the
               curtains.

     Rath says nothing, staring out the window.

     Electra shakes her head.

                             ELECTRA
               I hope Nikita's all right.

     He still does not respond.

                             ELECTRA
               Hey, where are you?

                             RATH
               Thinking.

                             ELECTRA
               About?

                             RATH
               Nothing.

     Electra sips the last of her champagne.

                             ELECTRA
               I've never been to the Gulf of
               Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?

                             RATH
               I don't know.

                             ELECTRA
               You were there?

     A long beat.

                             RATH
               Yes.


     EXT. SMALL MEXICAN AIRPORT - DAY

     The plane lands.


     EXT. TERMINAL CAB STAND

     Rath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them
     in his trunk.


     INT. CAB

     Rath speaks perfect Spanish.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               Good afternoon.  We have
               reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in
               Costa Blanca.

                             CABBY
                       (in Spanish)
               Yes, sir.
     

     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

     The cab pulls up in front of a large, brand new glass
     hotel, which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the
     gulf water.

     Rath is upset.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               No, no.  I said the Hotel Paraiso.

                             CABBY
                       (in Spanish)
               Yes.  This is the Hotel Paraiso.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the
               city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.

                             CABBY
                       (in Spanish)
               I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there
               was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso.
               This is the new Hotel Paraiso.

                             RATH
                       (in Spanish)
               Take us there.


     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - DAY

     American tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but
     much of the out-lying city is very poor.

     The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk.  The
     face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang
     in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of
     the building rather than the building itself.

     Rath stares at it, remembering.

     Electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza
     del Sol.

     He looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directly
     opposite of that.

     The International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful
     old building; its exterior walls are white-washed
     concrete, blindingly bright white.

     Electra looks at the bank and smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               So, that's where all that S & L
               money is?

     Rath is not listening to her.  He is somewhere else.  He
     turns back to the fourth story window.

                             RATH
               That's where he'll be.

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               I wasn't expecting this.  I need to
               think.


     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - NIGHT

     Beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to
     midnight oil.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ELEVATOR

     On one side of the elevator is a young couple who look
     like newlyweds.  They are cuddling, kissing and giggling
     as though they are alone.

     Electra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator.
     It is a strange contrast.

     Electra is staring at them.

     Rath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world.

     The ELEVATOR CHIMES and opens.

     Nobody moves.

     The DOORS CHIME again and start to close, as everyone
     realizes that this is their floor.

     Rath and the other man grab the doors, which spring back
     open.

     It is a funny, awkward moment, as everyone apologizes and
     smiles politely, on the way out.


     INT. HALL

     The couple move down the hall, the newlyweds finding their
     door first.

     Rath reaches the door to their room, opens it and enters.

     Electra lingers, watching the other couple, watching as he
     fumbles for his keys, her hand running up between his legs
     and over his ass.

     He finally manages to open the door and she pushes him
     inside.

     Electra softly closes her door.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HOTEL ROOM

     Rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding
     balcony doors at the dark gulf water.

                             ELECTRA
               Did you see them?

     Electra moves about the large suite.

                             ELECTRA
               They looked like they were in love.

     Rath says nothing.

                             ELECTRA
               Well, I think I'll take a bath.
               Come on, Nikita!

     The two of them walk into the bathroom, leaving Rath to
     himself.


     INT. BATHROOM

     Electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub, water
     running through her fingers as she adjusts the
     temperature.

     After a beat she hears a SMALL CRASH, a GLASS BREAKING.
     It is followed by other MUFFLED NOISES, a WOMAN GIGGLING
     and a THUMPING.  The sounds are coming from the other side
     of the tub wall, from the other suite.  Electra puts her
     ear against the tile to listen.

     The WATER FILLING her TUB is too loud for her to hear.
     She turns it OFF.

     There is more BUMPING and THUMPING, the WOMAN LAUGHING and
     then, the LAUGHS SHORTEN into SOFT WHIMPERS.

     Electra hangs on each sound, slowly lifted by it, moving
     up toward the over-head fan and ducts.

     The SOUNDS get LOUDER as she moves closer to the vents,
     until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub,
     listening to what is clearly the sounds of TWO PEOPLE
     MAKING LOVE.

     Their MOANS and SHRIEKS CLIMAX and Electra smiles.


     INT. BEDROOM

     It is dark now.  A single desk light is on, under which
     Rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in
     their familiar pattern.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom.  She seems very clean
     and fresh, wearing a long white T-shirt and thin robe.

                             ELECTRA
               That felt great.  You should try it.

     She watches him setting the pieces onto the board.

                             ELECTRA
               Don't you ever get tired of playing
               the same game?

     He looks at her.

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               Why not?

                             RATH
               It helps me to focus.  It centers
               me, helps me think.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh.  What do you think about?

                             RATH
               Work.  The things I need to get
               done.

     She sits across from him looking at the board.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you think about the game?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               But you've never figured out a way
               to win.

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               Not even a stalemate?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               What happens if you do?

     This strikes Rath as a very strange question and he is
     suddenly annoyed by her.

                             ELECTRA
               Can I ask you something?

     He knows she will anyway.

                             ELECTRA
               What will you do if this works, if
               we get the money?

                             RATH
               I don't know... maybe I'll live on a
               boat, sail to all the places I've
               never been.

                             ELECTRA
               That sounds nice.

     He finishes his glass of bourbon.

     She is not sure what to say next, if she should say
     anything at all.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like
               to try and get some sleep.

                             RATH
               You can have the bed.  The chair is
               fine for me.

     He pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from
     the ice bucket.

                             ELECTRA
               Thanks.

     She slips out of the robe and in between the sheets.

     Rath sits across the room, his back to her.

     She tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you think he's here?

                             RATH
               Here?

                             ELECTRA
               In Costa Blanca.

                             RATH
               Yes.

     She thinks.

                             ELECTRA
               What do you think he's doing?

                             RATH
               I don't know... But I'm sure he's
               not sleeping.

     She pulls the covers tightly to her chin.  Her eyes do not
     close.


     INT. HOTEL (COSTA BLANCA) - NIGHT

     A small hotel in the city, away from the beaches, built
     before there was such a thing as central air conditioning.

     Bain is naked, except for a small pair of camouflage
     jockeys and his Walkman strapped to his shoulder.  His
     head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in
     his ears.

     He is tearing open a long box wrapped in "Happy Birthday"
     paper.

     Inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle.
     He smiles.

     He assembles it quickly, snapping it together with
     automatic ease.  When the sight is tightened in place, he
     jumps up.

     In the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the
     gun.

     Not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself
     again.  He starts moving with the music, playing with the
     gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning
     it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  The gun zips
     and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes.

     The butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the
     scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.  He is
     sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move.

                             BAIN
               You're dead, motherfucker.


     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DAY

     Electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the
     warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea.

     Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame.

                             RATH
               Breakfast.

                             ELECTRA
               Why don't you bring it out here?
               It's beautiful out here.

     Rath steps a little farther out.  He looks down either
     side of the building, checking sight lines.  He looks out
     and sees another hotel with windows facing them.

     He turns to her.  Says nothing.  Moves back inside.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     The breakfast trays are empty.  Rath is sipping coffee,
     scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper.

     Electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach.

     He stops working.

                             ELECTRA
               I know what you are thinking.  I'm
               not going to disappear, okay?  I'm
               not going anywhere, just down there,
               to that beautiful beach.  I got to
               get out of this room, just for a
               little while.

                             RATH
               Okay.

                             ELECTRA
               Really?

                             RATH
               He won't be looking for you.  Just
               be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your
               sunglasses on.

                             ELECTRA
               Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.


     INT. HOTEL HALL

     Electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach.
     At the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get
     on the elevator.  She starts to call to them to hold it
     for her, but she stops herself.

     The elevator closes.

     She edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door
     to their suite.  She touches it with the tips of her
     fingers.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Rath is still at the table.

     The curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing
     through the open patio door.  They swell open and fall.
     It seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in
     the changing shape of the curtain.

     Rath stands.  He walks to the open door.  Standing in the
     frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below.

     He slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still.


     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - DAY

     Bain moves through the market, booths lining the edges of
     the plaza.  His eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses.

     He buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the
     plaza.

     He looks at the bank, at the military-style security
     guards that patrol the front.

     He turns in the plaza, checking the perimeter, his gaze
     falling on the tall, burned-out building.

     He looks back at the bank, imagining the sight line.

     He bites into the apricot, its juice gushing, running down
     his chin.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Rath is leaning back in the bed, NIKITA PURRING in his
     lap.

     He did not sleep last night and is very tired.  His eyes
     fight to stay open.

     The sound of the TELEVISION momentarily hangs in the hotel
     room as he sleeps.  The program is a SPANISH DUBBED
     version of GOLDFINGER.

     The door bangs open and Rath springs off the bed, a gun
     flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking
     Electra.

     Rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the GUN CLICK
     back into place.

                             RATH
               You should knock.

                             ELECTRA
               Sorry.

                             RATH
               How was the beach?

                             ELECTRA
               The beach?  It was nice.

     She smiles.


     EXT. HOTEL PARAISO - DUSK

     The sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows
     of the hotel.


     INT. HOTEL ROOM

     Electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall.
     In her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is
     looking over the top of, staring intensely across the
     room.

     We can hear Rath, his breathing deep and even.  He is
     doing Tai Chi, wearing only his boxer shorts.  His body is
     coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he
     moves fluidly through space.

     Electra begins to breath with him.

     She moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to
     meet his.

     He empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, his
     eyes closed, rested.

                             ELECTRA
               That was beautiful.

     He looks at her.

                             ELECTRA
               Tai Chi, right?

     He nods.

                             ELECTRA
               Where did you learn it?

                             RATH
               Taiwan.

                             ELECTRA
               Not that I would know, but you look
               like you're really good at it.

                             RATH
               Thank you.

                             ELECTRA
               I've always wanted to learn
               something like that.

                             RATH
               You should.  It's very important,
               that the body release the energy
               that builds in it.

     Electra nods, watching him bend, reaching for a change of
     clothes.

                             RATH
               I'm going to shower.  If you're
               hungry, go ahead and order some
               dinner.

     Electra nods again.


     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT

     Bain is doing push ups.  He is naked except for his
     camouflage bikinis.

     He has his feet up on a chair, making it harder, the dip
     deeper.

     His body is gushing sweat, his face a burning red.

     He is like a piston firing up and down.  The muscles in
     his neck and shoulders are bulging cords.

     Slowly, his arm begin to tire, the strain seen in his
     knotting and twisting expression.

     Half way up, he collapses, feet falling off the chair.

     He rolls onto his back, rubbing a tricep.  It hurts.  He
     licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

     Rath checks his watch.  It's after eight o'clock.  He
     lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem.

                             RATH
               I'm going to call.

     Electra drops her book and climbs off the bed.

     He dials, types the code and waits.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Hello, Robert.

                             RATH/SCREEN
               The contract?

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Paid in full.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh, my God.  Ten million dollars.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Transferred to the specified
               account.

     Rath stares at the screen.

                             CONTRACTOR/SCREEN
               Goodbye, Robert.

     Rath disconnects.  The PHONE HUMS.

     Electra picks it up, placing it back in the cradle.

                             RATH
               Sit down.

     She does.

     He opens a case and pulls out his gun, some paper and pens
     and two small mikes that look like hearing aids.

                             RATH
               Okay --

     He starts drawing several squares on the paper, as Electra
     picks up the mike.  She looks over it, frowns.

                             ELECTRA
               Two way?

                             RATH
               Transmits and receives.

                             ELECTRA
               Cheap as shit.

     He looks at her.

                             RATH
               I paid a lot for these.

                             ELECTRA
               They saw you coming a mile away.  If
               I had known we'd be using --

                             RATH
               It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have
               to deal with these.

                             ELECTRA
               Fine.

     He goes back to his drawing.

                             RATH
               This is the bank.  This is the
               hotel.  In the morning I will enter
               the bank.

                             ELECTRA
               Check.

                             RATH
               He will be hidden somewhere out
               here, probably somewhere low, in the
               crowd.  He'll stay there until he
               sees me enter the bank.

                             ELECTRA
               But he won't shoot you right then?

                             RATH
               No.  It would be amateur.  A risk.
               He'll wait for the prime shot, that
               he knows is coming.  Once I'm
               inside, he'll move to the hotel.
               He'll go up the back, too much
               traffic in the front.

     He draws another square.

                             RATH
               You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A
               public place far enough away that he
               won't notice you, but with a good
               enough view you'll be able to see
               him when he moves inside.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay.  Then what?

                             RATH
               Then, we wait.

                             ELECTRA
               Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know
               if I like this plan.

                             RATH
               It will take the entire day, but he
               will begin to doubt himself.  He
               will begin to believe that he missed
               me, that somehow I slipped by and am
               already on a plane to Europe.

     He describes this as though remembering it.

                             RATH
               The sun will be low, almost dark,
               the air cool and the bank will
               almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He
               will put the rifle down, he will get
               up and he will walk across the plaza
               to the bank.

                             ELECTRA
               Why won't he wait until the bank
               closes?

                             RATH
               He won't be able to.  He'll have to
               go inside.  He'll have to see with
               his own eyes, whether or not I am
               there.  If the bank closes, he won't
               know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm
               sure.  And when he does you'll go
               into the hotel, go upstairs and take
               the gun.

                             ELECTRA
               What?  What if he brings it with
               him?

     He shakes his head.

                             RATH
               He can't.  The bank has an expensive
               security system; metal detectors and
               X-ray machines.

                             ELECTRA
               That means you won't have a gun.

                             RATH
               That's right.

                             ELECTRA
               And with the mikes, I'll tell you
               when he leaves the hotel and you'll
               tell me when he leaves the bank.

                             RATH
               If things go well, I don't have to.
               You'll already be in a rented car
               waiting for me.

                             ELECTRA
               You'll have the money.  How do I
               know that you won't --

                             RATH
               I'll be walking out of the bank,
               unarmed.  You'll have the gun and
               I'll drive the car.

                             ELECTRA
               We split the money?

                             RATH
               Five million apiece.  You get on
               your plane, I get on mine.

                             ELECTRA
               Sounds pretty well figured out.

                             RATH
               I've been thinking about it for a
               long time.

                             ELECTRA
               Except --

                             RATH
               What?

                             ELECTRA
               Except, if he doesn't come out of
               the hotel.

                             RATH
               I told you, he will.

                             ELECTRA
               You can't know for sure, how can
               you?  I mean, you're not him.

                             RATH
               I was.

     She waits for him to explain.

                             RATH
               Ten years ago, I sat there in that
               same hotel window, sweat pouring off
               of me waiting --

                             ELECTRA
               For Nicholai?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               You killed him here?  In this city,
               outside that bank?

     Rath nods.

                             ELECTRA
               What is it?  I don't like this at
               all.  What is going on here?

                             RATH
               I don't know.  It just happened.  I
               was here ten years ago, I'm here
               now.  That's it.

                             ELECTRA
               I don't believe that.

                             RATH
               It wasn't planned or premeditated.
               I swear.  Things happened beyond my
               control.  I understood; I saw where
               they were leading and I suppose that
               it just made sense.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten years ago.

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               What happened?

                             RATH
               I waited until I was insane and then
               I walked into the bank.  He was
               sitting there, very calm, waiting
               for me.

                             ELECTRA
               What did he want?

                             RATH
               He wanted what I want now; to get
               out of the business.  To disappear
               to some empty Greek island.

                             RATH
               What did he say?

                             RATH
               He said I couldn't win.  That no one
               wins at this game.

                             ELECTRA
               Was that it?

                             RATH
               Then he offered me one million
               dollars to walk away, to quit the
               business.

                             ELECTRA
               You didn't take it.

                             RATH
               No.  I went back to the hotel.  And
               waited.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten years later, here you are again.

                             RATH
               Yes.  Here I am again.


     POV - THROUGH TELESCOPIC LENS - MARBLE STATUE

     The cross-hairs of a telescopic sight are lined-up on the
     head of a marble statue.


     INT. COSTA BLANCA HOTEL - NIGHT

     Bain is laying on the floor in the dark.  The rifle is
     under him as he aims out of his balcony, down the street
     at the statue.

     He looks up from the scope, checking the street.  It is
     dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight.

     His finger squeezes, the GUN ALMOST SILENT, as --

     INTERCUT WITH:

     STATUE

     A chunk of STONE EXPLODES out the head of the statue.
     Again, the GUN SPITS and another cloud of dust and ROCK
     BURSTS from the head.  His finger is pumping the trigger,
     until the head cracks and falls.

     He's laughing, hysterical, looking down the street at the
     headless statue.

     He rolls onto his side still laughing.  Then, suddenly, he
     stops, staring up at the stars in the night sky.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO ROOM - NIGHT

     Electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, in
     another world.

     Rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her.

                             ELECTRA
               This has been the longest day of my
               life.

     Rath nods, pouring himself a drink.  Electra looks at the
     drink, downs the whole glass.  He refills it.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you have ulcers?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               I think I got one today.

                             RATH
               Five million dollars will buy a lot
               of Rolaids.

     She smiles.  They both gulp down their drinks and he fills
     them again.

                             ELECTRA
               What do you suppose he's doing now?

     Rath shrugs.  He is no longer looking at her; staring at
     the board, moving his mind into the chess game.

     She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the
     way a child does, almost imitating him.  She does not want
     to be left alone right now.

     She reaches over and moves a white knight.

     He blinks.  His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities.

     He picks a bishop and counters.

     After another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes
     his knight.

                             RATH
               Why did you trade a bishop for a
               knight?

                             ELECTRA
               I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I
               like knights.

                             RATH
               They're worth less points.

                             ELECTRA
               So?

     There is no point in arguing.

     As they continue to play, we begin to hear in the
     distance, the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very
     vigorous LOVE.

     Electra watches Rath to see if he hears them.  He shows no
     sign of it, concentrating on the game.

                             ELECTRA
               Do you hear them?

     He looks up.

                             ELECTRA
               Listen.

     He hears it.  Not interested.

                             ELECTRA
               Did you think they were newlyweds?

                             RATH
               I didn't notice them.

                             ELECTRA
               When I first saw them I thought they
               were married.

                             RATH
               How do you know they're not?

                             ELECTRA
               I went into their room this
               afternoon.

                             RATH
               What?

                             ELECTRA
               It was no big deal.  I saw them
               leave, I went in.

                             RATH
               Jesus, if someone had --

                             ELECTRA
               Nobody ever sees me.   

                             RATH
               Why in the hell would you take that
               chance?

                             ELECTRA
               I heard them last night and it made
               me want to know something about
               them.  I wanted to, so I did.

     Rath shakes his head.  In the b.g., the WOMAN is ALMOST
     SCREAMING.

                             ELECTRA
               She is married, but not to him.
               Another man, much older.  She has
               four kids.  The young guy works for
               her.  And I think she likes kinky
               sex.

                             RATH
               Thank you.

                             ELECTRA
               Isn't it interesting though?  I
               mean, look at us, in this room.  Or
               yesterday, when we were walking in
               the plaza market.  I mean, we look
               like just another couple.  But what
               are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               No?

                             RATH
               It's always been that way.  The
               world has always functioned on two
               levels.

                             ELECTRA
               I know.  It makes me crazy.

                             RATH
               Why?

                             ELECTRA
               I don't know.  When I was in
               college, I was forced to go to a
               psychiatrist because I was caught
               drilling holes in my dorm room
               floor.

                             RATH
               And you were drilling these
               holes...?

                             ELECTRA
               So I could watch the girl that lived
               under me.

                             RATH
               Apparently this doctor was unable to
               cure you.

                             ELECTRA
               He told me that my curiosity became
               unnaturally entangled with my sense
               of self-preservation.

                             RATH
               Did he explain how this happened?

                             ELECTRA
               He believed it all went back to one
               night, when as a little girl.  I
               watched my parents have this big
               fight, really big.  I thought my
               mother was going to kill my father.
               Then they went into their room and
               made up.  And I watched them make
               love through the keyhole.

     The WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX.

     Electra moves her queen, taking his other knight.

                             RATH
               What are you doing?

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               That's a ridiculous move.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Because, I'll take it.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm playing white, remember.  You
               can't tell me which pieces to move.
               It doesn't work that way.

     He shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing.

                             ELECTRA
               Can I ask you something?

                             RATH
               I'm sure you will.

                             ELECTRA
               Am I attractive?

     This gets his attention.

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Are you attracted to me?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Why?

                             RATH
               Why?  I don't know.

                             ELECTRA
               Is it a physical thing, or a mental
               thing?

                             RATH
               Both.

     A good answer.  Electra smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               Is that why you didn't want to talk
               about women before?

                             RATH
               I didn't want to complicate the
               situation.

                             ELECTRA
               Attraction is a complication?

                             RATH
               It can be.

                             ELECTRA
               It happened to you before?

                             RATH
               Yes.

                             ELECTRA
               Who was she?

                             RATH
               Someone like me, like you.  A pro.

                             ELECTRA
               What happened to her?

                             RATH
               She was taken.

                             ELECTRA
               Did you --

                             RATH
               No.  I tried to stop it.  I
               couldn't.

                             ELECTRA
               Was she the only one?

                             RATH
               After her, I realized that to
               survive I had to live without...
               It's dangerous to let things become
               complicated.

                             ELECTRA
               Is this becoming complicated?

                             RATH
               I'm not sure that I care anymore.

     He looks up from the game.

                             ELECTRA
               Were you attracted to me right away?

                             RATH
               No.

                             ELECTRA
               When did it start?

                             RATH
               Honestly?

                             ELECTRA
               Uh-huh.

                             RATH
               When I gave you my gun and you
               almost shot me.

                             ELECTRA
               Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

                             RATH
               Why?

                             ELECTRA
               That doesn't sound normal.

                             RATH
               I'm not normal.

                             ELECTRA
               I know.  That's why I'm attracted to
               you.  I mean, you make me nervous.
               You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my
               curiosity/self-preservation thing,
               but all I can really think about
               right now is kissing you.

     They rise up from the table, together, knocking over the
     chess game.  The pieces fall to the floor.

     They grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry,
     aggressive.  They tear at each other's clothes and at
     their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as
     they become naked in front of each other.  There is
     nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very
     real.

     He takes her, lifting her onto the table.

     She scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out
     of the way.

     She opens her legs and he moves in between them.

                             ELECTRA
               I wanted to tell you --

     Her breath rushes out, then back in.

                             ELECTRA
               My real name is Anna.

     He smiles.

                             RATH
               Martin.

                             ELECTRA
               Martin.

     Her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into
     her.

                             ELECTRA
               Nice to meet you, Martin.


     INT. HOTEL PARAISO - HALL - NIGHT

     Outside of the room, we can hear the MUFFLED SOUNDS of TWO
     PEOPLE MAKING LOVE.


     EXT. COSTA BLANCA - NIGHT

     We are MOVING DOWN the street, LOW, OVER the old
     flagstones, TOWARDS the marble statue that Bain shot.

     On the ground are the shattered pieces of the head.

     CLOSER

     We see one of the pieces is part of the face, the eyes,
     which seem like the iris-less eyes of a chess king.

     CLOSER

     We MOVE INTO the blank white of that eye.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     WHITE SQUARE GLOSSED WITH LIGHT

     We PULL BACK, RISING UP and AWAY, and see other squares,
     black and white like a chess board.

     A woman's HIGH HEELS CLICK past.

     RISING HIGHER, we see the woman walking.  A man crosses
     behind her, in another direction.

     HIGHER STILL, and we realize that we are looking at the
     black and white marble floor of the --


     INT. INTERNATIONAL BANCO DE MEXICO - DAY

     It is a strange and beautiful bank.

     The ceilings are vast, the suspended lights elaborate,
     baroque, the enormous clock on the wall, built to resemble
     a sun.

     It looks almost as though it could be a museum, with its
     massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important
     Mexican figures.

     Already it is crowded, people and security guards moving
     about beneath us.

     Rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers.


     EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE

     The cafe is off the plaza.

     Electra sits at a patio table.  Down the street she can
     see the back of the burned-out hotel.

     She hears Rath in her ear-piece.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               All right.  I'm in the bank.  He'll
               move now.  How are you doing?

     She is nervous.

                             ELECTRA
               I'm ready.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               Good.

     Rath is wearing a well-tailored, gray silk suit and dark
     sunglasses.  In his hand is a very large briefcase.  He
     crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows.

                             TELLER
               May I help you?

                             RATH
               Yes.  Could you check on a transfer
               for me?

                             TELLER
               Your name, or account?

                             RATH
               Rath.  Robert Rath.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra smiles when she hears him, mouthing the name
     "Martin."


     INT. BANK

     A BANK OFFICIAL walks over to the window, carrying a
     printed receipt, with a very bright smile.

                             OFFICIAL
               Senor Rath, we have received your
               transfer.

     He hands Rath the receipt.  He glances at it, checking the
     zeros.  There are seven of them.

                             RATH
               Good.  Now I'll need to close this
               account.  I'd like you to ready the
               paperwork.

     The smile fades.

                             OFFICIAL
               You wish to close this account
               today?

                             RATH
               That's correct.

                             OFFICIAL
               How would you like the funds?

                             RATH
               American currency.

                             OFFICIAL
               This will take some time.

                             RATH
               I have all day.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra looks up over her book and Bain is there, moving
     down the side street, gliding through the crowd with the
     menacing indifference of a shark.


     INT. BANK

     The Official is talking to the teller in Spanish, when
     Electra whispers in Rath's ear.

                             ELECTRA
               He's here.

     Rath freezes.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall,
     covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out
     of the burned hotel.  He is carrying a long nylon duffel
     bag.

     At the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled
     loose and Bain squeezes through, into the hotel.

                             ELECTRA
               He's inside.


     INT. BANK

     Rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs
     set in pairs along the wall of the bank.

     He glances at the enormous clock, which reads 10:10.  He
     checks his Rolex.

                             RATH
               Now, we wait.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL PARAISO

     The center of the hotel is open.  Interior hall balconies,
     which line each floor, look down onto an old atrium
     courtyard.  The fire did the most damage here, spreading
     easily throughout the entire building.

     The skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area, has
     been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing
     broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened
     floors and walls.

     Bain enters, and carefully begins climbing the charred
     staircase to the fifth floor.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     The room has been heavily burned, stained black from
     smoke.  The charred carpet crunches and cracks, as Bain
     walks across it to the window.

     As he nears the exterior wall, several FLOOR BOARDS BREAK
     with a brittle SNAP and he almost falls through.

                             BAIN
               Shit.

     He pulls his leg free.

     Outside the window, across the plaza, he sees the bank; a
     perfect site.

     Quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun.

     He grabs a magazine and snaps it into place.

     He aims down at the bank's bright white stairs.  A man is
     walking down the steps and Bain finds the center of his
     forehead in the cross-hairs of the scope.

     Bain makes a gun noise, followed by the sound of a head
     bursting open.

     He giggles.

     Leaning against the wall, in the shadows of the window,
     the gun in his lap, he waits.

     Time slows to a crawl.

     Without taking his eye from the bank, Bain rummages
     through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes.  He pulls
     one out with his lips and lights it.

     Taking a deep drag, he lets the smoke slowly leak out and
     drift up into the night.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     SUN

     White hot.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     There are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened
     window sill, where Bain extinguishes another.

                             BAIN
               What in the fuck are you doing in
               there?

     The room is hot, a streak of sweat up his back and front.
     It is difficult to breathe.

     A man walks out of the bank, wearing a suit similar to
     Rath's.  Bain's body snaps erect, rifle instantly leveled.

     He sights the man's head, his finger tightening on the
     trigger, but he is not sure it is Rath.

     He looks over the scope, looks back.  The man reaches the
     bottom of the stairs.  Bain's body sags.

                             BAIN
               That's not him.  Jesus, Bain, baby,
               chill the fuck out.

     He takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his
     forehead, leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood.

     He again fumbles through his bag, finding a container of
     bottled water.  He chugs the whole thing.


     INT. BANK

     The Official walks over to Rath with a number of papers to
     sign.

                             OFFICIAL
               Your signature, senor.  Everything
               is ready.

     Rath signs them, but does not get up.

                             OFFICIAL
               Excellent, senor.  If you could
               follow me?

                             RATH
               I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an
               associate.  Can you hold everything
               for me until he arrives?

                             OFFICIAL
               Of course, senor.

                             RATH
               Thank you.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought
     of all that money.

                             ELECTRA
               Ten million dollars, sitting there.
               Waiting... this is insane.


     INT. BANK

     There is a faint smile on Rath's lips.


     EXT. PLAZA

     The shadows are getting longer.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     Bain is rocking back and forth, breathing through his
     teeth.  He has to urinate.  Bad.

     He is checking every face that comes out of the bank with
     the scope.  Still nothing.

                             BAIN
               This is fucking insane.

     He grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and
     begins refilling it.

     A man in a suit appears on the steps and Bain fumbles the
     bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun.  It is not Rath.

                             BAIN
               Fucking God dammit!

     He hurls the bottle of piss across the room.


     INT. BANK

     The sun clock on the wall, perfectly still, reads 5:20.
     After a long beat a single minute clicks off.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     The sun is getting low.  The room much darker now.

     Bain sits at the window; his body a knot.

     A large group of tourists flow out of the bank and Bain's
     eyes light up.  One by one, the scope passes over each
     face.

     They trickle down the steps and into the plaza.

     The stairs are again empty.

     Bain screams, pounding the butt of the gun down, splitting
     open the floor.

     He looks at the bank.  Nothing.  He checks his watch.  In
     fifteen minutes the bank will close.

     He stands up.


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain
     emerges from the shadows.

                             ELECTRA
               Oh my God.

     He is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don't
     get out of his way.

                             ELECTRA
               He's coming.


     INT. BANK

     Rath looks up at the clock, smiles.

                             RATH
               Four minutes.

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               I waited another four minutes.

                             ELECTRA
               Shit.

                             RATH
               Wait until he is on the stairs.

                             ELECTRA
               Right.

                             RATH
               I'm taking off my mike.

                             ELECTRA
               Okay.

                             RATH
               Electra --

                             ELECTRA
               What?

                             RATH
               Last night --


     EXT. CAFE

     Electra smiles.

                             ELECTRA
               Was nice.

                             RATH
               Yes.

     She sees Bain storming up the stairs.  She stands, tosses
     several bills on the table and leaves.


     INT. BANK

     Bain charges into the bank, tearing off his sunglasses,
     scanning the room.  His face is a twisted grimace,
     streaked with black charcoal.  His body and clothes are
     covered in sweat and large salt rings.  His breathing
     labored.

     He sees Rath sitting comfortably, calm, his suit not even
     wrinkled and realizes that Rath has been waiting for him.

     His first instinct is to turn and run, but he stops
     himself.  He is confused, unsure.

     Then, as though understanding he has no choice, he puts
     his sunglasses back on and strides over to Rath, BOOTS
     CLICKING against the polished MARBLE.

     Bain sits down in the leather chair across from him.

                             BAIN
               How'd you know?  Just tell me that.
               How'd you fucking know?

                             RATH
               I knew the same way in ten years
               you're going to know.

                             BAIN
               What does that fucking mean?

                             RATH
               It means that I'm going to tell you
               things, even though I already know
               that you're not going to listen to a
               God damned thing I say.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor, then
     navigates around a large hole, towards the last room.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               It's irony.  That's what it is.  But
               the real irony is that you won't
               know it's irony until you're sitting
               over here.

     Bain isn't listening.  Instead he's watching, everyone who
     walks near them.

                             RATH
               When you walked in here and you saw
               me, sitting here, waiting; the first
               thing that went through your head
               was that you were a dead man.

     This catches Bain's ear.

                             RATH
               You're thinking that you've been
               sold out.  That's the only way I
               could know you were out there.  Why
               would you think this?  Because you
               don't trust your contractor.  You
               don't trust anyone.  It's automatic.
               It's the first and last commandment.
               It's the only thing that keeps you
               alive.  So, try as I might to tell
               you the truth, you can't believe me.
               Do you see the irony of the
               situation?  It's kind of funny,
               isn't it?

     Bain is not laughing.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL ROOM

     Inside the burned out closet, Electra finds Bain's nylon
     duffel bag.

     Digging through it, she finds his Gameboy, his Walkman,
     his .22, ammunition clips and several issues of Soldier of
     Fortune and a Punisher comic book.

     The rifle is not here.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago,
               you contacted your contractor, who
               told you that they knew when and
               where I was going to pick up the
               transferred money from MicroCell.
               You don't know how they got the
               information.  It bothered you, but
               you didn't care.  How do I know
               this?  Because ten years ago, I was
               sitting in that chair, as scared
               shitless as you are now.

                             BAIN
               I ain't scared of you.

                             RATH
               Yeah you are and you hate it.  You
               hate the fact that your hand is
               shaking and mine isn't.  That you're
               sweating your balls off and I'm not.
               You've got fear and hate in your
               belly like battery acid, all because
               of me.

                             BAIN
               If you think you can take me, quit
               fucking bullshitting and try it.

                             RATH
               All right, Bain.  Pay attention,
               because this is where everything
               changes.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is beginning to panic.  She cannot find the gun
     and has started looking in other rooms.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               You're a businessman, right?  This
               is a business deal.  Behind that
               counter, I have over ten million
               dollars.  I'll give you half of it,
               more money than you'll make in the
               next ten years if, you walk away.

     Bain's face changes, muscles relaxing, the tension
     slipping out of him.

                             BAIN
               Five million dollars?

                             RATH
               That's right.

                             BAIN
               Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.

     Bain is smiling.

                             RATH
               Did you see how I did that?  Magic
               wasn't it?

                             BAIN
               What?

                             RATH
               You understand what's going on?  It
               makes sense, right?

                             BAIN
               Oh, yeah.

                             RATH
               What I just said, no assassin would
               say.  What I've said, only a mark
               would say.

     They stare at each other.

                             BAIN
               You think I would be an idiot to
               pass up five million dollars.

                             RATH
               You would be.

                             BAIN
               You don't know a fucking thing about
               me.  You don't have the slightest
               fucking clue.

                             RATH
               Why don't you tell me.

                             BAIN
               I'll tell you this.  After
               Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to
               be alive.  But now, here, I just
               realized that you were the lucky
               one.

                             RATH
               Now I'll tell you something.  It
               wouldn't fucking matter if I offered
               you one hundred million dollars.
               You'd still be thinking the same
               thing, that you're going to take me.
               And here I am, sitting through this,
               knowing it's bullshit, looking at
               you and the only thing going on in
               my mind, the only thing I can think
               is that, in just a few minutes I'm
               going to take you.

     Bain jumps out of the seat.

                             BAIN
               Yeah, okay!  I'm ready!  Let's
               fucking go!

     He's walking, turning, watching everything, everyone.
     He's out the door.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is on the fourth level, searching desperately for
     the gun, rushing through the black skeletal remains of the
     hotel.

     In her ear she hears Rath.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               Electra?

     She shrieks.


     INT. BANK

     Rath is at the counter, as the Official loads perfectly
     stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the
     case.

                             RATH
               Electra?


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra is frantic.

                             ELECTRA
               God, I can't find it!  I can't find
               it!  I can't find the fucking gun!


     INT. BANK

     For Rath, everything has changed.


     EXT. PLAZA

     In long, pounding strides, Bain crosses the square,
     twisting, glancing back, watching.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra nears the room below the fifth story window.

                             ELECTRA
               It wasn't with his other stuff!


     INT. BANK

     Rath is now afraid.

                             RATH
               Electra, get out.


     EXT. SIDE STREET

     Bain nears the opening in the plywood wall.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black
     plumbing pipe and charred lathe.  It hangs in the space
     between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               He's coming, Electra!  Get out now!

                             ELECTRA
               Oh, God.  I see it!

     She reaches for it, but it's too high.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               Electra, listen!  You have got to
               come to the bank for the money!  The
               money!

     She is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back
     toward the stairs.

     Just as she grabs the rail, she hears BAIN STORMING INTO
     THE LOBBY below.

     She begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly.

     Bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs.


     INT. BANK

     The bank is almost empty.  Rath has begun to sweat.

                             RATH
               Electra!

     The Official looks at him strangely, stacking the last of
     the green paper blocks.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra peeks over the rail to see Bain right behind her.

                             RATH (V.O.)
               Electra!

     The voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off,
     stuffing it in her pocket.


     INT. BANK

                             RATH
               Electra, what's happening?  What are
               you --

     The Official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut.

                             OFFICIAL
               Finido, senor.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Electra turns into the hotel room just as Bain reaches the
     fifth floor.  There is no time.
     
     She slips into the closet, as Bain whips around the corner
     into the room.  He rushes to the window, slamming himself
     against it.

                             BAIN
               You're gonna take me?  Come on!
               Come on, motherfucker!

     He bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls
     out the assault rifle.

                             BAIN
               Take this!  Take this, you fuck!

     Electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood
     lathe.

     He pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through
     the wall.

                             BAIN
               Motherfucker!

     He stands suddenly, perfectly still, gun aimed at the
     bank.

                             BAIN
               Comeon-comeon-comeone-it'sover-
               gameover-comeon.


     INT. BANK

     The sun clock reads six o'clock.

     There is no one left in the bank except for employees and
     guards.

     The Official is at Rath's elbow leading him towards the
     metal gates.

                             OFFICIAL
               We are closed, senor.  Thank you for
               banking with us.

     It is happening as it happened ten years ago.  Rath knows
     that he is unable to stop it.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain is rigid, cast in iron, the rifle rammed under his
     chin, sight tight to his eye, finger wrapped around the
     trigger.

     Electra silently, ever so delicately opens her bag,
     lifting out her gun.

                             BAIN
               Make me shit, you sorry ass piece of
               mark meat!  Come on, come on.  It's
               over!  I know it!  You know it!  We
               know it!

     In the...


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     we watch Rath step out of the bank, the doors closing
     behind him.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Bain smiles.


     INSIDE CLOSET

     Electra slowly rises, still watching Bain.


     EXT. PLAZA

     The sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep
     orange and auburn cast.

     Rath looks down at the descending, white, stone steps.

     He steps down to the first stair.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

                             BAIN
               Lift your head, motherfucker.

     Electra is standing.  The gun clenched in her shaking
     hand.

                             BAIN
               Look up here.


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     The cross-hairs are an "X" on Rath's head.


     BACK TO SCENE

                             BAIN
               Look up.  Look at me.  I want to see
               your face.


     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath looks across the square, up the side of the hotel, at
     the window; there is only black shadow.

     He knows it is over.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

                             BAIN
               Yes.

     Electra shoves open the door, leveling the gun --

     As Bain turns.

                             BAIN
               Wha --

     She FIRES.

     His shoulder explodes, blood spraying the black wall.


     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath hears BAIN SCREAM.

                             RATH
               Electra.

     His eyes, his whole body comes to life.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain is twisting in mid-air, diving as --

     She FIRES again, moving at him.  A chunk of WOOD EXPLODES
     as she misses.

     He falls, the burned FLOOR SHATTERING, charred JOISTS
     SHEARING with the sound of BREAKING GLASS.

     She watches him fall through, hears him HIT the FLOOR
     below, ASH and WOOD CLATTERING around him.

     The gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but
     he is gone.


     EXT. PLAZA

     Rath races wildly across the darkening market square.


     INT. BURNED HOTEL

     Bain, lying on his back, aims the rifle at her FOOTSTEPS.

                             BAIN
               Die, bitch!

     He FIRES, finger pumping, BULLETS ERUPTING through the
     floor around her feet.

     Screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall.

     His shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and
     rises, listening as --

     She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall.

     Beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the
     staircase, waiting, until --

     Electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that
     they are exposed.

     She flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is
     PERFORATED with BULLETS.

                             BAIN
               Fuck!  God damn bitch!  What are you
               doing?  I don't believe this is
               happening!

     She can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the
     hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall,
     above; there is nowhere to go.

                             BAIN
               You're dead!  You're fucking dead!
               I'm going to kill you a hundred
               fucking times for this!

     Bain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through
     the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves
     he'll know her position.

     He FIRES another.

     Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at
     the floor.

     Another SHOT.

     She FIRES back.

     Bain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS,
     flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets.

     Her gun empties first.

     He laughs hearing the CLICK.

                             BAIN
               Game over, bitch!

                             RATH
               Bain!

     Rath's scream ECHOES up through the building.

     Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a
     ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light
     from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and
     broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream-
     like grid resembling a chess board.

     Electra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing
     the gun over the balcony.

     The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she
     races back to the room.

                             BAIN
               Fuck no!

     Rath grabs the gun tracking Bain hurling up the stairs to
     the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun
     is empty.

                             RATH
               Shit!

     Bain reaches the top of the stairs before Electra gets to
     the end of the hall.

     Rath sees it all happening.

                             RATH
               Electra!

     Bain snaps into a targeting stance.

     Electra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly
     touching the floor --


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     When the cross-hairs find her back.


     BACK TO SCENE

                             RATH
               Electra!

     Time becomes syrup.

                             RATH
               Down!  Get down!

     Bain FIRES.

     Electra dives.

     The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her.

     She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room.

     Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the
     stairs.

     Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and
     FIRES, the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back
     down into the shadows.

     Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22.

     Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door.

     Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out
     the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the
     ground and bursts open.

     A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest
     in the middle of the courtyard.

     Rath and Bain both see it.

     Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it.

     Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then
     back at the door.  Something's got to give.

     Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between
     her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door.

     Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502.

     Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a
     slow breath and tears from the shadows --

     Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip,
     the ground a blur beneath him --

     Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath.

     Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip
     as --

     The RIFLE SPITS --

     Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood.


     TELESCOPIC SIGHT

     The scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Rath rams the clip in place.

                             BAIN
               Game --

     Bain squeezes the trigger --

     CLICK -- the rifle is empty.  Bain screams in disbelief.

     Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the
     balcony but Bain is gone.

     Electra searches the room for a way out.  Keeping the gun
     trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole
     that Bain fell through.

     Grimacing, Rath struggles to his feet.

                             RATH
               Electra!

     Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster
     flying.

     Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN,
     swallowing her.

     Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH.

     Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the
     open ceiling.

                             RATH
               The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid
               of it!  Throw it!

     She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared.  She
     looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands.

     His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall.

     Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to
     the fourth level through another burned opening.

     Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at
     every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain,
     a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her.

     Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the
     door to room 502.

     Hearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he
     snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls.

     Rath hears her scream.

     Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her
     to the ground.

     She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face,
     jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious.

     Bain grabs the gun.

     Rath whips into the room BLASTING --

     BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened
     hole.

     Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead.
     Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared
     with blood.

     From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               Hey!  Tell me something, Bobby-boy.

     Electra comes to, her eyes blinking open.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               Are you still thinking that you're
               going to take me?

     Electra is trying to focus, as Rath listens to the voice,
     searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from
     everywhere.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               No, I don't think you are.  You know
               what I think?

     The voice is closer.  Rath wipes the stinging sweat from
     his eyes.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               I think you're thinking what I'm
               thinking.

     Still dizzy, Electra taps her fist against Rath's chest.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               You know what I'm thinking,
               Bobby-boy?!

     It seems as though Bain is in the room.

                             BAIN (O.S.)
               You know what I'm thinking?!

     Electra opens her fist and inside Rath sees the handful of
     bullets from the other gun.

     Bain whirls INTO VIEW, his gun whipping around to Rath who
     turns too slow.

     Bain pumps the trigger.  ONE CLICK.  ANOTHER.  And
     ANOTHER.  The gun is empty.

                             RATH
               Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

     He levels his gun.

                             RATH
               Game over.

     Rath FIRES, OVER and OVER, emptying the GUN into Bain's
     head and chest, even as he crashes through the balcony
     railing and falls, twisting through lightless space,
     slamming to the stone floor dead.


     EXT. PLAZA DEL SOL - NIGHT

     The sun is gone, the market is closing, the crowd drifting
     from the plaza.

     A man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley
     beside the boarded hotel.  Although they walk a bit slow,
     leaning on one another, they become it seems, like just
     another couple, arm in arm, holding tightly to each other
     and to a very large suitcase.

                                                 FADE OUT.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS (STOCK FOTTAGE) - NIGHT

               GRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA

               It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

               The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized 
               conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, 
               including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket 
               and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

               ANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED 
               HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY

               CAT.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face always unseen)
                         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  
                         As you know, my plot to high-jack 
                         nuclear weapons and hold the world 
                         hostage has failed.  Again.  This 
                         organization will not tolerate 
                         failure.

               He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic 
               doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip

               back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and 
               smoking.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mustafa...

               ANGLE ON:  MUSTAFA, an Arab with a red Fez.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Frau Farbissina...

               ANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA in a severe Salvation Army uniform.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I spared your lives because I need 
                         you to help me rid the world of the 
                         only man who can stop me now.  We 
                         must go to London.  I've set a trap 
                         for Austin Powers!

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

               We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet 
               pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night 
               Fever.

               We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of 
               Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

               medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National 
               Health Services glasses.

               Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is 
               that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

               Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to 
               a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

               Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO 
               BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all 
               start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

               (PRODUCTION NOTE:  ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR 
               FREEZE FRAMES À LA SWEET CHARITY.)

               In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently 
               to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

               One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a 
               metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears 
               a see-through Mary Quant dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (taking photos)
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me baby.  Smashing!

               We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in 
               the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder.  
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No.  No.

               Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm 
               spent.

               Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT 
               scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get these off to Fab Magazine right 
                         away.

                                     SUPERMODEL 1
                         Austin, you've really outdone yourself 
                         this time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks, baby.

                                     SUPERMODEL 2
                              (suggestively)
                         We could have another photo session 
                         back at my flat.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (coyly)
                         Oh, behave!

                                     SUPERMODEL 3
                         Austin, I love you!

                                     AUSTIN
                         So many women, so little time.

               A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site.  They 
               recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

                                     MOD GIRL 1
                         It's Austin Powers!

               Austin runs away.  The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's 
               Night.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Two BAD GUYS attack Austin.  He JUDO CHOPS them.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               The mob of girls catches up to Austin and he runs away.

               EXT.  PHONE BOOTH

               Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned.  The mob 
               runs by.  He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

               EXT.  GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY

               Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
               face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention 
               just outside his guard box.

               Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up, 
               but to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER 
               from behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They 
               both crack up.

               EXT.  PHOTO BOOTH

               The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody 
               inside.  Austin steps out.

               ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP

               Panels 1-3 show Austin with various exotic MODELS.  The fourth 
               panel shows Austin with the QUEEN.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that 
               says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You might want to protest a bit louder 
                         next time, luv.

               The both laugh.

               2L  FULL SCREEN INSERT - AUSTIN'S PASSPORT

               The passport opens.  We see Austin's dour photo.  Then he 
               gives an insane grin, showing his bad teeth.  The page flips 
               and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.  The blind man, 
               obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin.  Austin 
               wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to 
               knee him the balls.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF 
               SCHOOLGIRLS.

               After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a 
               baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

               The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to 
               run.

               A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a 
               large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

               He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing 
               off just ahead of the crowd.

               EXT./INT.  JAGUAR - STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

               The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, 
               a beautiful woman in her thirties.

               They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING 
                         RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a 
                         distinctive PHONE RING.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief 
                         of British Intelligence.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone.  
               ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a 
               distinguished older man.  A desk plate reads:  "Basil 
               Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence."

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin.  This is Basil 
                         Exposition, Chief of British 
                         Intelligence.

               You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're 
               with Agent

               Mrs. Kensington.  The year is 1967, and you're talking on a 
               picture phone.

                                     AUSTIN
                         We know all that, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I just wanted to be extremely clear 
                         so that everyone knows what's going 
                         on at any given time.  We've just 
                         received word that Dr. Evil, the 
                         ultimate square, is planning to take 
                         over the world.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil?  I thought I put him in 
                         jail for good.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm afraid not.  Earlier this week, 
                         Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel 
                         Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's 
                         planning a trap for you tonight at 
                         the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat 
                         Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus 
                         here in swinging London.

               A panel revolves to reveal a map of London with lights showing 
               Austin's position and the location of the club.

                                     AUSTIN

               The Jaguar pulls up in front of the swinging nightclub.  
               Mrs. Kensington steps out of the car, dressed in a tight 
               leather fightsuit.  She looks fabulous.

               It's a swinging club.  FREAKS abound.  In one corner, there 
               is a PRESS CONFERENCE in progress.

               In one corner ANDY WARHOL sits in front of his multi-colored 
               Elvis (or equivalent).  He body paints a butterfly on the 
               thigh of a MOD GIRL wearing a metallic miniskirt outfit.

                                     ANDY WARHOL
                         Austin Powers?  Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hey, how are you?

                         Hungry.

                         Here, have this can of Campbell's 
                         Tomato Soup.

               Austin hands Andy a can of soup.

                                     ANDY WARHOL
                         I'm going to paint this can of soup 
                         and become famous and not give you 
                         any credit for it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         If you can become famous, everyone 
                         will have their fifteen minutes of 
                         fame, man.

               INT.  ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB

               HER MAJESTY, THE QUEEN is giving Austin a Victoria's Cross 
               like the Lyndon Johnson scene in Forrest Gump.  Behind them, 
               are two COLDSTREAM GUARDS and the DUKE OF EDINBURGH.

                                     QUEEN
                         Austin Powers, Britain owes you a 
                         debt of gratitude.

               Austin gives a cheeky look to Mrs. Kensington.

                                     QUEEN
                         I understand you were wounded.  Where 
                         were you hit?

                                     AUSTIN
                         In the but-tocks.

                                     QUEEN
                         That must be a sight.  I'd kind of 
                         like to see that.

               Austin turns around, drops his pants, and shows his wounded 
               bum (matching Gump's) to the queen.

               The queen walks away.

                                     QUEEN
                              (laughing)
                         Nice buttocks.

               In the line-up we also see FOREST GUMP.  He has to pee very 
               badly.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         We've got to find Dr. Evil!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait, I've got an idea.

               He PUNCHES a PRETTY MOD GIRL in the face, knocking her out 
               cold.

                                     EVERYONE
                         Ohhh!

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Austin, why in God's name did you 
                         strike that woman?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That ain't no woman!  It's a man, 
                         man.  It's one of Dr. Evil's 
                         assassins.

               Austin pulls off the mod girl's wig.  She is a MALE ASSASSIN.  
               The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet.

               Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him.  The assassin 
               hits the ground and pulls out a dagger.  Mrs. Kensington 
               kicks the knife out of his hand and Austin gets him in a 
               head-lock from behind.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where's Doctor Evil?

               ANGLE ON:  A FINGER WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE 
               FINGER PULLS THE TRIGGER OF A SPEAR

               gun.  The assassin falls forward.  A spear protrudes from 
               his back.  Austin sees Dr. Evil as he runs through a door.  
               They give chase.

               INT.  CLUB - BACK ROOM

               They enter.  Dr. Evil climbs into an egg chair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got you again, Dr. Evil!

               The chair fills with a WHITE MIST.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unseen, through mist)
                         Not this time.  Come, Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth!
                              (calling out)
                         See you in the future, Mr. Powers!

               Before the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair.  
               A sign on the egg reads "CRYOGENIC

               FREEZING BEGINNING."

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         My God!  He's freezing himself.

               Austin begins FIRING at the egg chair.  The ceiling opens up 
               and the egg rises through the opening.  Everything begins to 
               RUMBLE.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling.

                         love is dead, and greed and avarice

                         Not too much!

               The hand re-enters and scoops up some of the fish food.

               INT.  M.O.D. - HALLWAY (OUTSIDE CRYOGENIC STORAGE FACILITY)

               Basil Exposition (now aged 30 years), Command Gilmour, and 
               NICOLAI BORSCHEVSKY, a Russian General, put on extreme-weather 
               gear over their uniforms.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had 
                         himself frozen in 1967.  Soon after, 
                         Austin Powers volunteered to have 
                         himself frozen, in the event Dr. 
                         Evil should ever return.  We believe 
                         Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot 
                         to take over the world.  And that, 
                         gentlemen, is why we're here.

               They pass a row of cryogenic holding berths, each containing 
               a naked PERSON in suspended animation, a la Demolition Man.  
               They pass GARY COLEMAN, EVEL KNIEVAL (with cape), and VANILLA 
               ICE, all in suspended animation.  They pass a now-empty berth 
               with a plate that reads "JOHN

               TRAVOLTA."

                                     BORSCHEVSKY
                         Who is this Austin Powers?  Is he a 
                         British operative?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         No, he worked freelance, an 
                         internationally renowned swinging 
                         photographer by day and the ultimate 
                         gentlemen spy by night.

               Finally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His 
               hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face 
               suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His 
               glasses are frosted over.  He is very hairy.

                         beginning.

               Lasers begin to cut Austin out of the ice in one huge cube.

               A ROBOTIC ARM lifts the cube out of the berth and places it 
               into a high-tech melting vat of warm liquid GOO.

               Austin comes to life out of the goo on a draining platform.

                         cleansing beginning.

               INT.  EXAMINATION AREA

               Technicians lead a half-asleep Austin to a screened area, 
               where only his feet and head are visible.  He's washed off 
               with a series of hot-water jets.

                                     FEMALE ANNOUNCER
                              (on PA)
                         Cleansing complete.  Stage Five, 
                         evacuation beginning.

               He's given futuristic inoculations and then led to a screened-
               in toilet area.  We can hear the sound of PEE ENTERING THE 
               BOWL.

               He PEES for a while, then a little longer.

               And then EVEN LONGER STILL.

               The stream seems to be subsiding...then begins STRONGER than 
               ever.

               He is still PEEING.

               Finally, it STOPS.

               He begins PEEING again.

               A little LONGER.

               Then in short staccato BURSTS.

               The it STOPS.  Pause.

               Two DRIPS.

                         Austin Powers is now completed.

               Austin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle à la Dr.

               and monitor electrodes, IV's, and other biological sensors.

                         The shouting is a temporary side-
                         effect of the unfreezing process.

               conservative, business pantsuit.  Her hair is up and she 
               wears glasses.  Austin's breath is taken away.

               She sets down a huge stack of files.

                         My God, Vanessa's got a smashing

                         How do I tell them that because of 
                         the unfreezing process, I have no 
                         inner monologue?

                         just now.

               There is an uncomfortable SILENCE.

                         lot's changed since 1967.

                         with mind-expanding

               drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a 
               pound.

                         My mother's told me all about you.

                         If it's a lie, goddamn her.  It it's 
                         the truth, goddamn me.

                         mine.

                         I don't even know what this is.  
                         This sort of thing ain't my bag, 
                         baby.

               The clerk shows the book to Austin, who is humiliated.

                         sign.  Just to get things moving, 
                         baby.

                         Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward 
                         to working with you, but do me a 
                         favor and stop calling me baby.  You 
                         can address me as Agent Kensington.  
                         We have to leave immediately.  We've 
                         preserved your private jet just as 
                         you left it.  It's waiting at Heathrow 
                         Airport.

               The inside looks like Hugh Heffner's jet&emdash; rust shag 
               carpet, brown walls, and beads.  Austin and Vanessa sit on 
               beanbag chairs.  Vanessa works on her lap top.

                         Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?  How 
                         does a hot chick like you end up 
                         working at the Ministry of Defense?

                                     VANESSA
                         I went to Oxford and excelled in 
                         several subjects, but I ended up 
                         specializing in foreign languages.  
                         I wanted to travel -- see the world.  
                         In my last year I was accepted into 
                         the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies 
                         sector.  I thought I was off on an 
                         exciting career, but my job was to 
                         read everything printed in every 
                         country.  It's very boring.  My whole 
                         day is spent reading wedding 
                         announcements in Farsi.  If I do 
                         well with this case, I finally get 
                         promoted to field operative...

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, 
                         why don't we go into the back and 
                         shag?

                                     VANESSA
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         man, I want to see if my bits and 
                         pieces are still working.

                                     VANESSA

                         Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you 
                         must be a little confused, but we 
                         have a very serious situation at 
                         hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd 
                         concentrate on our mission and give 
                         your libido a rest.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

                         A Chigro?

                              (offended)
                         We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.  
                         It's considered offensive.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's right.  You're supposed to 
                         say 'colored' now, right?
                              (spotting the flight

                         the sexy stews!

               The STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily.  
               One of them is a man and another wears braces.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'?  
                         We're called 'flight attendants' 
                         now, thank you very much.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a 
                         whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.

                         are a few things we need to discuss.  
                         First of all, we're not wearing these.

                         Seems pretty straightforward, don't 
                         you think...listen darling, I think 
                         you're a fabulous bird.  Can I get 
                         your telephone number?

                         Sure, it's easy to remember.
                              (writing on his hand)
                         It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare 
                         the craft for take-off now.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing!  When we land I'll give 
                         you a tinkle on the telling bone.

               The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's 
                         two things I know about life: one, 
                         Americans will never take to soccer.  
                         Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses 
                         love to shag!

               They're shag-mad, man!  Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, 
               and be honest.

                                     VANESSA
                         Sure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny?

                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny?  Randy, you 
                         know.  To you, am I eros manifest?

                                     VANESSA
                         I hope this is part of the unfreezing 
                         process.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash; 
                         that's what I do, I swing.

                                     VANESSA
                         I understand that, Mr. Powers, but 
                         let me be perfectly clear with you, 
                         perhaps to the point of being 
                         insulting.  I will never have sex 
                         with you, ever.  If you were the 
                         last man on Earth and I was the last 
                         woman on Earth, and the future of 
                         the human race depended on our having 
                         sex simply for procreation, I still 
                         would not have sex with you.

               Austin is oblivious.

               There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think 
               may be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives 
               gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's 
               the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat

                         long time, but I'm back.  It's all 
                         gone perfectly to plan except for 
                         one small flaw.  Because of a 
                         technical error, my right arm was 
                         not frozen.  I was therefore by 
                         definition only partially frozen.

               ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty, 
               eyes darting left and right.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But my design was perfect!  Your 
                         autonomic functions were shut down, 
                         and even though your arm wasn't 
                         frozen, the aging was retarded, 
                         therefore your right arm is only 
                         slightly older than the left.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Can't you see I'm only half a man?  
                         Look at me, I'm a freak!

               He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But Dr. Evil, all you need to do 
                         is&emdash;

                         --work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze 
                         it for twenty minutes a day.  A few 
                         months of that and it'll be just as 
                         strong as the other arm...

                                     DR. EVIL
                         And look what you've done to Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth!

               ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH

               who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair 
               around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         We could not anticipate feline 
                         complications due to the reanimation

                         Silence!

               ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT

               Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he 
               falls backwards into a pit.

                                     MUSTAFA
                              (blood-curdling scream)
                         Ahhhhhhhhh!

                         Let this be a reminder to you all 
                         that this organization will not 
                         tolerate failure.

               MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY

               ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY 
               FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS

               scar on his cheek.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, let's get down to business.

               More muffled SCREAMS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         We've got a lot of work to do.

                              (muffled)
                         Someone help me!  I'm still alive, 
                         only I'm very badly burned.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (slightly distracted)
                         Some of you I know, some of you I'm 
                         meeting for the first time.

                              (muffled)
                         Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone 
                         call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a 
                         lot of pain.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (very frustrated)
                         You've all been gathered here to 
                         form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me.

               He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it.

                              (muffled)
                         If somebody can open the retrieval 
                         hatch down here, I could get out.  
                         See, I designed this device myself 
                         and...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you 
                         found me.  Listen, I'm very badly

                         Ow!  You shot me!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.  Okay.  Moving on.

                         Let me go around the table and

               He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it.  
               It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room.

                         Over the last thirty years, Virtucon 
                         has grown by leaps and bounds.  About 
                         fifteen years ago, we changed from 
                         volatile chemicals to the

                         Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called 
                         blackmail.  The Royal Family of 
                         Britain are the wealthiest landowners 
                         in the world.  Either the Royal Family 
                         pays us an exorbitant amount of money, 
                         or we make it look like Prince 
                         Charles, the heir to the throne, has 
                         had an affair outside of marriage 
                         and, therefore, they would have to 
                         divorce.

               There is an uncomfortable silence.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did 
                         have an affair.  He admitted it, and 
                         they are now divorced, actually.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         People have to tell me these things.  
                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         throw me a bone here.
                              (pausing)
                         OK, no problem.  Here's my second 
                         plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a 
                         weather changing machine that was in 
                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a "laser."  Using 
                         this laser, we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around

               the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly 
               but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the 
               risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a 
               hefty ransom.

               There is another uncomfortable silence.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Umm, that also has already happened.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.
                              (pause)
                         Oh, hell, let's just do what we always 
                         do.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons 
                         and hold the world hostage.
                              (pause)
                         Gentlemen, it's come to my attention 
                         that a breakaway Russian Republic 
                         called Kreplachistan will be 
                         transferring a nuclear warhead to 
                         the United Nations in a few days.  
                         Here's the plan.  We get the warhead, 
                         and we hold the world ransom...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is an uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't you think we should ask for 
                         more than a million dollars?  A 
                         million dollars isn't that much money 
                         these days.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         All right then...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is another uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Virtucon alone makes over nine billion 
                         dollars a year.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pleasantly surprised)
                         Oh, really?
                              (slightly irritated)
                         One-hundred billion dollars.
                              (pause)
                         OK, make it happen.  Anything else?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Remember when we froze your semen, 
                         you said that if it looked like you 
                         weren't coming back to try and make 
                         you a son so that a part of you would 
                         live forever?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Well, after a few years, we got sort 
                         of impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you 
                         to meet your son.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         My son?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Yes.
                              (calling out)
                         Scott!

               SCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a 
               Kurt Cobain T-shirt.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Hi.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr. 
                         Evil.
                              (emotional)
                         I have a son!  I have a son!  
                         Everyone, I have a son!
                              (gesturing to globe)
                         Someday, Scott, this will all be 
                         yours.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I haven't seen you my whole life and 
                         now you show up and want a 
                         relationship?  I hate you!

               EXT.  JAGUAR - DRIVING - VEGAS - DAY

               Vanessa and Austin drive in his perfectly-preserved Jag.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing!

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a 
                         secure cellular phone, an on-board 
                         computer, and a Global Geosynchronous 
                         Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally, 
                         this.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various 
               dental hygiene products&emdash; floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, 
               dental mirror, and cleaning tool.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me guess.  The floss is garotte 
                         wire, the toothpaste contains plastic 
                         explosives, and the toothbrush is 
                         the detonation device.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, actually.  I don't know how to 
                         put this really.  Well, there have 
                         been fabulous advances in the field 
                         of dentistry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why?  What's wrong with my teeth?

               EXT.  VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT

               The Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door.

               INT.  VEGAS HOTEL ROOM

               Vanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin 
               takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite 
               suitcases.

                                     AUSITN
                         Which side of the bed do you want?

                                     VANESSA
                         You're going to sleep on the sofa.  
                         I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, 
                         that the only reason we're sharing a 
                         room is to support our cover story 
                         that we're a married couple on 
                         vacation.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, shall we shag now, or shall we 
                         shag later?  How do you like to do 
                         it?  Do you like to wash up first?  
                         Top and tails?  A whore's bath?  
                         Personally, before I'm on the job, I 
                         like to give my undercarriage a bit 
                         of a how's-your-father.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (off her angry reaction)
                         I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to 
                         get a rise out of you.

               They both laugh.

                                     VANESSA
                         Let's unpack.

               HER LUGGAGE:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents.  
               All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, nerd alert.

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington 
               shaver with huge English plug.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel 
               iron and a Braun blow drier.

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle 
               of Jurgens lotion.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a 
               plastic baggie marked "Underthings" and her shoes in a baggie 
               marked "Shoes."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and 
               Hai Karate cologne.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a dossier labeled "Dr. Evil - 
               Top Secret."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump.  
               Vanessa sees it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's 
                         playing a prank on me!  Honestly, 
                         this isn't mine.

                                     VANESSA
                              (suffering)
                         I'm sure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think I'll give that stew a ding-a-
                         ling.

               Austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm.  
               After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the 
               handset.

                                     MOVIE PHONE VOICE
                              (through handset)
                         Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM!

               Austin covers the mouthpiece and whispers to Vanessa.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got her answering machine.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa walk through the casino.  Austin gives 
               PEOPLE two-handed handshakes.  They stare like he's a freak.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love Las Vegas, man.  Oh, I forgot 
                         my x-ray glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                         Here, use mine.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to use a cover name.  It's 
                         important that it be a generic name 
                         so that we don't draw attention to 
                         ourselves.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table.  Number Two 
               is there, complete with eyepatch.  On one side of him is a 
               beautiful ITALIAN WOMAN (a la SOPHIA LOREN) in a white dress 
               with a white kerchief on her head.  On the other side of him 
               is an extremely large-breasted BIMBO.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do you mind if I join you?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Not at all.

               The DEALER deals.

                                     DEALER
                         Seventeen.

               Zoom in on Number Two's eyepatch.

               NUMBER TWO'S MONOCULAR POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  We see everyone at the casino 
               in their underwear.  He looks at the next card in the shoe.  
               It is a 4.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hit me.

                                     DEALER
                         You have seventeen, sir.  The book 
                         says not to, sir.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I like to live dangerously.

               The dealer draws a card from the card shoe.

                                     DEALER
                         Four.  Twenty-one.

               Everyone at the table applauds.  The dealer deals to Austin 
               and Number Two.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Eighteen.
                              (to Number Two)
                         Sixteen.

               NUMBER TWO'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  He looks at the shoe at the 
               shoe and sees that the next card is a ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I'll stay.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

               Smugly, Austin puts on Vanessa's x-ray glasses.

               AUSTIN'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY SPECS".  Everyone is in their underwear, 
               but it is completely blurry.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

                                     VANESSA
                              (quietly)
                         What's wrong?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (quietly, to Vanessa)
                         I can't see a bloody thing.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're 
                         prescription X-ray glasses.  I have 
                         very bad astigmatism.

                                     DEALER
                         Sir, the table is waiting.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (panicking)
                         Uh, hit me.

               The table MURMURS.

                                     DEALER
                         On an eighteen, sir?

                         Yes, I also like to live dangerously.

               The dealer deals him the ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         You're very brave.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow 
                         myself to introduce...myself.  My 
                         name is Ritchie Cunningham.

               Vanessa is mortified.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (indicating Vanessa)
                         This is my wife, Enid.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My name is Number Two.

               He extends his hand to shake.  Austin extends his hand, but 
               misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.  There is an 
               awkward pause.  Austin takes off his glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                              (rescuing him)
                         Number Two?  That's an unusual name.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My parents were hippies.

                         secretary.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it.  
                         It sounds like you're saying your 
                         name is a lot of...never mind.  
                         Listen, cats, I'm going to crash.  
                         It's been a gas.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Peace, baby.

               Austin and Vanessa leave.

               INT.  CASINO

                                     VANESSA
                         Why did you leave so soon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That cat Number Two has an X-ray 
                         eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him, 
                         man.  Listen, we should go back to 
                         the room, but first I have to go to 
                         the naughty chair and see a man about 
                         a dog.

               He heads to the rest room.

               INT.  HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO

               Number Two has been watching them.  He presses a BUTTON.

               INT.  BATHROOM - CASINO

               Austin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy 
               hat.  Austin enters a stall.  The Texan enters the adjoining 
               stall.

                                     TEXAN
                         Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy 
                         food, you rent it.

                         Too right, youth.

               INT.  BATHROOM STALL

               Austin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing 
               Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks 
               back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it 
               around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the 
               wire and certain death.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (grunting)
                         Uh, uh!

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about 
               frantically.  He can hear the

               GRUNTING.

                                     TEXAN
                         Hey pardner, just relax, don't force 
                         it!  Use some creative visualization.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's 
               crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony.

                                     PATTY O'BRIEN
                              (groaning)
                         Ughhhhh...

               Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty 
               O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it 
               hovers above the toilet bowl.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who does Number Two work for?

                         That's right!  Show that turd who's 
                         boss!

               INT.  AUSITN'S STALL

                         Who does Number Two work for?

                                     PATTY O'BRIEN
                              (quietly, straining)
                         Go to hell.

               Austin drops Patty's head into the toilet and FLUSHES.  We 
               hear MUFFLED GURGLING SOUNDS from Patty O'Brien.

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan hears all of this, and is now concerned.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin reaches into Patty O'Brien's wallet.  We see his Dr. 
               Evil ID card and Alotta's Virtucon business card with her 
               address.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin is leaving his stall.  The Texan can see Patty 
               O'Brien's dead body head-first in the toilet.

                                     TEXAN
                         Jesus Christ, what did you eat?

               ANGLE ON THE FLOOR OF AUSTIN'S STALL

               Patty O'Brien's lifeless hand hits the floor.  The charms 
               come tumbling out: a heart, a moon, a star, and a clover.  A 
               second later, a blue diamond falls out.

               Vanessa is on the phone on the bed sifting through photos 
               and files on Dr. Evil, Virtucon, etc.

               In the background, through an open door, we see that Austin 
               is asleep on the couch.

                                     VANESSA
                              (into phone)
                         Hello Mum?

               INT.  MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE - LONDON

               An older Mrs. Kensington sits in her suburban English front 
               room.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                              (on phone)
                         Oh, hello Vanessa.  How was the 
                         flight?

                                     VANESSA (V.O.)
                         Great.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         How's Austin?

                                     VANESSA (V.O.)
                         He's asleep.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         You didn't...

               INT.  HOTEL SUITE

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the 
                         couch.

               In the background, we see Austin get off the couch.  He is 
               very naked and very hairy.  A strategically placed vase of 
               flowers blocks his naughty bits from view.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I'm proud of you.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         Because you managed to resist Austin 
                         Power's charms.

               Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.  
               Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number 
               Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, God knows he tried, but I've 
                         been rather firm with him, Mummy.  
                         You didn't tell me he was so obsessed 
                         with sex.  It's bizarre.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         You can't judge him by modern 
                         standards.  He's very much a product 
                         of his times.  In my day he could 
                         have any woman he wanted.

                         You have to understand, in Britain 
                         in the Sixties you could be a sex 
                         symbol and still have bad teeth.  It 
                         didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         I just don't see it.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in 
                         his charms, it's impossible to get 
                         out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever...

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Of course not.  I was married to 
                         your father.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever want to?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Austin is very charming, very 
                         debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has 
                         a knowledge of fine wines, 
                         sophisticated, a world-renowned 
                         photographer.  Women want hin, men 
                         want to be him.  He's a lover of 
                         love&emdash; every bit an 
                         International Man of Mystery.

               We hear the TOILET FLUSH.  Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the 
               screen.

               Austin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED.  Vanessa 
               holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and 
               in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera.

                                     VANESSA
                         You didn't answer my question, Mum.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I know.  Let me just say this: Austin 
                         was the most loyal and caring friend 
                         I ever had.

               I will always love him.

                         Do you want to talk to him?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         No, it's been too long.  Best to 
                         leave things alone.

                         Look, I'd better go.  I love you.

                         I love you, Vanessa.

               Vanessa hangs up.  Austin enters wearing an "Austin Powers" 
               robe.

               another BODYGUARD exit the limo and secure the area.

               We see that the binoculars belong to Vanessa.  She and Austin 
               are on a stakeout.  Austin's Jag is in the background.

                                     VANESSA
                         A limousine has just pulled up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me see.

               Austin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens 
               attached to his vintage camera.

               Two more BODYGUARDS leave the building and approach the limo.  
               Number Two exits the building

               holding Mr. Bigglesworth, the hairless cat.  He's not happy 
               about this, and has a scratch on his cheek.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, hello.  That's Dr. Evil's 
                         cat.

                                     VANESSA
                         How do you know?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I never forget a pussy...cat.

                         Let's go get him!

                                     AUSTIN
                         He's too well-protected right now.

                                     VANESSA
                         We can't just sit here, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me tell you a story.  There's 
                         these two bulls on top of a hill 
                         checking out some foxy cows in the 
                         meadow below.  The young bull says, 
                         'hey, why don't we run down the hill 
                         and shag us a cow?', and the wise 
                         old bull replies, 'no, why don't we 
                         walk down the hill and shag all the 
                         cows?'

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't get it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, you know...cows, and shagging.

                                     VANESSA
                         Unfortunately, while you told that 
                         stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No worries, luv.  We'll just give 
                         Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

               He notices the way the desert light catches her beauty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly 
                         beautiful.  Stay right where you 
                         are.

               Austin changes lenses and begins SNAPPING PICTURES.

                                     VANESSA
                         I hate having my picture taken.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're crazy.  The camera loves you, 
                         Vanessa.

               Vanessa does a few coy poses.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Go, Vanessa, go!

               Vanessa lets go a little bit more.

               WHITE CYC

               Austin and Vanessa are in the midst of a full professional 
               photo shoot, and she's loving it.

               Austin begins SNAPPING pictures, all the while changing her 
               look, touching her hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me Vanessa.  Smashing!  Crazy.  
                         Give me some shoulder.
                              (pause)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

               He motions to her two top buttons of her blouse.  She nods 
               no.  Austin nods yes.  She sheepishly undoes them.  A MONTAGE 
               of her in various gowns, one more exotic and exciting than 
               the other.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Show me love.  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         Smashing!

               Vanessa is flanked by two buff MALE MODELS à la Madonna.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great!  Great!  Smashing!
                              (beat)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No!  No!

               Love it.  Give me love.  Give me mouth.  Give me lips.

                                     (BEAT)
                         Going in very close now.

               He goes in closer.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me eyes.
                              (closer)
                         Give me cornea.
                              (closer)
                         Give me aqueous humour.
                              (closer)
                         Coming in closer.  Give me retina, 
                         Vanessa.
                              (closer)
                         Even closer.  Give me optic nerve.
                              (beat)
                         Love it!
                              (beat)
                         And...done.

               He throws the camera down.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm spent.  What say you we go out 
                         on the town?

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT

               Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double-
               decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner.  
               They're drinking champagne.

               Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding 
               his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point 
               to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it 
               to her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fancy a nibble?

                                     VANESSA
                         I couldn't have another bite.

               They laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them.

               They begin to dance.

               Austin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT

               They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying 
               each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She 
               graciously accepts.

               64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE

               Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of 
               backgrounds&emdash; neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, 
               etc.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM

               Sounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking 
               out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled 
               leg straining upwards.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Watch out, you're on my hair!

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Sorry.  Move your hand to the left.  
                         There you go.  Gorgeous.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Go!  Just go!

               We hear a SPINNING SOUND.

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Left hand, blue.

               We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She 
               reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait a tick, I forgot something in 
                         the lobby.
                              (moving behind the 
                              couch)
                         I know what.  I'll take the stairs.

               Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe I'll take the escalator.

               Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why take the escalator when I could 
                         take a canoe?

               Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch.

                                     VANESSA
                         I haven't had fun like that since 
                         college.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry that bug up your ass had 
                         to die.

               She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound.

                                     VANESSA
                         Always wanting to have fun, that's 
                         you in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, this is me in a nutshell.

               Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind 
                         of nut has such a big nutshell?  How 
                         did I get into this bloody great big 
                         nutshell?

               Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're smashed, Vanessa.

                                     VANESSA
                         I am not.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes you are.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm 
                         always the designated driver.

               They are both on the bed.  She looks at him.  He looks at 
               her.  There is an awkward silence.

               She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't.  You're drunk.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just 
                         beginning to see what my Mum was 
                         talking about.
                              (pause)
                         What was my mother like back in the 
                         Sixties?  I'm dying to know.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (sentimental)
                         She was very groovy.  She was so in 
                         love with your Dad.  If there was 
                         one

               other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and 
               treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me.  But, 
               unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.

               Austin hears SNORING.  He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep.  
               A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a

               RED LIGHT FLASHES.

               Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE 
               PHONE.  It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on the picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin, this is Basil 
                         Exposition from British Intelligence.  
                         Thank you for confirming the link 
                         between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find 
                         out what part Virtucon plays in 
                         something called Project Vulcan.  
                         I'll need you and Vanessa to get on 
                         that immediately.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Right away, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Where is Vanessa, by the way?

               Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure.

                                     AUSTIN

               INT.  ALOTTA'S JAPANESE STYLE PENTHOUSE

               Austin is in a dark penthouse suite.  Austin passes a piece 
               of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy.

               He goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase.  He 
               opens it.

               FULL SCREEN - DOCUMENT

               Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature 
               camera/pendant.

                         Give it to me baby.  Super.

               We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's 
               holdings in a flow-chart fashion.

                         Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!

               One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects."  Under 
               that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie", 
               and in CLOSE-UP&emdash; "Project Vulcan."

               We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a 
               cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core."

                         Cunningham.  We can talk about

               Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she 
               takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair 
               of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto.

               She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on 
               her shoulder, and enters the water.

                         I'd rather talk about Number Two.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?  
                         Come in, and I'll show you everything 
                         you need to know.

               Austin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He 
               goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over.

                                     ALOTTA
                         May I wash you?

                         Groovy.

               She washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his 
               wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION.  
               It reads "AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY."

               ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC.  
               SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS

               trousers.

                         come second.

                         Sak-i it to me!

               Alotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her 
               ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation 
               Pills."  She drops two PILLS into his drink.

               Austin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly 
               woozy.

                                     ALOTTA

                         Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation.

               A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin.

               garb around a large UN-style meeting table.  The BRITISH are 
               dressed in bowler hats.  The AMERICANS all look like JFK.  
               The CANADIANS are dressed as Mounties.  The ARABS are dressed 
               in ceremonial robes, etc.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

               They all look up at the SCREEN.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         In a little while, you'll find out 
                         that the Kreplachistani warhead has 
                         gone missing.  Well, it's in safe 
                         hands.  If you want it back, you'll 
                         have to pay me...ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

               The UN representatives are confused.  Number Two COUGHS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (frustrated)
                         Sorry.  ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!

               The representatives ARGUE amongst themselves.

                                     UNITED NATIONS SECRETATY
                         Gentlemen, silence!
                              (to Dr. Evil)

               NOW, MR. EVIL&EMDASH;

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (angry)
                         Doctor Evil!  I didn't spend six 
                         years in evil medical school to be 
                         called 'mister'.

                                     UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY
                         Excuse me.  Dr. Evil, it is the policy 
                         of the United Nations not to negotiate 
                         with terrorists.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen, 
                         you have five days to come up with 
                         one

               hundred billion dollars.  If you fail to do so, we'll set 
               off the warhead and destroy the world.

                                     UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY
                         You can't destroy the world with a 
                         single warhead.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?  So long.

               The screen goes BLANK.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (to evil associates)
                         Gentlemen, in exactly five days from 
                         now, we will be one-hundred billion 
                         dollars richer.
                              (laughing)
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha.
                              (slightly louder)
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha.

                                     EVIL ASSOCIATES
                              (laughing with him)
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha.

               DR. EVIL & ASSOCIATES

               (LOUDER AND MORE STACCATO)

               HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!

               (louder again, and even more evil and maniacal)

               HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Ohhhh, ahhhhhh...
                              (pause, quieter)
                         Ohhh, hmmmm.
                              (pause, very quiet)
                         hmn.

               There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should 
               have FADED TO BLACK.  The evil associates look around the 
               room, not knowing what to do with themselves.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Okay...Well...I think I'm going to 
                         watch some TV.

                                     EVIL ASSOCIATES
                         Okay.  Sure.

               They exit the frame awkwardly.

               INT.  BRITISH MAKESHIFT HQ

               Austin and Vanessa enter past two BRITISH MILITARY POLICEMAN.  
               There is a communications center, a makeshift armory, bunks, 
               etc.

               We see Basil, dressed as the Vegas-era Elvis.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up 
                         to speed.  Dr. Evil has high-jacked 
                         a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan 
                         and is holding the world ransom for 
                         one-hundred billion dollars.  If the 
                         world doesn't pay up in four days, 
                         he's threatening to destroy the world.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you, Exposition.  Only two 
                         things, scare me, and one is nuclear 
                         war.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's the other?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Excuse me?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's the other thing you're scared 
                         of?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Carnies.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Circus folk.
                              (shudders)
                         Nomads, you know.  They smell like 
                         cabbage.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (suffering him)
                         Indeed...If we could get back to the 
                         business at hand.  It's one thing to 
                         have a warhead, it's quite another 
                         thing to have the missiles to launch 
                         it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe these photographs are the last 
                         piece of that puzzle.
                              (hands him the photos)
                         I've uncovered the details on Project 
                         Vulcan.  It's a new subterranean 
                         warhead delivery system.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Good God, and underground missile.  
                         We've long feared such a development.

                                     VANESSA
                         When did you find that out, Austin?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin did some reconnaissance work 
                         at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last 
                         night.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITON
                         Our next move is to infiltrate 
                         Virtucon.  Any ideas?

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their 
                         facilities every hour.  I suggest we 
                         pose as tourists and do site-level 
                         reconnaissance.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Top drawer, Kensington.  Oh, Austin, 
                         I want you to meet somebody.

               Basil waves to an extremely frail ELDERLY BRITISH LADY.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. 
                         Exposition.  She's in from Tunbridge 
                         Wells

               in Kent.  Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old?

               Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         My God, Austin, what have you done?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not your mother, that's a 
                         man!

               Austin begins tugging on her hair.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                         Owww...my hair!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Get away from my mother!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, have you gone mad?

               The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                              (through pain)
                         Who is that man?  Why did he hit me?

                                     BASIL EXPOSIION
                         Don't worry, mother.  Lie down.  
                         Austin, you have a lot of explaining 
                         to do.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was 
                         a man.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Damn it, man!  You're talking about 
                         my mother!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You must admit, she is rather mannish.  
                         No offense, but if that's a woman, 
                         it looks like she's been beaten with 
                         an ugly stick.

                                     VANESSA
                         Really, Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Look at her hands, baby!  Those are 
                         carpenter's hands.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         All right, Austin, I think you should 
                         go.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think if everyone were honest, 
                         they'd confess that the lady looks 
                         exactly like a man in drag.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm leaving!
                              (pause)
                         Oh, and Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, Basil?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Be careful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks.

               Basil escorts his mother out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, may I have a word with you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Listen, I know I'm just being 
                         neurotic, but I can't shake this 
                         suspicious

               feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I 
               don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad 
               relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues.  
               You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to 
               give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this 
               weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't be sorry.  You're right to be 
                         suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged 
                         her rotten.

                                     VANESSA
                              (stunned)
                         I can't believe you made love to her 
                         just like that.  Did you use 
                         protection?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, I had my nine-millimeter 
                         automatic.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, did you use a condom?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Only sailors use condoms, man.

                                     VANESSA
                         Not in the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well they should, filthy beggars, 
                         they go from port to port.  Alotta 
                         meant nothing to me.

                                     VANESSA
                              (pause)
                         Well, it means something to me.  If 
                         you want us to have a relationship, 
                         you've got to be a one-woman man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're 
                         everything to me.

                                     VANESSA
                         You just don't get it, do you, Austin?  
                         Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties, 
                         you're going to be very lonely.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin 
               looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a 
               list of names crossed out, with

               comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see 
               "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama 
               Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, 
               Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

               Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.  
               He picks up his new pair&emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER 
               PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

               Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We 
               see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S 
               and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

               Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened 
               Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It 
               explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

               He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The 
               NOISE is awful.

               Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head 
               ripped off, and blood spews out.

               Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too 
               loose and water shoots all around the bathroom.

               EXT.  CAR - STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

               Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of 
               Las Vegas.

               INT.  CASINO BAR - NIGHT

               Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY 
               YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a 
               freak.

               Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down 
               with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin 
               is pleased.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Austin sits watching the TIME-LIFE The Last Thirty Years 
               video on TV.  Vanessa enters.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thirty years of political and social 
                         upheaval.  The fall of the Berlin 
                         wall, a female Prime Minister of 
                         England, the abolishment of Apartheid, 
                         a fascinating tapestry of human strum 
                         und drang.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was 
                         gay.  Women loved him, man.  I didn't 
                         see that one coming.

                                     VANESSA
                         Basil was very concerned to know 
                         where you were last night.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Out and about, doing odds and sods.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'll tell him.  By the way, I've 
                         decided we should keep our 
                         relationship strictly professional.

               INT.  THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

               We're in the middle of a group therapy session, containing 
               six or seven FATHERS with their teenage SONS.  It is 
               emotionally charged.  A lot of pained expressions and coffee 
               in Styrofoam cups.

                                     SON 1
                              (crying)
                         I love you, Dad.

                                     DAD 1
                         I love you, Son.

               They hug.  Everyone APPLAUDS.  We see Dr. Evil and Scott.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave.  
                         Thank you.  OK, group, we have two 
                         new member.  Say hello to Scott and 
                         his father, Mr....Ehville?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

                                     GROUP
                         Hello, Dr. Evil.  Hello, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (into it)
                         Hello, everybody.

                                     THERAPIST
                         So, Scott, why don't we start with 
                         you.  Why are you here?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, it's kind of weird.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't judge here.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         OK.  Well, I just really met my Dad 
                         for the first time three days ago.  
                         He was partially frozen for thirty 
                         years.  I never knew him growing up.  
                         He comes back and now he wants me to 
                         take over the family business.

                                     THERAPIST
                         And how do you feel about that?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't wanna take over the family 
                         business.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         But Scott, who's going to take over 
                         the world when I die?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Not me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         What do you want to do, Scott?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't know.  I was thinking, maybe 
                         I'd be a vet or something, cause I 
                         like animals and stuff.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil vet?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No.  Maybe, like, work in a petting 
                         zoo or something.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil petting zoo?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (shouting)
                         You always do that!
                              (calm)
                         Anyways, this is really hard, because, 
                         you know, my Dad is really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't label people here, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No, he's really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Scott.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, the boy's right.  I really am 
                         evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Don't be so hard on yourself.  You're 
                         here, that's what's important.  A 
                         journey of a thousand miles begins 
                         with one step.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I just think, like, he hates me.  I 
                         really think he wants to kill me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         OK, Scott, no one really wants to 
                         "kill" anyone here.  They say it, 
                         but they don't mean it.

               The group LAUGHS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, the boy's quite astute.  I 
                         am trying to kill him.  My Evil 
                         Associates have cautioned against 
                         it, so here he is, unfortunately, 
                         alive.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We've heard from Scott, now let's 
                         hear from you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         The details of my life are quite 
                         inconsequential.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That's not true, Doctor.  Please, 
                         tell us about your childhood.

                                     GROUP
                         Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Very well, where should I begin?  My 
                         father was a relentlessly self-
                         improving boulangerie owner from 
                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy 
                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother 
                         was a fifteen-year-old French 
                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed 
                         feet.  My father would womanize, he 
                         would drink, he would make outrageous 
                         claims, like he invented the question 
                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse 
                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of 
                         general malaise that only the genius 
                         possess and the insane lament.  My 
                         childhood was typical.

               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make 
               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap 
               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the 
               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically 
               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn 
               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical 
               school.  From there...

               ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned.

               A TOUR is in progress.  Austin, Vanessa, and other TOURISTS 
               ride on an electric tram.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a 
                         rancid taste in my mouth.  Do you 
                         have a piece of gum?

                                     VANESSA
                              (in her own world)
                         Do you think she's prettier than I?

                         Who?

                         You know who.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No!  Don't lay your hang-ups on me, 
                         Vanessa.  You're being very trippy.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm looking at you, and the whole 
                         time I can't help thinking you had

                         Well put.  Listen love, we can't 
                         keep having this fight.  I'm an 
                         International Man of Mystery.  
                         Sometimes in the course of my work 
                         to save the world I have to shag 
                         some crumpet.  It's all part of the 
                         job.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Welcome to Virtucon, the company of 
                         the future.
                              (pointing to large 
                              display window)
                         Virtucon is a leading manufacturer 
                         of many items you'll find right in 
                         your own home.  We make steel, 
                         volatile chemicals, petroleum-based 
                         products, and we also own the Franklin 
                         mint, which makes decorative hand-
                         painted theme plates for collectors.
                              (holds up plate)
                         Some plates, like the Gone With The 
                         Wind series, have gone up in value 
                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

               The people on the tour APPLAUD.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Coming up on the left, we have the 
                         Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide 
                         range of Virtucon licensed products.  
                         On the right, you'll notice a door 
                         that leads to a restricted area.  
                         Only authorized personnel are allowed 
                         beyond that point.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA

               All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a 
               SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with 
               a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear 
               Virtucon coveralls.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll take him, you take her.

               The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; 
               the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin 
               and Vanessa follow.

               We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING 
               KNOCKED OUT.

               Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls 
               over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.   
               They go through the doors into the restricted area.

               INT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

               They approach the security GUARD.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, we don't look anything like 
                         our photo badges.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a 
                         mind control technique during my 
                         travels to India.  I learned it from 
                         my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a 
                         chaste man who mysteriously died of 
                         a disease that had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis.

               Just watch me.  Watch me, now.

               They reach the guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Hi, folks.  You're entering a 
                         restricted zone.  Can I see your 
                         security badges?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               They flash their security badges to the guard.

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, 
               RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE

               other, back and forth.

               MUSIC:  Mystical Indian sitar.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hypnotist-like)
                         Everything seems to be in order.

                                     GUARD
                              (looking at the badges)
                         Hey, wait a minute&emdash;

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  He redoubles his eye-brow-raising.

                                     GUARD
                              (trance-like, in 
                              Austin's English 
                              accent)
                         Everything seems to be in order.

                                     VANESSA
                         That's amazing.  Let's go!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on one second.

               Austin again does his mind control trick.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

                                     GUARD
                              (in trace)
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

               He hands Austin a piece of gum.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't mind if I do.

                                     GUARD
                              (slipping out of trance)
                         Hey!  Wait a minute, that's my last 
                         piece of gum.

               Austin does his mind-control again.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     GUARD
                              (trance-like)
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (mind-controlling)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

                                     VANESSA
                              (irritated)
                         Austin, we have to go!

               She pulls him away.

                                     GUARD (O.S.)
                              (faintly)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

               Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked "PROJECT VULCAN - 
               TOP SECRET."  They walk through.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               Inside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits 
               surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         This is the strongest, sharpest drill 
                         bit ever produced by man.  It weighs 
                         fifteen metric tones and can bore 
                         through a mile-thick bedrock of solid 
                         granite in seven seconds.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM

               A SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count.  They 
               notice Austin and Vanessa's empty seats on the tram.  The 
               guard speaks into his walkie-talkie.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               SFX:  ALARM GOES OFF

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (on PA)
                         Attention, there are intruders in 
                         the complex.

               All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin 
               and Vanessa.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         Get them!

               The scientist approach.  Austin knocks two of them out cold 
               with judo chops.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks.  
               SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.  Austin 
               and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads 
               "VIRTUCON

               STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY."

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a 
               large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test 
               track very slowly.

               Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving 
               steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin 
               fanning out in a search.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Our only way out of here is to drive 
                         out!

               They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER, 
               push him off, and assume the controls.

                                     P.A. (O.S.)
                         There they are!

               Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.  
               Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.  
               Austin punches the other one off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hang on!  I'm going to floor it!

               He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster.

               TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They 
               are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a 
               fast-approaching car.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where did you learn to shoot?

                                     VANESSA
                         Where did you learn to drive?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY 
               AS IF "IN THE NICK OF TIME."  THE

               steamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still 
               frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, watch out!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Where?  Where?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE 
               STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS

               away.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING 
               THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO

               downshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along 
               with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks.

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE 
               STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF

               blood and guts.

               By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run 
               out into the hallway.

               INT.  HALLWAY

               The coast is clear.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thank God, Austin, we made it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, act naturally and we'll split 
                         this scene the way we came in, 
                         Vanessa.

               From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is 
               Random Task flanked by four SECURITY

               GUARDS.

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               We see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood 
               and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns 
               to reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on 
               his jumpsuit.

               Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and 
               dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled 
               Army guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN."

               EXT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES

               It is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house.  We 
               hear a PHONE RINGING.

               INT.  KITCHEN

               A pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone.

                                     MIDDLE AGED LADY
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, that's right, he's a henchman 
                         in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
                              (pause)
                         What?  Killed?
                              (pause)
                         How?
                              (pause)
                         Run over by a steamroller?  Oh my 
                         God.  Thank you for calling.

               She HANGS UP.  A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters.

                                     FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
                         Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home?  
                         He said he was going to teach me to 
                         play ball.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Sit down, Billy, I have some bad 
                         news.  As you know, your brother 
                         Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's 
                         Private Army.

                                     BILLY
                         Was?  What is it, Mom?

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Your brother was run over by a 
                         steamroller.

                                     BILLY
                         A steamroller?
                              (bursting into tears)
                         No, not Steve!  Since Dad died, 
                         Steve's been like a father to me.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         I'm sorry son.  People never think 
                         how things affect the family of the 
                         henchman.
                              (hugging him)
                         I love you, Billy.
                              (to herself, out loud)
                         I wonder if we'll be able to receive 
                         Steve's henchman's comp.

               We see a Virtucon electric minivan humning along.

               INT.  BACK OF ELECTRIC MINIVAN

               Austin and Vanessa are unconscious.

               EXT.  HIGHWAY

               The electric minivan turns onto a dirt road that leads to a 
               boulder.

               EXT.  DESERT - BOULDER

               The boulder lifts up and the minivan drives into it.

               The minivan enters a long cylindrical tunnel.

               The minivan is being lowered on a high-speed elevator.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER

               VIRTUCON ARMY MEMBERS keep watch.  SCIENTISTS check

                         Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.

               The electric minivan pulls up right next to the immense table.  
               All the evil associates are present.  Dr. Evil squeezes a 
               tennis ball repeatedly.  Frau Farbissina opens the rear hatch 
               of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. 
                         Powers.  Mrs. Kensington's daughter, 
                         how lovely.  I believe your name is 
                         Vanessa?  I'd shake your hands, except 
                         for obvious reasons.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't understand.

                         My hand, dammit!  Look at it!

                                     AUSTIN
                         What's wrong with your hand?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't try to suck up to me!  It's a 
                         little late for that.  I'm a freak!

               Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

               He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually 
               normal, just slightly aged.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking 
                         your head space.

                         Oh forget it.  As a fellow player on 
                         the international stage, Mr. Powers, 
                         I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the 
                         curtain fall on the third and final 
                         act.

                         Gentlemen, I give you the Vulcan.

               He presses a button on his chair panel.  A giant canvas falls, 
               unveiling an ultra-high tech diamond-bladed subterranean 
               bore&emdash; the VULCAN.  It is rather phallic.

                         Does that make you horny?

                              (voice over)
                         So powerful it can penetrate the 
                         Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton 
                         nuclear warhead into the planet's 
                         hot liquid core.  Upon detonation, 
                         every volcano on the planet will 
                         erupt.

                         He's only got one warhead and he's 
                         going to detonate it deep underground.

                         My God, man, don't you understand?  
                         It won't just be active volcanoes, 
                         inactive ones will erupt as well.

                         Tectonic plates will shift, causing 
                         massive earthquakes.  Imagine no

                         clotted cream, the diving mystery of 
                         Stonehenge.  Imagine severing forever 
                         the continuity of Britannic majesty, 
                         the demise of this sceptered isle,

                         I think you'll enjoy the food.  I 
                         have the best chef in the world.  
                         His name is Ezekial.  He's made of

                         Scott my boy, come here.  How was 
                         your day?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, me and a buddy went to the 
                         video arcade in town and, like, they 
                         don't speak English right, and so my 
                         buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 
                         'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't 
                         speak French or whatever', and the 
                         other guy goes something in Paris 
                         talk, and I go 'um, just back off' 
                         and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make 
                         me'.

                         Fascinating.  What are your plans 
                         for this evening?

                         Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good 
                         tittie movie on Skinemax.

                         And that's how you want to live your 
                         life, is it?

                         Yeah.  What?

               DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE

               button labeled "SCOTT."  Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away.

                         Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's 
                         nemesis, Austin Powers.

                         Why are you feeding him?  Why don't 
                         you just kill him?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         In due time.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         But what if he escapes?  Why don't 
                         you just shoot him?  What are you 
                         waiting for?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have a better idea.  I'm going to 
                         put him in an easily-escapable 
                         situation involving an overly-
                         elaborate and exotic death.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Why don't you just shoot him now?  
                         Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just 
                         shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         One more peep out of you and you're 
                         grounded.  Let's begin.

               A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil 
               hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of 
                         mine are joining us for dinner.

               They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal.

               The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts 
               them in the dipping mechanism.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil, do you really expect them 
                         to pay?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to 
                         die.  Even after they pay me the 
                         money, I'm still going to melt all 
                         the cities of the world with hot 
                         magma.
                              (to guard)
                         All right, guard, begin the 
                         unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping 
                         Mechanism.

               The guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly 
               towards the surface of the water.

                         Release the sharks!
                              (to the room)
                         All the sharks have had laser beams 
                         attached to their heads.  I figure 
                         every creature deserves a warm meal.

                              nervously)
                         Dr. Evil?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting 
                         my moment of triumph.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         It's about the sharks.  Since you 
                         were frozen, they've been placed on 
                         the Endangered Species List.  We 
                         tried to get some, but it will take 
                         months to clear up the red tape.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (disappointed)
                         Right.
                              (to Austin)
                         Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you 
                         in a tank of piranhas with laser 
                         beams attached to their heads.

               Frau clears her throat again.

                         What is it now?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Well, we experimented with lasers, 
                         but you would be surprised at how 
                         heavy they are.  They actually 
                         outweighed the piranha themselves, 
                         and the fish, well, they sank to the 
                         bottom and died.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have one simple request&emdash; 
                         sharks with friggin' laser beams 
                         attached to their heads, and it can't 
                         be done?  Remind me again why I pay 
                         you people?

               What do we have?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         They're mutated sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?  Are they ill-tempered?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Please allow me to demonstrate.

               Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope 
               towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch 
               through the air.  The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls 
               the rope back.  The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill-
                         tempered sea bass it is.
                              (to the room)
                         Come, let's return to dinner.  Close 
                         the tank.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Aren't you going to watch them?  
                         They'll get away!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, we'll leave them alone and not 
                         actually witness them dying, and 
                         we'll just assume it all went to 
                         plan.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I have a gun in my room.  Give me 
                         five seconds, I'll come back and 
                         blow their brains out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No Scott.  You just don't get it, do 
                         you?

               Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the 
               tank.

               INT.  TANK AREA

               Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They 
               can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.

                                     VANESSA
                         What's your plan?

               Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing 
               Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         First, I plan to soil myself.  Then, 
                         I plan to regroup and think about 
                         the next move.  Any thoughts?

                                     VANESSA
                         Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep 
                         this on me just in case.

               She pulls out a container of dental floss.

                                     AUSTIN
                         All right, I get it.  I have bad 
                         teeth.  You have to understand, in 
                         Britain in the Sixties you could be 
                         a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.  
                         It didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, no, no.  We'll use the floss to 
                         get to the ledge.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing idea!  Give it to me.

               Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.  
               He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches 
               like a grappling hook.

               Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  
               Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the 
               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, 
               the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his 
               hand like a surgeon&emdash;

               Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile 
               the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the 
               open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES 
               at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!

               Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of 
               toothpaste into the guard's eyes.

                                     GUARD
                              (screaming, rubbing 
                              his eyes)
                         My eyes!  My eyes!

               Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing 
               both ends.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on, Vanessa!

               She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety 
               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.  
               Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face.

               He and Austin STRUGGLE.

               The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's 
               head dangling over the water.  SEA

               BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's 
               head.

                                     VANESSA
                              (shouting)
                         Austin, watch out!

               Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's 
               head off like a blender.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Not a good time to lose one's head.

                                     VANESSA
                         Indeed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not the way to get ahead in 
                         life.

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's a shame he wasn't more 
                         headstrong.

                                     VANESSA
                         Shut up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fair enough.

               They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The 
               name tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

               It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad 
               BUSTY WAITRESSES.

               INT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT

               At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, 
               scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer.

                                     GUY 1
                         I can't believe John Smith is getting 
                         married tomorrow.

                                     GUY 2
                         Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not 
                         like him to be late for anything, 
                         especially his own stag party.

                                     GUY 3
                         Well, you know he's a henchman for 
                         Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late.  
                         Can I just say something that may 
                         sound a little sappy?  I think it's 
                         a testament to our friend John that 
                         so many of his buddies showed up in 
                         his honor.  There's a lot of love in 
                         this room.

               A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Hi, I have a phone call here for the 
                         John Smith party.

                                     GUY 1
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
                              (pause)
                         That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's 
                         private army.
                              (pause)
                         What?  He's dead?
                              (pause)
                         Decapitated by mutated flying sea 
                         bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you.

               He hangs up.

                         Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that 
                         John?  Is he coming late?

                                     GUY 1
                         Guys, John's not coming.

                         Why?

                                     GUY 1
                         He was decapitated by mutated flying 
                         sea bass.

                         All right, to Smittie!

               Everyone raises their glasses.

               LEGS drop and wrap around Austin's neck and lift him up.  
               His feet leave the floor.

               Another FEMBOT cartwheels up to Austin.  Nozzles pop out of

               perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth.  Austin smokes the

               Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are 
               aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, 
               and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.

               bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain.

               He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.  
               He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, 
               whose head explodes.

               Bigglesworth running out a read door.

                                     DR. EVIL (O.S.)
                         Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

               Austin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE 
               FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned 
               computers labeled "DESTRUCTACON 5000".

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the 
                         Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed 
                         to prevent you from progressing beyond 
                         this point.  You might as well 
                         surrender.  Resistance is futile.  
                         Your odds of survival are 23,763,273

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, Destructacon 5000, you have 
                         quite a head on your shoulders, I 
                         dare to coin.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Yes, I am programmed to answer any 
                         question.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really?  Let me ask you this.  What 
                         is love?

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         That does not compute.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why not?  It's a question.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Love is...love is...love is...

               The computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

               There is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin 
               passes through the force field and heads for the door until 
               he hears&emdash;

                                     EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
                              (on PA)

               He begins looking furiously for the abort button.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to Eastern European 
                              Man)
                         Where's the abort button?

               The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say 
               'give me one second.'

                                     EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN

                              (to Austin)
                         It's right over there.

               Austin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just 
               then, Random Task enters.  Austin sees him and goes to shoot 
               him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off 
               his SHOE.

               Austin makes his way across the room to the button.

               Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.

               ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR

               The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe 
               has not killed him.  It has just hurt him slightly.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to 
                         have a lump there, you idiot!  Who 
                         throws a shoe?  You fight like a 
                         woman.

                                     EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN
                              (on PA)
                         Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting.

               Random task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands 
               there, menacing, missing one shoe.

               Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin 
               is a Big Gulp.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for a drink?

               Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in 
               front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels 
               through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING 
               him.

               He begins to SMOKE, and then dies.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shocking.

               Austin dives in SLOW MOTION towards the abort button.  He 
               flies through the air for an inordinate length of time.

                                     AUSTIN

                         Nooooooo!

               His hand lands on the button.

               Having saved the world, Austin picks up a MACHIEN GUN from a 
               fallen Private Army guy and runs to the door at the back, 
               chasing Dr. Evil.

               Austin bursts in, catching Dr. Evil packing a suitcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got you, Dr. Evil!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well done, Mr. Powers.  We're not so 
                         different, you and I.  It's true, 
                         you're British, and I'm Belgian.  
                         You have a full head of hair, mine 
                         is slightly receding.  You're thin, 
                         I'm about forty pounds overweight.  
                         OK, we are different, I'm not making 
                         a very good point.  However, isn't 
                         it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very 
                         things you stand for&emdash; swinging, 
                         free love, parties, distrust of 
                         authority- are all now, in the 
                         Nineties, considered to

               be...evil?  Maybe we have more in common than you care to 
               admit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, man, what we swingers were 
                         rebelling against were uptight squares 
                         like you, whose bag was money and 
                         world domination.  We were innocent, 
                         man.  If we'd known the consequences 
                         of our sexual liberation, we would 
                         have done things differently, but 
                         the spirit would have remained the 
                         same.  It's freedom, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Your freedom has cause more pain and 
                         suffering in the world than any plan 
                         I ever dreamed of.  Face it, freedom 
                         failed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's why right now is a very groovy 
                         time, man.  We still have freedom, 
                         but we also have responsibility.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really, there's nothing more pathetic 
                         than an aging hipster.

               Alotta enters.  She holds a gun to Vanessa's head.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Not so fast.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well, it seems the tables have turned, 
                         Mr. Powers.

               Just then, Scott Evil enters.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?

               Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It seems the tables have turned again, 
                         Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Not really.  Kill the little bastard.  
                         See what I care.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Man, you are one chilly square!

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Dad, we just made a breakthrough in 
                         group!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I had the group liquidated, you little 
                         shit.  They were insolent.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I 
                         was never artificially created in a 
                         lab.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, don't say that...

               Scott runs off.  In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun 
               out of Alotta's hands.  Alotta pulls out a knife.  Austin 
               SHOOTS the knife out of her hand.  Vanessa grabs Alotta by 
               the throat.

                                     VANESSA
                         This is for sleeping with my man, 
                         you whore!

                                     ALOTTA
                         I didn't sleep with him.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't believe you.

                                     ALOTTA
                              (choking)
                         It's the teeth.

                                     VANESSA
                         OK, I believe you.  But you still 
                         must be chopped.

               Vanessa gives her a judo chop.

                                     VANESSA
                         Judo chop!

               Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which 
               closes and begins to lift up through

               A HOLE IN THE CEILING.  HE RUNS IN.  ON THE WAY, HE FLIPS A

               Austin and Vanessa draw towards each other, preparing for a 
               passionate kiss.  Just as their lips are about to touch, 
               however, they are interrupted by a strong WIND and the noise 
               of a HELICOPTER OVERHEAD.  Their hair is blown all about and 
               the waves are whipped into a frenzy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Just when things were getting 
                         interesting.

                         Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. 
                         Evil from destroying the world with 
                         his subterranean nuclear probe, and 
                         somehow you and Agent Kensington 
                         managed to escape unscathed from his 
                         evil lair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'd say that about sums it up, 
                         Exposition.

                         Not quite, actually.  Vanessa, I 
                         have something for you.

               Basil hands Vanessa an official-looking set of leather-bound 
               credentials.

                         Because of your exemplary service to

                                     AUSTIN

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks, Basil.  Maybe the Nineties 
                         aren't so bad after all.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, Austin.

               Austin and Vanessa embrace and kiss.

                         Austin motions with his thumbs to 
                         the pilot of the helicopter to lift 
                         Basil up.  He rises away in mid-
                         sentence.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS (STOCK FOTTAGE) - NIGHT

               GRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA

               It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

               The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized 
               conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, 
               including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket 
               and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

               ANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED 
               HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY

               CAT.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face always unseen)
                         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  
                         As you know, my plot to high-jack 
                         nuclear weapons and hold the world 
                         hostage has failed.  Again.  This 
                         organization will not tolerate 
                         failure.

               He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic 
               doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip

               back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and 
               smoking.

                         only man who can stop me now.  We 
                         must go to London.  I've set a trap 
                         for Austin Powers!

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

               We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet 
               pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night 
               Fever.

               We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of 
               Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

               medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National 
               Health Services glasses.

               Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is 
               that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

               Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to 
               a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

               Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO 
               BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all 
               start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

               In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently 
               to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

               One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a 
               metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears 
               a see-through Mary Quant dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (taking photos)
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me baby.  Smashing!

               We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in 
               the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder.  
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No.  No.

               Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm 
               spent.

               Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT 
               scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get these off to Fab Magazine right 
                         away.

                         Austin, you've really outdone yourself 
                         this time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks, baby.

                              (suggestively)
                         We could have another photo session 
                         back at my flat.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (coyly)
                         Oh, behave!

                                     SUPERMODEL 3
                         Austin, I love you!

                                     AUSTIN
                         So many women, so little time.

               A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site.  They 
               recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

                                     MOD GIRL 1
                         It's Austin Powers!

               Austin runs away.  The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's 
               Night.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Two BAD GUYS attack Austin.  He JUDO CHOPS them.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               The mob of girls catches up to Austin and he runs away.

               EXT.  PHONE BOOTH

               Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned.  The mob 
               runs by.  He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

               EXT.  GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY

               Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
               face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention 
               just outside his guard box.

               Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up, 
               but to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER 
               from behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They 
               both crack up.

               EXT.  PHOTO BOOTH

               The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody 
               inside.  Austin steps out.

               ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP

               Panels 1-3 show Austin with various exotic MODELS.  The fourth 
               panel shows Austin with the QUEEN.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that 
               says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You might want to protest a bit louder 
                         next time, luv.

               The both laugh.

               2L  FULL SCREEN INSERT - AUSTIN'S PASSPORT

               The passport opens.  We see Austin's dour photo.  Then he 
               gives an insane grin, showing his bad teeth.  The page flips 
               and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.  The blind man, 
               obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin.  Austin 
               wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to 
               knee him the balls.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF 
               SCHOOLGIRLS.

               After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a 
               baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

               The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to 
               run.

               A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a 
               large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

               He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing 
               off just ahead of the crowd.

               EXT./INT.  JAGUAR - STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

               The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, 
               a beautiful woman in her thirties.

               They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING 
                         RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a 
                         distinctive PHONE RING.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief 
                         of British Intelligence.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone.  
               ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a 
               distinguished older man.  A desk plate reads:  "Basil 
               Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence."

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin.  This is Basil 
                         Exposition, Chief of British 
                         Intelligence.

               You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're 
               with Agent

               Mrs. Kensington.  The year is 1967, and you're talking on a 
               picture phone.

                         We know all that, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I just wanted to be extremely clear 
                         so that everyone knows what's going 
                         on at any given time.  We've just 
                         received word that Dr. Evil, the 
                         ultimate square, is planning to take 
                         over the world.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil?  I thought I put him in 
                         jail for good.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm afraid not.  Earlier this week, 
                         Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel 
                         Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's 
                         planning a trap for you tonight at 
                         the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat 
                         Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus 
                         here in swinging London.

               A panel revolves to reveal a map of London with lights showing 
               Austin's position and the location of the club.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Just where you'd never think to look 
                         for him.  We'll be there.

                         Good luck, Austin.

               The Jaguar pulls up in front of the swinging nightclub.  
               Mrs. Kensington steps out of the car, dressed in a tight 
               leather fightsuit.  She looks fabulous.

               INT.  ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB

               It's a swinging club.  FREAKS abound.  In one corner, there 
               is a PRESS CONFERENCE in progress.

               In one corner ANDY WARHOL sits in front of his multi-colored 
               Elvis (or equivalent).  He body paints a butterfly on the 
               thigh of a MOD GIRL wearing a metallic miniskirt outfit.

                                     ANDY WARHOL
                         Austin Powers?  Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.

                         Here, have this can of Campbell's 
                         Tomato Soup.

               Austin hands Andy a can of soup.

                                     ANDY WARHOL
                         I'm going to paint this can of soup 
                         and become famous and not give you

                         If you can become famous, everyone 
                         will have their fifteen minutes of

               HER MAJESTY, THE QUEEN is giving Austin a Victoria's Cross 
               like the Lyndon Johnson scene in Forrest Gump.  Behind them, 
               are two COLDSTREAM GUARDS and the DUKE OF EDINBURGH.

                                     QUEEN
                         Austin Powers, Britain owes you a 
                         debt of gratitude.

               Austin gives a cheeky look to Mrs. Kensington.

                                     QUEEN
                         I understand you were wounded.  Where 
                         were you hit?

                         In the but-tocks.

                         That must be a sight.  I'd kind of 
                         like to see that.

               Austin turns around, drops his pants, and shows his wounded 
               bum (matching Gump's) to the queen.

               The queen walks away.

               In the line-up we also see FOREST GUMP.  He has to pee very 
               badly.

                         Wait, I've got an idea.

               He PUNCHES a PRETTY MOD GIRL in the face, knocking her out 
               cold.

                         Austin, why in God's name did you 
                         strike that woman?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That ain't no woman!  It's a man, 
                         man.  It's one of Dr. Evil's 
                         assassins.

               Austin pulls off the mod girl's wig.  She is a MALE ASSASSIN.  
               The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet.

               Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him.  The assassin 
               hits the ground and pulls out a dagger.  Mrs. Kensington 
               kicks the knife out of his hand and Austin gets him in a 
               head-lock from behind.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where's Doctor Evil?

               ANGLE ON:  A FINGER WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE 
               FINGER PULLS THE TRIGGER OF A SPEAR

               gun.  The assassin falls forward.  A spear protrudes from 
               his back.  Austin sees Dr. Evil as he runs through a door.  
               They give chase.

               INT.  CLUB - BACK ROOM

               They enter.  Dr. Evil climbs into an egg chair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got you again, Dr. Evil!

               The chair fills with a WHITE MIST.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unseen, through mist)
                         Not this time.  Come, Mr.

                         See you in the future, Mr. Powers!

               Before the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair.  
               A sign on the egg reads "CRYOGENIC

               FREEZING BEGINNING."

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         My God!  He's freezing himself.

               Austin begins FIRING at the egg chair.  The ceiling opens up 
               and the egg rises through the opening.  Everything begins to

                         Austin Powers volunteered to have 
                         himself frozen, in the event Dr.

                         No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long-
                         since retired.  Ms. Kensington is 
                         her daughter.

               VANESSA KENSINGTON, Mrs. Kensington's daughter, beautiful, 
               mid-Twenties, English, enters.  She is wearing a very 
               conservative, business pantsuit.  Her hair is up and she 
               wears glasses.  Austin's breath is taken away.

               She sets down a huge stack of files.

                              (out loud, to himself)
                         My God, Vanessa's got a smashing 
                         body.  I bet she shags like a minx.  
                         How do I tell them that because of 
                         the unfreezing process, I have no 
                         inner monologue?
                              (pause)
                         I hope I didn't say that out loud 
                         just now.

               There is an uncomfortable SILENCE.

                         Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate 
                         you to the Nineties.  You know, a 
                         lot's changed since 1967.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, as long as people are still 
                         having promiscuous sex with many 
                         anonymous partners without protection, 
                         while at the same time experimenting 
                         with mind-expanding

               drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a 
               pound.

                                     VANESSA
                         My mother's told me all about you.

                                     AUSTIN
                         If it's a lie, goddamn her.  It it's 
                         the truth, goddamn me.
                              (pause)
                         God, I hope that's witty.  How's 
                         your mum?

                         My mother's doing quite well, thank 
                         you very much.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Yes, well...Agent Kensington will 
                         get you set up.  She's very dedicated.  
                         Perhaps, a little too dedicated.
                              (aside to Austin)
                         She's got a bit of a bug up her ass.  
                         Good luck, Austin, the world's 
                         depending on you.

                         favor and stop calling me baby.  You 
                         can address me as Agent Kensington.  
                         We have to leave immediately.  We've 
                         preserved your private jet just as 
                         you left it.  It's waiting at Heathrow

               The inside looks like Hugh Heffner's jet&emdash; rust shag 
               carpet, brown walls, and beads.  Austin and Vanessa sit on 
               beanbag chairs.  Vanessa works on her lap top.

                         Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?  How 
                         does a hot chick like you end up 
                         working at the Ministry of Defense?

                                     VANESSA
                         I went to Oxford and excelled in 
                         several subjects, but I ended up 
                         specializing in foreign languages.  
                         I wanted to travel -- see the world.  
                         In my last year I was accepted into 
                         the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies 
                         sector.  I thought I was off on an 
                         exciting career, but my job was to 
                         read everything printed in every 
                         country.  It's very boring.  My whole 
                         day is spent reading wedding 
                         announcements in Farsi.  If I do 
                         well with this case, I finally get 
                         promoted to field operative...

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, 
                         why don't we go into the back and 
                         shag?

                         I beg your pardon?

                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         man, I want to see if my bits and 
                         pieces are still working.

                         Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you 
                         must be a little confused, but we 
                         have a very serious situation at 
                         hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd 
                         concentrate on our mission and give 
                         your libido a rest.

                         We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.  
                         It's considered offensive.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's right.  You're supposed to 
                         say 'colored' now, right?

                         the sexy stews!

               The STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily.  
               One of them is a man and another wears braces.

                         Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'?  
                         We're called 'flight attendants' 
                         now, thank you very much.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a 
                         whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.

                         First of all, we're not wearing these.

                         you think...listen darling, I think 
                         you're a fabulous bird.  Can I get

                         Sure, it's easy to remember.
                              (writing on his hand)
                         It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare 
                         the craft for take-off now.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing!  When we land I'll give 
                         you a tinkle on the telling bone.

               The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits.

                         Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's 
                         two things I know about life: one, 
                         Americans will never take to soccer.  
                         Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses 
                         love to shag!

               They're shag-mad, man!  Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, 
               and be honest.

                                     VANESSA
                         Sure.

                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny?  Randy, you 
                         know.  To you, am I eros manifest?

                                     VANESSA
                         I hope this is part of the unfreezing 
                         process.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash; 
                         that's what I do, I swing.

                                     VANESSA
                         I understand that, Mr. Powers, but 
                         let me be perfectly clear with you, 
                         perhaps to the point of being 
                         insulting.  I will never have sex 
                         with you, ever.  If you were the 
                         last man on Earth and I was the last 
                         woman on Earth, and the future of 
                         the human race depended on our having 
                         sex simply for procreation, I still 
                         would not have sex with you.

               Austin is oblivious.

                         You've got mail!

               ANGLE ON:  the computer screen.  It's Basil Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Hello Austin.  Hello Vanessa.  This 
                         is Basil Exposition, from British 
                         Intelligence.

               There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think 
               may be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives 
               gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's 
               the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat 
               rooms.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you, Exposition.

                         Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning 
                         our final descent into Las Vegas 
                         International Airport.  Flight 
                         attendants will be coming by to 
                         collect your drinks, and I'll ask 
                         you at this time to please return to 
                         the main cabin and put your

               bean-bags in the upright position.

               Austin and Vanessa fasten the seatbelts on their bean bags.

               à la BOB FOSSE with a GO-GO GIRL in a bikini with the Austin

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face again unseen)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a 
                         long time, but I'm back.  It's all 
                         gone perfectly to plan except for 
                         one small flaw.  Because of a 
                         technical error, my right arm was 
                         not frozen.  I was therefore by 
                         definition only partially frozen.

               ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty, 
               eyes darting left and right.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But my design was perfect!  Your 
                         autonomic functions were shut down, 
                         and even though your arm wasn't 
                         frozen, the aging was retarded, 
                         therefore your right arm is only 
                         slightly older than the left.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Can't you see I'm only half a man?  
                         Look at me, I'm a freak!

               He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But Dr. Evil, all you need to do

                         it for twenty minutes a day.  A few 
                         months of that and it'll be just as 
                         strong as the other arm...

                                     DR. EVIL
                         And look what you've done to Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth!

               ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH

               who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair 
               around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself.

                         We could not anticipate feline 
                         complications due to the reanimation

                         Silence!

               ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT

               Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he 
               falls backwards into a pit.

                                     MUSTAFA

                         Ahhhhhhhhh!

                         Let this be a reminder to you all 
                         that this organization will not 
                         tolerate failure.

               MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY

               ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY 
               FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS

                         We've got a lot of work to do.

                         lot of pain.

                              (very frustrated)

                         form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me.

               He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it.

                         concerned that these children will

                              (pause)
                         It's a long story.

                         Finally, I come to my number two 
                         man.  His name:  Number Two.

               NUMBER TWO, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         For thirty years, Number Two has run 
                         Virtucon, the legitimate face of my 
                         evil empire.

               He hits a button.  The conference table slowly rotates to 
               reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted 
               by various miniature models.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Over the last thirty years, Virtucon 
                         has grown by leaps and bounds.  About 
                         fifteen years ago, we changed from 
                         volatile chemicals to the 
                         communication industry.  We own cable 
                         companies in thirty-eight states.

               The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         In addition to our cable holdings, 
                         we own a steel mill in Cleveland.

               A steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Shipping in Texas.

               A ship off the coast of Texas illuminates.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Oil refineries in Seattle.

               An oil refinery illuminates in Seattle.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         And a factory in Chicago that makes 
                         miniature models of factories.

               The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         We also own the Franklin mint, which 
                         makes decorative hand-painted theme 
                         plates for collectors.
                              (holds up plate)
                         Some plates, like the Gone With The 
                         Wind series, have gone up in value 
                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called 
                         blackmail.  The Royal Family of 
                         Britain are the wealthiest landowners 
                         in the world.  Either the Royal Family 
                         pays us an exorbitant amount of money, 
                         or we make it look like Prince 
                         Charles, the heir to the throne, has 
                         had an affair outside of marriage 
                         and, therefore, they would have to 
                         divorce.

               There is an uncomfortable silence.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did 
                         have an affair.  He admitted it, and 
                         they are now divorced, actually.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         People have to tell me these things.  
                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         throw me a bone here.
                              (pausing)
                         OK, no problem.  Here's my second 
                         plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a 
                         weather changing machine that was in 
                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a "laser."  Using 
                         this laser, we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around

               the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly 
               but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the 
               risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a 
               hefty ransom.

               There is another uncomfortable silence.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Umm, that also has already happened.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.
                              (pause)
                         Oh, hell, let's just do what we always 
                         do.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons 
                         and hold the world hostage.
                              (pause)
                         Gentlemen, it's come to my attention 
                         that a breakaway Russian Republic 
                         called Kreplachistan will be 
                         transferring a nuclear warhead to 
                         the United Nations in a few days.  
                         Here's the plan.  We get the warhead, 
                         and we hold the world ransom...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is an uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't you think we should ask for 
                         more than a million dollars?  A 
                         million dollars isn't that much money 
                         these days.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         All right then...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is another uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Virtucon alone makes over nine billion 
                         dollars a year.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pleasantly surprised)
                         Oh, really?
                              (slightly irritated)
                         One-hundred billion dollars.
                              (pause)
                         OK, make it happen.  Anything else?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Remember when we froze your semen, 
                         you said that if it looked like you 
                         weren't coming back to try and make 
                         you a son so that a part of you would 
                         live forever?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Well, after a few years, we got sort 
                         of impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you 
                         to meet your son.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         My son?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Yes.
                              (calling out)
                         Scott!

               SCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a 
               Kurt Cobain T-shirt.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Hi.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr. 
                         Evil.
                              (emotional)
                         I have a son!  I have a son!  
                         Everyone, I have a son!
                              (gesturing to globe)
                         Someday, Scott, this will all be 
                         yours.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I haven't seen you my whole life and 
                         now you show up and want a 
                         relationship?  I hate you!

               EXT.  JAGUAR - DRIVING - VEGAS - DAY

               Vanessa and Austin drive in his perfectly-preserved Jag.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing!

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a 
                         secure cellular phone, an on-board 
                         computer, and a Global Geosynchronous 
                         Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally, 
                         this.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various 
               dental hygiene products&emdash; floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, 
               dental mirror, and cleaning tool.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me guess.  The floss is garotte 
                         wire, the toothpaste contains plastic 
                         explosives, and the toothbrush is 
                         the detonation device.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, actually.  I don't know how to 
                         put this really.  Well, there have 
                         been fabulous advances in the field 
                         of dentistry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why?  What's wrong with my teeth?

               EXT.  VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT

               The Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door.

               INT.  VEGAS HOTEL ROOM

               Vanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin 
               takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite 
               suitcases.

                                     AUSITN
                         Which side of the bed do you want?

                                     VANESSA
                         You're going to sleep on the sofa.  
                         I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, 
                         that the only reason we're sharing a 
                         room is to support our cover story 
                         that we're a married couple on 
                         vacation.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, shall we shag now, or shall we 
                         shag later?  How do you like to do 
                         it?  Do you like to wash up first?  
                         Top and tails?  A whore's bath?  
                         Personally, before I'm on the job, I 
                         like to give my undercarriage a bit 
                         of a how's-your-father.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (off her angry reaction)
                         I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to 
                         get a rise out of you.

               They both laugh.

                                     VANESSA
                         Let's unpack.

               HER LUGGAGE:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents.  
               All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, nerd alert.

               shaver with huge English plug.

               iron and a Braun blow drier.

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle 
               of Jurgens lotion.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a 
               plastic baggie marked "Underthings" and her shoes in a baggie 
               marked "Shoes."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and 
               Hai Karate cologne.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a dossier labeled "Dr. Evil - 
               Top Secret."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump.  
               Vanessa sees it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's 
                         playing a prank on me!  Honestly, 
                         this isn't mine.

                                     VANESSA
                              (suffering)
                         I'm sure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think I'll give that stew a ding-a-
                         ling.

               Austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm.  
               After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the 
               handset.

                                     MOVIE PHONE VOICE
                              (through handset)
                         Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM!

               Austin covers the mouthpiece and whispers to Vanessa.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got her answering machine.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa walk through the casino.  Austin gives 
               PEOPLE two-handed handshakes.  They stare like he's a freak.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love Las Vegas, man.  Oh, I forgot 
                         my x-ray glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                         Here, use mine.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to use a cover name.  It's 
                         important that it be a generic name 
                         so that we don't draw attention to 
                         ourselves.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table.  Number Two 
               is there, complete with eyepatch.  On one side of him is a 
               beautiful ITALIAN WOMAN (a la SOPHIA LOREN) in a white dress 
               with a white kerchief on her head.  On the other side of him 
               is an extremely large-breasted BIMBO.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do you mind if I join you?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Not at all.

               The DEALER deals.

                                     DEALER
                         Seventeen.

               Zoom in on Number Two's eyepatch.

               NUMBER TWO'S MONOCULAR POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  We see everyone at the casino 
               in their underwear.  He looks at the next card in the shoe.  
               It is a 4.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hit me.

                                     DEALER
                         You have seventeen, sir.  The book 
                         says not to, sir.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I like to live dangerously.

               The dealer draws a card from the card shoe.

                                     DEALER
                         Four.  Twenty-one.

               Everyone at the table applauds.  The dealer deals to Austin 
               and Number Two.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Eighteen.
                              (to Number Two)
                         Sixteen.

               NUMBER TWO'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  He looks at the shoe at the 
               shoe and sees that the next card is a ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I'll stay.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

               Smugly, Austin puts on Vanessa's x-ray glasses.

               AUSTIN'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY SPECS".  Everyone is in their underwear, 
               but it is completely blurry.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

                                     VANESSA
                              (quietly)
                         What's wrong?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (quietly, to Vanessa)
                         I can't see a bloody thing.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're 
                         prescription X-ray glasses.  I have 
                         very bad astigmatism.

                                     DEALER
                         Sir, the table is waiting.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (panicking)
                         Uh, hit me.

               The table MURMURS.

                                     DEALER
                         On an eighteen, sir?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I also like to live dangerously.

               The dealer deals him the ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         You're very brave.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow 
                         myself to introduce...myself.  My 
                         name is Ritchie Cunningham.

               Vanessa is mortified.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (indicating Vanessa)
                         This is my wife, Enid.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My name is Number Two.

               He extends his hand to shake.  Austin extends his hand, but 
               misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.  There is an 
               awkward pause.  Austin takes off his glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                              (rescuing him)
                         Number Two?  That's an unusual name.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My parents were hippies.
                              (indicating Italian 
                              woman)
                         This is my Italian confidential 
                         secretary.

                                     ITALIAN WOMAN
                              (Italian accent)
                         My name is Alotta
                              (quickly)
                         Alotta Fagina.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it.  
                         It sounds like you're saying your 
                         name is a lot of...never mind.  
                         Listen, cats, I'm going to crash.  
                         It's been a gas.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Peace, baby.

               Austin and Vanessa leave.

               INT.  CASINO

                                     VANESSA
                         Why did you leave so soon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That cat Number Two has an X-ray 
                         eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him, 
                         man.  Listen, we should go back to 
                         the room, but first I have to go to 
                         the naughty chair and see a man about 
                         a dog.

               He heads to the rest room.

               INT.  HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO

               Number Two has been watching them.  He presses a BUTTON.

               INT.  BATHROOM - CASINO

               Austin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy 
               hat.  Austin enters a stall.  The Texan enters the adjoining 
               stall.

                                     TEXAN
                         Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy 
                         food, you rent it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Too right, youth.

               INT.  BATHROOM STALL

               Austin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing 
               Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks 
               back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it 
               around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the 
               wire and certain death.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (grunting)
                         Uh, uh!

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about 
               frantically.  He can hear the

               GRUNTING.

                                     TEXAN
                         Hey pardner, just relax, don't force 
                         it!  Use some creative visualization.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's 
               crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony.

                                     PATTY O'BRIEN
                              (groaning)
                         Ughhhhh...

               Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty 
               O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it 
               hovers above the toilet bowl.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who does Number Two work for?

                         That's right!  Show that turd who's 
                         boss!

                              (quietly, straining)
                         Go to hell.

               Austin drops Patty's head into the toilet and FLUSHES.  We 
               hear MUFFLED GURGLING SOUNDS from Patty O'Brien.

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan hears all of this, and is now concerned.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin reaches into Patty O'Brien's wallet.  We see his Dr. 
               Evil ID card and Alotta's Virtucon business card with her 
               address.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin is leaving his stall.  The Texan can see Patty 
               O'Brien's dead body head-first in the toilet.

                                     TEXAN
                         Jesus Christ, what did you eat?

               ANGLE ON THE FLOOR OF AUSTIN'S STALL

               Patty O'Brien's lifeless hand hits the floor.  The charms 
               come tumbling out: a heart, a moon, a star, and a clover.  A 
               second later, a blue diamond falls out.

               Vanessa is on the phone on the bed sifting through photos 
               and files on Dr. Evil, Virtucon, etc.

               In the background, through an open door, we see that Austin 
               is asleep on the couch.

               An older Mrs. Kensington sits in her suburban English front 
               room.

                         couch.

               In the background, we see Austin get off the couch.  He is 
               very naked and very hairy.  A strategically placed vase of 
               flowers blocks his naughty bits from view.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I'm proud of you.

                         Because you managed to resist Austin 
                         Power's charms.

               Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.  
               Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number 
               Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, God knows he tried, but I've 
                         been rather firm with him, Mummy.  
                         You didn't tell me he was so obsessed 
                         with sex.  It's bizarre.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         You can't judge him by modern 
                         standards.  He's very much a product 
                         of his times.  In my day he could 
                         have any woman he wanted.

                                     VANESSA
                         What about his teeth?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         You have to understand, in Britain 
                         in the Sixties you could be a sex 
                         symbol and still have bad teeth.  It 
                         didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         I just don't see it.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in 
                         his charms, it's impossible to get 
                         out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever...

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Of course not.  I was married to 
                         your father.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever want to?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Austin is very charming, very 
                         debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has 
                         a knowledge of fine wines, 
                         sophisticated, a world-renowned 
                         photographer.  Women want hin, men 
                         want to be him.  He's a lover of 
                         love&emdash; every bit an 
                         International Man of Mystery.

               We hear the TOILET FLUSH.  Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the 
               screen.

               Austin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED.  Vanessa 
               holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and 
               in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera.

                                     VANESSA
                         You didn't answer my question, Mum.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I know.  Let me just say this: Austin 
                         was the most loyal and caring friend 
                         I ever had.

               I will always love him.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Good morning, luv, who are you on 
                         the phone with?

                                     VANESSA
                              (to her mother)
                         Do you want to talk to him?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         No, it's been too long.  Best to 
                         leave things alone.

                                     VANESSA
                              (to Austin)
                         I'm on with a friend!
                              (to her mother)
                         Look, I'd better go.  I love you.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I love you, Vanessa.

               Vanessa hangs up.  Austin enters wearing an "Austin Powers" 
               robe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Good morning, Vanessa!  I hope you 
                         have on clean underwear.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     AUSTIN
                         We've got a doctor's 
                         appointment&emdash; an evil doctor's 
                         appointment.

               EXT.  VIRTUCON MAIN ENTRANCE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

               THROUGH BINOCULAR POV CUT-OUTS

               We see a black limousine pull up in front.  Random Task and 
               another BODYGUARD exit the limo and secure the area.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS - BUSHES

               We see that the binoculars belong to Vanessa.  She and Austin 
               are on a stakeout.  Austin's Jag is in the background.

                                     VANESSA
                         A limousine has just pulled up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me see.

               Austin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens 
               attached to his vintage camera.

               Two more BODYGUARDS leave the building and approach the limo.  
               Number Two exits the building

               holding Mr. Bigglesworth, the hairless cat.  He's not happy 
               about this, and has a scratch on his cheek.

                         cat.

                                     VANESSA
                         How do you know?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I never forget a pussy...cat.

                         Let's go get him!

                                     AUSTIN
                         He's too well-protected right now.

                                     VANESSA
                         We can't just sit here, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me tell you a story.  There's 
                         these two bulls on top of a hill 
                         checking out some foxy cows in the 
                         meadow below.  The young bull says, 
                         'hey, why don't we run down the hill 
                         and shag us a cow?', and the wise 
                         old bull replies, 'no, why don't we 
                         walk down the hill and shag all the 
                         cows?'

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't get it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, you know...cows, and shagging.

                                     VANESSA
                         Unfortunately, while you told that 
                         stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No worries, luv.  We'll just give 
                         Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

               He notices the way the desert light catches her beauty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly 
                         beautiful.  Stay right where you 
                         are.

               Austin changes lenses and begins SNAPPING PICTURES.

                                     VANESSA
                         I hate having my picture taken.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're crazy.  The camera loves you, 
                         Vanessa.

               Vanessa does a few coy poses.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Go, Vanessa, go!

               Vanessa lets go a little bit more.

               WHITE CYC

               Austin and Vanessa are in the midst of a full professional 
               photo shoot, and she's loving it.

               Austin begins SNAPPING pictures, all the while changing her 
               look, touching her hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me Vanessa.  Smashing!  Crazy.  
                         Give me some shoulder.
                              (pause)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

               He motions to her two top buttons of her blouse.  She nods 
               no.  Austin nods yes.  She sheepishly undoes them.  A MONTAGE 
               of her in various gowns, one more exotic and exciting than 
               the other.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Show me love.  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         Smashing!

               Vanessa is flanked by two buff MALE MODELS à la Madonna.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great!  Great!  Smashing!
                              (beat)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No!  No!

               Love it.  Give me love.  Give me mouth.  Give me lips.

                                     (BEAT)
                         Going in very close now.

               He goes in closer.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me eyes.
                              (closer)
                         Give me cornea.
                              (closer)
                         Give me aqueous humour.
                              (closer)
                         Coming in closer.  Give me retina, 
                         Vanessa.
                              (closer)
                         Even closer.  Give me optic nerve.
                              (beat)
                         Love it!
                              (beat)
                         And...done.

               He throws the camera down.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm spent.  What say you we go out 
                         on the town?

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT

               Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double-
               decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner.  
               They're drinking champagne.

               Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding 
               his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point 
               to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it 
               to her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fancy a nibble?

                                     VANESSA
                         I couldn't have another bite.

               They laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them.

               They begin to dance.

               Austin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT

               They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying 
               each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She 
               graciously accepts.

               64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE

               Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of 
               backgrounds&emdash; neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, 
               etc.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM

               Sounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking 
               out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled 
               leg straining upwards.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Watch out, you're on my hair!

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Sorry.  Move your hand to the left.  
                         There you go.  Gorgeous.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Go!  Just go!

               We hear a SPINNING SOUND.

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Left hand, blue.

               We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She 
               reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait a tick, I forgot something in 
                         the lobby.
                              (moving behind the 
                              couch)
                         I know what.  I'll take the stairs.

               Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe I'll take the escalator.

               Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why take the escalator when I could 
                         take a canoe?

               Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch.

                                     VANESSA
                         I haven't had fun like that since 
                         college.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry that bug up your ass had 
                         to die.

               She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound.

                                     VANESSA
                         Always wanting to have fun, that's 
                         you in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, this is me in a nutshell.

               Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind 
                         of nut has such a big nutshell?  How 
                         did I get into this bloody great big 
                         nutshell?

               Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're smashed, Vanessa.

                                     VANESSA
                         I am not.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes you are.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm 
                         always the designated driver.

               They are both on the bed.  She looks at him.  He looks at 
               her.  There is an awkward silence.

               She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't.  You're drunk.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just 
                         beginning to see what my Mum was 
                         talking about.
                              (pause)
                         What was my mother like back in the 
                         Sixties?  I'm dying to know.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (sentimental)
                         She was very groovy.  She was so in 
                         love with your Dad.  If there was 
                         one

               other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and 
               treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me.  But, 
               unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.

               Austin hears SNORING.  He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep.  
               A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a

               RED LIGHT FLASHES.

               Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE 
               PHONE.  It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on the picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin, this is Basil 
                         Exposition from British Intelligence.  
                         Thank you for confirming the link 
                         between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find 
                         out what part Virtucon plays in 
                         something called Project Vulcan.  
                         I'll need you and Vanessa to get on 
                         that immediately.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Right away, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Where is Vanessa, by the way?

               Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         She's working on another lead right 
                         now.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Then you'll have to go it alone.  
                         Good luck.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you, Basil.

                              (knowing)
                         Yes?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Let me remind you that because of 
                         the unfreezing process you might 
                         experience flatulence at moments of 
                         extreme relaxation.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes.  Thank you.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         There's one more thing, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Be careful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you.

               Austin looks at Alotta's Virtucon business card.

               INT.  ALOTTA'S JAPANESE STYLE PENTHOUSE

               Austin is in a dark penthouse suite.  Austin passes a piece 
               of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Paging Dr. Freud.

               He goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase.  He 
               opens it.

               FULL SCREEN - DOCUMENT

               Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature 
               camera/pendant.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (photographing)
                         Give it to me baby.  Super.

               We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's 
               holdings in a flow-chart fashion.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Pout for me, luv.  Smashing.  Yes!  
                         Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!

               One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects."  Under 
               that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie", 
               and in CLOSE-UP&emdash; "Project Vulcan."

               We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a 
               cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core."

                                     AUSTIN
                         And I'm spent.

               The front door opens.  It's Alotta.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You seem surprised to see me.

                                     ALOTTA
                         I thought you'd quit while you were 
                         ahead.

                                     AUSTIN
                         What, and watch all my earnings go...
                              (smug)
                         Down the toilet?

                                     ALOTTA
                         What do you want, Mr...Cunningham, 
                         was it?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I 
                         call you Alotta...
                              (pause)
                         Please?

                                     ALOTTA
                         You may.

                         Your boss, Number Two, I understand 
                         that cat's involved in big underground 
                         drills.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Virtucon's main interest is in cable 
                         television, but they do have a 
                         subterranean construction division, 
                         yes.  How did you know?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (smug)
                         I didn't, baby, you just told me.

                                     ALOTTA
                         It's for the mining industry, Mr. 
                         Cunningham.  We can talk about 
                         business later.  But first, let me 
                         slip into something more comfortable.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Behave!

               MUSIC:  "The Look of Love" by SERGIO MENDEZ AND BRAZIL 66 
               Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she 
               takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair 
               of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto.

               INT.  JAPANESE BATH

               She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on 
               her shoulder, and enters the water.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Come in.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'd rather talk about Number Two.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?  
                         Come in, and I'll show you everything 
                         you need to know.

               Austin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He 
               goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over.

                                     ALOTTA
                         May I wash you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy.

               She washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his 
               wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION.  
               It reads "AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY."

               ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC.  
               SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS

               trousers.

                                     ALOTTA
                         In Japan, men come first and women 
                         come second.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Or sometimes not at all.

                         Care for some saki?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sak-i it to me!

               Alotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her 
               ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation 
               Pills."  She drops two PILLS into his drink.

               Austin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly 
               woozy.

                                     ALOTTA
                         How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation.

               A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin.

                                     AUSTIN

                         'Pardon me for being rude, It was 
                         not me, it was my food.

               It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down 
               below.'

                                     ALOTTA
                         That's very clever.  Do you know any 
                         other poems?

                         we make love.  But first, tell me 
                         another poem.

                         I think it was Wordsworth who penned 
                         this little gem:  'Press the button, 
                         pull the chain, out comes a chocolate 
                         choo-choo train.'

                         love, you silly, hairy little man.

               Dr. Evil, Number Two, and Frau Farbissina sit at the large

                         Austin Powers is getting too close.  
                         He must be neutralized.  Any 
                         suggestions?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Ya wohl&emdash; I mean, yes wohl, 
                         Herr Doctor.  I have created the 
                         ultimate weapon to defeat Austin 
                         Powers.  Bring on the Fembots!

                         Breathtaking, Frau.  These automated 
                         strumpets are the perfect bait for 
                         the degenerate Powers.

                         These are the latest word in android 
                         replicant technology.  Lethal, 
                         efficient, brutal.  And no man can 
                         resist their charms.  Send in the 
                         soldiers!

               SEVEN SOLDIERS come in.  They are immediately attracted to 
               the FEMBOTS.  They throw down their guns and come to the 
               girls zombie-like.

               When they get within range, guns POP out of the Fembots' 
               bras and begin FIRING, killing the guards.

                         Quite impressive.

                         I like to see girls of that caliber.  
                         By caliber, I mean both the barrel 
                         size of their guns and the high

               Dr. Evil and Number Two watch a large screen.  We see stock

                         The warhead is ours.  Let Phase Two

               They all look up at the SCREEN.

                         In a little while, you'll find out 
                         that the Kreplachistani warhead has 
                         gone missing.  Well, it's in safe 
                         hands.  If you want it back, you'll 
                         have to pay me...ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

               The UN representatives are confused.  Number Two COUGHS.

                         one

               hundred billion dollars.  If you fail to do so, we'll set 
               off the warhead and destroy the world.

                         hmn.

               There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should 
               have FADED TO BLACK.  The evil associates look around the 
               room, not knowing what to do with themselves.

                         Okay...Well...I think I'm going to 
                         watch some TV.

                         Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up 
                         to speed.  Dr. Evil has high-jacked 
                         a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan 
                         and is holding the world ransom for 
                         one-hundred billion dollars.  If the 
                         world doesn't pay up in four days, 
                         he's threatening to destroy the world.

                         Thank you, Exposition.  Only two 
                         things, scare me, and one is nuclear

                         have a warhead, it's quite another 
                         thing to have the missiles to launch 
                         it.

                         Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. 
                         Exposition.  She's in from Tunbridge 
                         Wells

               in Kent.  Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old?

               Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         My God, Austin, what have you done?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not your mother, that's a 
                         man!

               Austin begins tugging on her hair.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                         Owww...my hair!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Get away from my mother!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, have you gone mad?

               The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                              (through pain)
                         Who is that man?  Why did he hit me?

                                     BASIL EXPOSIION
                         Don't worry, mother.  Lie down.  
                         Austin, you have a lot of explaining 
                         to do.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was 
                         a man.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Damn it, man!  You're talking about 
                         my mother!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You must admit, she is rather mannish.  
                         No offense, but if that's a woman, 
                         it looks like she's been beaten with 
                         an ugly stick.

                                     VANESSA
                         Really, Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Look at her hands, baby!  Those are 
                         carpenter's hands.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         All right, Austin, I think you should 
                         go.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think if everyone were honest, 
                         they'd confess that the lady looks 
                         exactly like a man in drag.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm leaving!
                              (pause)
                         Oh, and Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, Basil?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Be careful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks.

               Basil escorts his mother out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, may I have a word with you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Listen, I know I'm just being 
                         neurotic, but I can't shake this 
                         suspicious

               feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I 
               don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad 
               relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues.  
               You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to 
               give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this 
               weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't be sorry.  You're right to be 
                         suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged 
                         her rotten.

                                     VANESSA
                              (stunned)
                         I can't believe you made love to her 
                         just like that.  Did you use 
                         protection?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, I had my nine-millimeter 
                         automatic.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, did you use a condom?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Only sailors use condoms, man.

                                     VANESSA
                         Not in the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well they should, filthy beggars, 
                         they go from port to port.  Alotta 
                         meant nothing to me.

                                     VANESSA
                              (pause)
                         Well, it means something to me.  If 
                         you want us to have a relationship, 
                         you've got to be a one-woman man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're 
                         everything to me.

                                     VANESSA
                         You just don't get it, do you, Austin?  
                         Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties, 
                         you're going to be very lonely.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin 
               looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a 
               list of names crossed out, with

               comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see 
               "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama 
               Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, 
               Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

               Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.  
               He picks up his new pair&emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER 
               PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

               Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We 
               see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S 
               and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

               Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened 
               Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It 
               explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

               He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The 
               NOISE is awful.

               Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head 
               ripped off, and blood spews out.

               Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too 
               loose and water shoots all around the bathroom.

               EXT.  CAR - STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

               Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of 
               Las Vegas.

               INT.  CASINO BAR - NIGHT

               Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY 
               YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a 
               freak.

               Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down 
               with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin 
               is pleased.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Austin sits watching the TIME-LIFE The Last Thirty Years 
               video on TV.  Vanessa enters.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thirty years of political and social 
                         upheaval.  The fall of the Berlin 
                         wall, a female Prime Minister of 
                         England, the abolishment of Apartheid, 
                         a fascinating tapestry of human strum 
                         und drang.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was 
                         gay.  Women loved him, man.  I didn't 
                         see that one coming.

                                     VANESSA
                         Basil was very concerned to know 
                         where you were last night.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Out and about, doing odds and sods.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'll tell him.  By the way, I've 
                         decided we should keep our 
                         relationship strictly professional.

               INT.  THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

               We're in the middle of a group therapy session, containing 
               six or seven FATHERS with their teenage SONS.  It is 
               emotionally charged.  A lot of pained expressions and coffee 
               in Styrofoam cups.

                                     SON 1
                              (crying)
                         I love you, Dad.

                                     DAD 1
                         I love you, Son.

               They hug.  Everyone APPLAUDS.  We see Dr. Evil and Scott.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave.  
                         Thank you.  OK, group, we have two 
                         new member.  Say hello to Scott and 
                         his father, Mr....Ehville?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

                                     GROUP
                         Hello, Dr. Evil.  Hello, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (into it)
                         Hello, everybody.

                                     THERAPIST
                         So, Scott, why don't we start with 
                         you.  Why are you here?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, it's kind of weird.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't judge here.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         OK.  Well, I just really met my Dad 
                         for the first time three days ago.  
                         He was partially frozen for thirty 
                         years.  I never knew him growing up.  
                         He comes back and now he wants me to 
                         take over the family business.

                                     THERAPIST
                         And how do you feel about that?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't wanna take over the family 
                         business.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         But Scott, who's going to take over 
                         the world when I die?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Not me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         What do you want to do, Scott?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't know.  I was thinking, maybe 
                         I'd be a vet or something, cause I 
                         like animals and stuff.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil vet?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No.  Maybe, like, work in a petting 
                         zoo or something.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil petting zoo?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (shouting)
                         You always do that!
                              (calm)
                         Anyways, this is really hard, because, 
                         you know, my Dad is really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't label people here, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No, he's really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Scott.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, the boy's right.  I really am 
                         evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Don't be so hard on yourself.  You're 
                         here, that's what's important.  A 
                         journey of a thousand miles begins 
                         with one step.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I just think, like, he hates me.  I 
                         really think he wants to kill me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         OK, Scott, no one really wants to 
                         "kill" anyone here.  They say it, 
                         but they don't mean it.

               The group LAUGHS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, the boy's quite astute.  I 
                         am trying to kill him.  My Evil 
                         Associates have cautioned against 
                         it, so here he is, unfortunately, 
                         alive.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We've heard from Scott, now let's 
                         hear from you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         The details of my life are quite 
                         inconsequential.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That's not true, Doctor.  Please, 
                         tell us about your childhood.

                                     GROUP
                         Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Very well, where should I begin?  My 
                         father was a relentlessly self-
                         improving boulangerie owner from 
                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy 
                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother 
                         was a fifteen-year-old French 
                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed 
                         feet.  My father would womanize, he 
                         would drink, he would make outrageous 
                         claims, like he invented the question 
                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse 
                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of 
                         general malaise that only the genius 
                         possess and the insane lament.  My 
                         childhood was typical.

               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make 
               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap 
               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the 
               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically 
               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn 
               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical 
               school.  From there...

               ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned.

               EXT.  VIRTUCON HIGH RISE - NEXT MORNING

               INT.  HALLWAY - VIRTUCON

               A TOUR is in progress.  Austin, Vanessa, and other TOURISTS 
               ride on an electric tram.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a 
                         rancid taste in my mouth.  Do you 
                         have a piece of gum?

                                     VANESSA
                              (in her own world)
                         Do you think she's prettier than I?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who?

                                     VANESSA
                         You know who.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No!  Don't lay your hang-ups on me, 
                         Vanessa.  You're being very trippy.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm looking at you, and the whole 
                         time I can't help thinking you had 
                         your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

                                     AUSTTIN
                         Well put.  Listen love, we can't 
                         keep having this fight.  I'm an 
                         International Man of Mystery.  
                         Sometimes in the course of my work 
                         to save the world I have to shag 
                         some crumpet.  It's all part of the 
                         job.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Welcome to Virtucon, the company of 
                         the future.
                              (pointing to large 
                              display window)
                         Virtucon is a leading manufacturer 
                         of many items you'll find right in 
                         your own home.  We make steel, 
                         volatile chemicals, petroleum-based 
                         products, and we also own the Franklin 
                         mint, which makes decorative hand-
                         painted theme plates for collectors.
                              (holds up plate)
                         Some plates, like the Gone With The 
                         Wind series, have gone up in value 
                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

               The people on the tour APPLAUD.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Coming up on the left, we have the 
                         Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide 
                         range of Virtucon licensed products.  
                         On the right, you'll notice a door 
                         that leads to a restricted area.  
                         Only authorized personnel are allowed 
                         beyond that point.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA

               All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a 
               SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with 
               a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear 
               Virtucon coveralls.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll take him, you take her.

               The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; 
               the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin 
               and Vanessa follow.

               We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING 
               KNOCKED OUT.

               Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls 
               over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.   
               They go through the doors into the restricted area.

               INT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

               They approach the security GUARD.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, we don't look anything like 
                         our photo badges.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a 
                         mind control technique during my 
                         travels to India.  I learned it from 
                         my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a 
                         chaste man who mysteriously died of 
                         a disease that had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis.

               Just watch me.  Watch me, now.

               They reach the guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Hi, folks.  You're entering a 
                         restricted zone.  Can I see your 
                         security badges?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               They flash their security badges to the guard.

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, 
               RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE

               other, back and forth.

               MUSIC:  Mystical Indian sitar.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hypnotist-like)
                         Everything seems to be in order.

                                     GUARD
                              (looking at the badges)
                         Hey, wait a minute&emdash;

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  He redoubles his eye-brow-raising.

                                     GUARD
                              (trance-like, in 
                              Austin's English 
                              accent)
                         Everything seems to be in order.

                                     VANESSA
                         That's amazing.  Let's go!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on one second.

               Austin again does his mind control trick.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

                                     GUARD
                              (in trace)
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

               He hands Austin a piece of gum.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't mind if I do.

                                     GUARD
                              (slipping out of trance)
                         Hey!  Wait a minute, that's my last 
                         piece of gum.

               Austin does his mind-control again.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     GUARD
                              (trance-like)
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (mind-controlling)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

                                     VANESSA
                              (irritated)
                         Austin, we have to go!

               She pulls him away.

                                     GUARD (O.S.)
                              (faintly)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

               Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked "PROJECT VULCAN - 
               TOP SECRET."  They walk through.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               Inside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits 
               surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         This is the strongest, sharpest drill 
                         bit ever produced by man.  It weighs 
                         fifteen metric tones and can bore 
                         through a mile-thick bedrock of solid 
                         granite in seven seconds.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM

               A SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count.  They 
               notice Austin and Vanessa's empty seats on the tram.  The 
               guard speaks into his walkie-talkie.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               SFX:  ALARM GOES OFF

                                     ANNOUNCER

                         Attention, there are intruders in 
                         the complex.

               All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin 
               and Vanessa.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         Get them!

               The scientist approach.  Austin knocks two of them out cold 
               with judo chops.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks.  
               SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.  Austin 
               and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads 
               "VIRTUCON

               STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY."

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a 
               large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test 
               track very slowly.

               Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving 
               steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin 
               fanning out in a search.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Our only way out of here is to drive 
                         out!

               They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER, 
               push him off, and assume the controls.

                                     P.A. (O.S.)
                         There they are!

               Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.  
               Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.  
               Austin punches the other one off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hang on!  I'm going to floor it!

               He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster.

               TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They 
               are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a 
               fast-approaching car.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where did you learn to shoot?

                                     VANESSA
                         Where did you learn to drive?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY 
               AS IF "IN THE NICK OF TIME."  THE

               steamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still 
               frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, watch out!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Where?  Where?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE 
               STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS

               away.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING 
               THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO

               downshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along 
               with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks.

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE 
               STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF

               blood and guts.

               By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run 
               out into the hallway.

               INT.  HALLWAY

               The coast is clear.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thank God, Austin, we made it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, act naturally and we'll split 
                         this scene the way we came in, 
                         Vanessa.

               From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is 
               Random Task flanked by four SECURITY

               GUARDS.

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               We see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood 
               and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns 
               to reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on 
               his jumpsuit.

               Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and 
               dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled 
               Army guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN."

               EXT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES

               It is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house.  We 
               hear a PHONE RINGING.

               INT.  KITCHEN

               A pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone.

                                     MIDDLE AGED LADY
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, that's right, he's a henchman 
                         in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
                              (pause)
                         What?  Killed?
                              (pause)
                         How?
                              (pause)
                         Run over by a steamroller?  Oh my 
                         God.  Thank you for calling.

               She HANGS UP.  A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters.

                                     FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
                         Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home?  
                         He said he was going to teach me to 
                         play ball.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Sit down, Billy, I have some bad 
                         news.  As you know, your brother 
                         Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's 
                         Private Army.

                                     BILLY
                         Was?  What is it, Mom?

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Your brother was run over by a 
                         steamroller.

                                     BILLY
                         A steamroller?
                              (bursting into tears)
                         No, not Steve!  Since Dad died, 
                         Steve's been like a father to me.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         I'm sorry son.  People never think 
                         how things affect the family of the 
                         henchman.
                              (hugging him)
                         I love you, Billy.
                              (to herself, out loud)
                         I wonder if we'll be able to receive 
                         Steve's henchman's comp.

               We see a Virtucon electric minivan humning along.

               INT.  BACK OF ELECTRIC MINIVAN

               Austin and Vanessa are unconscious.

               EXT.  HIGHWAY

               The electric minivan turns onto a dirt road that leads to a 
               boulder.

               EXT.  DESERT - BOULDER

               The boulder lifts up and the minivan drives into it.

               INT.  UNDERGROUND TUNNEL

               The minivan enters a long cylindrical tunnel.

               INT.  FREIGHT ELEVATOR

               The minivan is being lowered on a high-speed elevator.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER

               VIRTUCON ARMY MEMBERS keep watch.  SCIENTISTS check 
               clipboards.

                         Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.

               The electric minivan pulls up right next to the immense table.  
               All the evil associates are present.  Dr. Evil squeezes a 
               tennis ball repeatedly.  Frau Farbissina opens the rear hatch 
               of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. 
                         Powers.  Mrs. Kensington's daughter, 
                         how lovely.  I believe your name is 
                         Vanessa?  I'd shake your hands, except 
                         for obvious reasons.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't understand.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         My hand, dammit!  Look at it!

                                     AUSTIN
                         What's wrong with your hand?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't try to suck up to me!  It's a 
                         little late for that.  I'm a freak!

               Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

               He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually 
               normal, just slightly aged.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking 
                         your head space.

                         the international stage, Mr. Powers, 
                         I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the 
                         curtain fall on the third and final 
                         act.

               He presses a button on his chair panel.  A giant canvas falls, 
               unveiling an ultra-high tech diamond-bladed subterranean 
               bore&emdash; the VULCAN.  It is rather phallic.

                         So powerful it can penetrate the

                         He's only got one warhead and he's 
                         going to detonate it deep underground.

               The screen goes BLACK.

                         Come join us for dinner, won't you 
                         Mr. Powers?

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

               Austin and Vanessa are seated at a table with Frau.  WAITERS 
               serve food.

               MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I think you'll enjoy the food.  I 
                         have the best chef in the world.  
                         His name is Ezekial.  He's made of 
                         seventy-five percent plastic.

               Scott enters.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott my boy, come here.  How was 
                         your day?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, me and a buddy went to the 
                         video arcade in town and, like, they 
                         don't speak English right, and so my 
                         buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 
                         'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't 
                         speak French or whatever', and the 
                         other guy goes something in Paris 
                         talk, and I go 'um, just back off' 
                         and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make 
                         me'.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (trying to hide 
                              contempt)
                         Fascinating.  What are your plans 
                         for this evening?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good 
                         tittie movie on Skinemax.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         And that's how you want to live your 
                         life, is it?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Yeah.  What?

               ANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS THAT HAS EVERYONE'S NAMES ON IT.  
               DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE

               button labeled "SCOTT."  Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's 
                         nemesis, Austin Powers.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Why are you feeding him?  Why don't 
                         you just kill him?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         In due time.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         But what if he escapes?  Why don't 
                         you just shoot him?  What are you 
                         waiting for?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have a better idea.  I'm going to 
                         put him in an easily-escapable 
                         situation involving an overly-
                         elaborate and exotic death.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Why don't you just shoot him now?  
                         Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just 
                         shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         One more peep out of you and you're 
                         grounded.  Let's begin.

               A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil 
               hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of 
                         mine are joining us for dinner.

               They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal.

               The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts 
               them in the dipping mechanism.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil, do you really expect them 
                         to pay?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to 
                         die.  Even after they pay me the 
                         money, I'm still going to melt all 
                         the cities of the world with hot 
                         magma.
                              (to guard)
                         All right, guard, begin the 
                         unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping 
                         Mechanism.

               The guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly 
               towards the surface of the water.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Release the sharks!
                              (to the room)
                         All the sharks have had laser beams 
                         attached to their heads.  I figure 
                         every creature deserves a warm meal.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                              (clearing her throat 
                              nervously)
                         Dr. Evil?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting 
                         my moment of triumph.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         It's about the sharks.  Since you 
                         were frozen, they've been placed on 
                         the Endangered Species List.  We 
                         tried to get some, but it will take 
                         months to clear up the red tape.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (disappointed)
                         Right.
                              (to Austin)
                         Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you 
                         in a tank of piranhas with laser 
                         beams attached to their heads.

               Frau clears her throat again.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What is it now?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Well, we experimented with lasers, 
                         but you would be surprised at how 
                         heavy they are.  They actually 
                         outweighed the piranha themselves, 
                         and the fish, well, they sank to the 
                         bottom and died.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have one simple request&emdash; 
                         sharks with friggin' laser beams 
                         attached to their heads, and it can't 
                         be done?  Remind me again why I pay 
                         you people?

               What do we have?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         They're mutated sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?  Are they ill-tempered?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Please allow me to demonstrate.

               Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope 
               towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch 
               through the air.  The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls 
               the rope back.  The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill-
                         tempered sea bass it is.
                              (to the room)
                         Come, let's return to dinner.  Close 
                         the tank.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Aren't you going to watch them?  
                         They'll get away!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, we'll leave them alone and not 
                         actually witness them dying, and 
                         we'll just assume it all went to 
                         plan.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I have a gun in my room.  Give me 
                         five seconds, I'll come back and 
                         blow their brains out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No Scott.  You just don't get it, do 
                         you?

               Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the 
               tank.

               INT.  TANK AREA

               Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They 
               can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.

                                     VANESSA
                         What's your plan?

               Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing 
               Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         First, I plan to soil myself.  Then, 
                         I plan to regroup and think about 
                         the next move.  Any thoughts?

                                     VANESSA
                         Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep 
                         this on me just in case.

               She pulls out a container of dental floss.

                                     AUSTIN
                         All right, I get it.  I have bad 
                         teeth.  You have to understand, in 
                         Britain in the Sixties you could be 
                         a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.  
                         It didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, no, no.  We'll use the floss to 
                         get to the ledge.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing idea!  Give it to me.

               Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.  
               He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches 
               like a grappling hook.

               Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  
               Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the 
               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, 
               the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his 
               hand like a surgeon&emdash;

               Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile 
               the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the 
               open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES 
               at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!

               Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of 
               toothpaste into the guard's eyes.

                                     GUARD
                              (screaming, rubbing 
                              his eyes)
                         My eyes!  My eyes!

               Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing 
               both ends.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on, Vanessa!

               She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety 
               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.  
               Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face.

               He and Austin STRUGGLE.

               The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's 
               head dangling over the water.  SEA

               BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's 
               head.

                                     VANESSA
                              (shouting)
                         Austin, watch out!

               Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's

                         That's not the way to get ahead in 
                         life.

               BUSTY WAITRESSES.

               INT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT

               At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, 
               scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer.

                                     GUY 1
                         I can't believe John Smith is getting 
                         married tomorrow.

                                     GUY 2
                         Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not 
                         like him to be late for anything, 
                         especially his own stag party.

                                     GUY 3
                         Well, you know he's a henchman for 
                         Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late.  
                         Can I just say something that may 
                         sound a little sappy?  I think it's 
                         a testament to our friend John that 
                         so many of his buddies showed up in 
                         his honor.  There's a lot of love in 
                         this room.

               A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.

                         Hi, I have a phone call here for the 
                         John Smith party.

                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
                              (pause)
                         That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's 
                         private army.
                              (pause)
                         What?  He's dead?
                              (pause)
                         Decapitated by mutated flying sea 
                         bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you.

               He hangs up.

                         Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that 
                         John?  Is he coming late?

                                     GUY 1
                         Guys, John's not coming.

                         Why?

                                     GUY 1
                         He was decapitated by mutated flying 
                         sea bass.

               perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth.  Austin smokes the

               Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are 
               aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, 
               and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.

               lying on the floor, smoking.  Just then, Vanessa enters, 
               flanked by a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS.  She surveys the scene and 
               looks at Austin in his briefs.  She's hurt.  The commandos 
               salute Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.
                              (to the commandos)
                         At ease, boys.

                                     VANESSA
                              (glancing down)
                         Likewise.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can explain.  They attacked me.  
                         Gas came out of her...well, and then 
                         they...and I...

                                     VANESSA
                         I believe you, Austin.  Let's go.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on a tick, let me put on my 
                         togs.

               INT.  MAIN CHAMBER

               Austin and Vanessa lead FIFTEEN COMMANDOS into the chamber 
               and GUNFIRE breaks out.  Two CATWALKS run the length of the 
               chamber, meeting at the door to the control area.

               The commandos split into two groups and lob grenades at the 
               PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS who are guarding the stairs leading to 
               the catwalks.  They go flying.

               INT.  CONTROL AREA

               The ALARM goes off.

               Metal shutters automatically cover the windows overlooking 
               the probe mechanism.

                         Launch the subterranean probe!

               The giant probe engine begins to throb and whirl.  The tip 
               of the spinning probe suddenly strikes the floor of the 
               chamber and burrows into the earth with atomic force.  Smoke 
               and debris explode upwards.  The entire chamber quakes 
               violently&emdash; eight on the Richter scale.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER

               Austin, Vanessa, and three commandos are pinned down behind 
               several VIRTUCON BARRELS

               INT.  CATWALK

               Another FOUR GUARDS block their way.  Austin goes to shoot, 
               but he's out of bullets.

                                     SFX:  CLICKA-CLICKA
                         Austin and Vanessa run along the 
                         catwalk towards the control room.  
                         They're directly in the path of TEN 
                         CHARGING PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Follow me!  We're going to have to 
                         jump over the rail!

                                     VANESSA
                         Are you crazy?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't worry!

               ANGLE ON SIDE SHOT OF CATWALK

               They continue to run towards the guards behind some STACKED 
               BARRELS.  Two OBVIOUS STUNT DOUBLES run out from behind the 
               barrels in a continuous motion instead of Austin and Vanessa 
               and diver over the rail.

               ANGLE ON THE OTHER TEAM OF COMMANDOS

               They are making progress on the other catwalk.

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA

               They have landed safely, but are surrounded by FIVE PRIVATE 
               ARMY SOLDIERS, armed to the teeth&emdash;

               one has a bazooka, one has a flamethrower, one has a Gatling 
               gun, etc.  They see Austin and throw down their weapons, 
               pulling out KNIVES.

               One of the private soldiers runs at Austin and he stabs him.  
               Another soldier runs at Austin, and Austin also stabs him.  
               A third private army soldier runs at Austin.  Austin does 
               the stabbing motion.

                         Blast!  Out of ammo.

               Vanessa unleashes a series of kicks, knocking them all out.

               INT.  CONTROL ROOM

               Austin begins to enter.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, I'm coming with you.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa.  
                         I have a follow-up visit with the 
                         Evil Doctor.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'll secure the perimeter.

               INT.  CONTROL AREA

               Austin enters the control area.  A VIRTUCON ARMY MAN fires 
               at him.  Austin returns fires, shooting up some electrical 
               equipment.  Live wires dangle dangerously.  Austin sees Mr.

               Bigglesworth running out a read door.

                                     DR. EVIL (O.S.)
                         Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

               Austin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE 
               FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned 
               computers labeled "DESTRUCTACON 5000".

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the 
                         Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed 
                         to prevent you from progressing beyond 
                         this point.  You might as well 
                         surrender.  Resistance is futile.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, Destructacon 5000, you have 
                         quite a head on your shoulders, I 
                         dare to coin.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Yes, I am programmed to answer any 
                         question.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really?  Let me ask you this.  What 
                         is love?

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         That does not compute.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why not?  It's a question.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Love is...love is...love is...

               The computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

               There is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin 
               passes through the force field and heads for the door until 
               he hears&emdash;

               He begins looking furiously for the abort button.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to Eastern European 
                              Man)
                         Where's the abort button?

               The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say 
               'give me one second.'

                                     EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN

                              (to Austin)
                         It's right over there.

               Austin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just 
               then, Random Task enters.  Austin sees him and goes to shoot 
               him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off 
               his SHOE.

               Austin makes his way across the room to the button.

               Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.

               ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR

               The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe 
               has not killed him.  It has just hurt him slightly.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to 
                         have a lump there, you idiot!  Who 
                         throws a shoe?  You fight like a 
                         woman.

                         Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting.

               Random task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands 
               there, menacing, missing one shoe.

               Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin 
               is a Big Gulp.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for a drink?

               Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in 
               front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels 
               through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING 
               him.

               He begins to SMOKE, and then dies.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shocking.

               Austin dives in SLOW MOTION towards the abort button.  He 
               flies through the air for an inordinate length of time.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (slow motion distortion)

               His hand lands on the button.

               Having saved the world, Austin picks up a MACHIEN GUN from a 
               fallen Private Army guy and runs to the door at the back, 
               chasing Dr. Evil.

               Austin bursts in, catching Dr. Evil packing a suitcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got you, Dr. Evil!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well done, Mr. Powers.  We're not so 
                         different, you and I.  It's true, 
                         you're British, and I'm Belgian.  
                         You have a full head of hair, mine 
                         is slightly receding.  You're thin, 
                         I'm about forty pounds overweight.  
                         OK, we are different, I'm not making 
                         a very good point.  However, isn't 
                         it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very 
                         things you stand for&emdash; swinging, 
                         free love, parties, distrust of 
                         authority- are all now, in the 
                         Nineties, considered to

               be...evil?  Maybe we have more in common than you care to 
               admit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, man, what we swingers were 
                         rebelling against were uptight squares 
                         like you, whose bag was money and 
                         world domination.  We were innocent, 
                         man.  If we'd known the consequences 
                         of our sexual liberation, we would 
                         have done things differently, but 
                         the spirit would have remained the 
                         same.  It's freedom, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Your freedom has cause more pain and 
                         suffering in the world than any plan 
                         I ever dreamed of.  Face it, freedom 
                         failed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's why right now is a very groovy 
                         time, man.  We still have freedom, 
                         but we also have responsibility.

                         Well, it seems the tables have turned, 
                         Mr. Powers.

               Just then, Scott Evil enters.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?

               Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It seems the tables have turned again, 
                         Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Not really.  Kill the little bastard.  
                         See what I care.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Man, you are one chilly square!

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Dad, we just made a breakthrough in 
                         group!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I had the group liquidated, you little 
                         shit.  They were insolent.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I 
                         was never artificially created in a 
                         lab.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, don't say that...

               Scott runs off.  In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun 
               out of Alotta's hands.  Alotta pulls out a knife.  Austin 
               SHOOTS the knife out of her hand.  Vanessa grabs Alotta by 
               the throat.

                                     VANESSA
                         This is for sleeping with my man, 
                         you whore!

                                     ALOTTA
                         I didn't sleep with him.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't believe you.

                                     ALOTTA
                              (choking)
                         It's the teeth.

                                     VANESSA
                         OK, I believe you.  But you still 
                         must be chopped.

               Vanessa gives her a judo chop.

                                     VANESSA
                         Judo chop!

               Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which 
               closes and begins to lift up through

               A HOLE IN THE CEILING.  HE RUNS IN.  ON THE WAY, HE FLIPS A 
               SWITCH WHICH SAYS "SELF-DESTRUCT -

               Austin SHOOTS and misses.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the 
               hole in the ceiling.

               They pass Number Two, who is front of an open safe, stuffing 
               his pockets with cash while the others are trying to escape.  
               Austin and Vanessa run to the main chamber...

                         Lay it on me.

                         I love you, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's fab, because I love you, too, 
                         Vanessa.

                         Kiss me.

                         Behave!

               Austin and Vanessa draw towards each other, preparing for a 
               passionate kiss.  Just as their lips are about to touch, 
               however, they are interrupted by a strong WIND and the noise 
               of a HELICOPTER OVERHEAD.  Their hair is blown all about and 
               the waves are whipped into a frenzy.

                         Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. 
                         Evil from destroying the world with 
                         his subterranean nuclear probe, and 
                         somehow you and Agent Kensington 
                         managed to escape unscathed from his 
                         evil lair.

                                     AUSTIN

                         have something for you.

                         a swinging spy from the Sixties, was 
                         unfrozen in the Nineties to battle 
                         his archenemy Dr.  Evil. Austin foiled 
                         Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear 
                         warhead to the center of the earth 
                         and banished him into space forever. 
                         Or so he thought.

               FROM THE FIRST MOVIE: Austin and Vanessa snuggle in bed. She 
               plays with his chest hair.

                                     VANESSA
                         I love you, Mr. Powers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         And I love you, Mrs. Powers.

                         Let's go out on the terrace. It's a 
                         beautiful night, we can look at the 
                         stars.

                         Look how beautiful the night sky is.

                                     VANESSA
                         Isn't that the big dipper?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (sheepish)
                         Well, you know.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hey, I've never seen that big star 
                         before.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, what is that?

               Austin pulls out his telescope and takes a look.

                         This isn't over yet, Mr. Powers. I 
                         have one more trick up my sleeve, 
                         don't I Mr. Bigglesworth?

               The Bob's Big Boy rocket. Suddenly, a hatch opens in Bob's 
               rear end and Dr. Evil's silver egg capsule poops out.

               Capsule begins fiery re-entry to Earth

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               Austin comes in and shuts the balcony door.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh well, I guess it was nothing.

               A VANESSA DOUBLE crosses carrying a bouquet of flowers, which 
               obscure her face.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for some champagne?
                              (pouring)
                         Here's to monotony-- I mean, monogamy!

               Vanessa sits at the vanity with her back turned.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello? Vanessa? What are you doing, 
                         luv?

                                     VANESSA
                              (back turned)
                         Just putting on my--

               As Vanessa turns around she puts her hands up and PULLS OFF 
               HER FACE revealing wires, transistors, and a speaker where 
               her mouth should be.

                                     FEMBOT VANESSA
                              (computer voice)
                         MAKE-UP!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (frightened)
                         Vanessa, you're a Fembot!

               They fight. Midway through the fight, machine guns pop out 
               of Vanessa's breasts.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss 
                         those?

                                     VANESSA
                              (robot voice)
                         PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD TRY 
                         FOREPLAY.

               Her machine gun breasts FIRE, spraying the room in SLO-MO.

               Then they run out of ammo and CLICK, CLICK.

               Austin empties his gun into the robot, but to no avail. She 
               rushes at him, he gives her a judo chop, also to no avail. 
               Then Austin' notices a SELF-DESTRUCT switch and hits it.

               She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she EXPLODES.

               Fembot parts fly around the room. Austin sits on the bed, 
               saddened. He holds Vanessa's hand, which has wires hanging 
               out of it. On one of the fingers is her wedding ring.

               MUSIC: VERY SAD PIANO

                                     AUSTIN
                              (very sad)
                         I can't believe Vanessa, my bride, 
                         my one true love, the woman who taught 
                         me the beauty of sharing your whole 
                         life with another, the person who 
                         taught me the meaning of love, was a 
                         Fembot. How will I ever go on?
                              (beat)
                         Wait a tic! That means I'm single! 
                         Oh, behave!

               INT. LOBBY - HOTEL

               Rich European guests mill about the luxurious lobby. Suddenly, 
               Austin dances through naked. Just as we are about to see his 
               bits and pieces, a man lifts up his suitcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and 
                         free!

               SEQUENCE CREDIT

               MUSIC: Soul Bassanova by QUINCY JONES PAN UP Austin's NAKED 
               body as he walks down a boardwalk. Just as the camera reaches 
               that most sensitive of areas, a credit appears STARRING MIKE 
               MYERS. Austin gives a big 'who me?' and we

               FREEZE FRAME.

               EXT. BOARDWALK - FRENCH RIVERA

               European types stare and point. We see Austin from behind. 
               His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. The bicycle moves 
               away. Just as Austin's bum is about to be revealed-

               A CREDIT APPEARS blocking it. Austin turns his head around 
               to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!' 
               take and we FREEZE FRAME.

               A MAN IN A RAINCOAT flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a 
               credit. Austin just laughs...crazy, man!

               Austin goes around a corner. A moment later he returns, 
               followed by a NUDE MARCHING BAND.

               A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude 
               Beach". Austin enters from the left.

               We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. Just as he 
               is about to appear from behind the sign, a...

               CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis 
               lengthwise as he walks.

               NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE

               A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her 
               bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be 
               suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears.

               The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl. 
               The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit 
               "BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the 
               "PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest.

               Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS 
               appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of 
               nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing 
               CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.

               A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are 
               blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.

               Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out 
               from his waist. Austin looks proud.

               A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier 
               weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND 
               MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.

               Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit 
               "DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits 
               in mid-air:

               FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING" 
               AD.  Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH."

               Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shaguar, baby, yeah!

               CU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar" 
               where it would normally read "Jaguar".

               The car speeds off.

                                     SCOTT
                         I can't believe you'd do this to me 
                         on national television!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         They offered me a free makeover.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the 
                         fathers here today open up to their 
                         sons, sons to the fathers. Is there 
                         anything you'd like to share?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Share?

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Yes, don't you have any secrets?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK. I have a vestigial tail.

               Everyone is a little grossed out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's more of a nub, really. The spine 
                         just goes on a little longer than it 
                         should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, 
                         perform fellatio once and you're a 
                         poet, twice and you're a homosexual. 
                         I remember once I was being fisted 
                         by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where 
                         the story gets interesting. He was 
                         lactose-intolerant. He could eat red 
                         meat all night long, but one sip of 
                         milk and it was gastric hell. And I 
                         remember we were caught in fragrance 
                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you 
                         can imagine my humiliation at having 
                         Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no 
                         teeth." One of my greatest 
                         disappointments is that I never became 
                         a song and dance man. I could have 
                         been a quadruple threat, kind of 
                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, 
                         singer, actor, and I would possess 
                         nuclear weapons, the latter being 
                         the most threatening of the four. I 
                         once sat on a bus and tried to will 
                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended 
                         up with was a sense of failure and a 
                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth 
                         and perhaps a grudging respect for 
                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. 
                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I 
                         slept in a horse once. It was quite 
                         roomy. On second thought, it was the 
                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' 
                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I 
                         wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the 
                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I 
                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy 
                         of The Fonze while I was in coma 
                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer 
                         hash, but who at the end of the day 
                         can honestly say they haven't done 
                         that?

               The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once 
               quiet.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         What are you, some kind of freak?

                                     SCOTT
                         Shut up, jagoff!

               Studio audience whoops at this.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         I'll kick your ass punk!

               Crowd goes crazy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No one talks to my boy that way!

               Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.  
               Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm OK, I'm OK.

               There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking 
               him down.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new 
                         evil lair.

               EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY

               We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the 
               top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and 
               the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.

               INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM

               The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks 
               paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, 
               and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is 
               a Starbucks.

               Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and 
               lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW 
               HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot 
               coffee products.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman 
                         of your organization, I seized upon 
                         the opportunity to invest in a small 
                         Seattle-based coffee company several 
                         years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-
                         flung empire with 2000 outlets 
                         worldwide.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a 
                         good cuppa joe.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         If I may continue, I believe if we 
                         shift our resources away from world 
                         domination and focus on providing 
                         premium quality coffee drinks, we 
                         can increase our gross profits 
                         fivefold.

               Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY 
               MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Perhaps you've confused me 
                         with someone who gives a shit.  Might 
                         I remind you that I run the show 
                         here? I demand a little respect.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (indicating Dr. Evil's 
                              milk mustache)
                         Dr. Evil, I think you--

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Silence! I will not tolerate your 
                         insolence! Remember what happened 
                         last time.

               FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)

               Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit.

               INT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS

               Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         May I add, I appreciate you 
                         reinstating me after our little... 
                         misunderstanding.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?

               We see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before.

                                     FRAU
                         Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How are things?

                                     FRAU
                         I have come to embrace the love that 
                         dare not speak it's name. To my right 
                         is my lover.

               We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous 
               eyebrow.

                                     FRAU
                         Her name is Unibrau. I met her on 
                         the LPGA Tour.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.

               Dr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy 
               milk mustache even larger.

                                     FRAU
                         Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (wiping it off, 
                              embarrassed)
                         Oh, I know. I know.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the 
                         Greek assassin, Oedipus.

               We see a swarthy Greek army guy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. 
                         Excited?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         I could give a shit.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Kiss your mother with that mouth?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         Yes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course you do.

               Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his 
               control panel, but Number Two interrupts.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing throat)
                         Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at 
                         which you liquidate henchmen far 
                         exceeds our ability to replace them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have so few pleasures left to me, 
                         Number Two. The key to life is to 
                         rotate your vices. One day it's 
                         executions, another day it's creamy 
                         French cheese.  It's like frickin' 
                         heroin.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the 
                         answer. While you were frozen, we 
                         began a program to clone you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Cool.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         We had a few glitches, but I think 
                         you'll be pleased with the results.

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Send in the clone!

               MUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching 
               figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and 
               scarier.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         He is identical to you in every way, 
                         except he is one-eighth your size.

               We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL, 
               just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. 
               Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding 
               his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini-
                         Me.
                              (to clone)
                         Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.

               Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command 
               chair.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Mr. Bigglesworth!

               The bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's 
               lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's 
               lap.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-me, something to eat?
                              (expectant pause)
                         No?
                              (pause)
                         OK.
                              (to room)
                         Tired.  Gentleman, I have a plan. As 
                         you know, the most powerful man in 
                         the world is the President of the 
                         United States. But he is just that- 
                         a man, subject to temptations of the 
                         flesh like any other man. Here's 
                         what we do: we make it seem that the 
                         President has had "extra-marital 
                         oral relations" with- and this is 
                         the kicker-

               DRAMATIC STING, SNAP ZOOM TO DR. EVIL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         With a White House intern!

               Dr. Evil gloats. So does Mini-Me.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing his throat)
                         Uh-hem.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What, that already happened?

               Number Two nods.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, 
                         how about a frickin' time machine? 
                         Does the president have a time 
                         machine? Have I been scooped on that?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         No, not that I'm aware of.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, time machine it is. As you 
                         know, every diabolical scheme I've 
                         hatched has been thwarted by Austin 
                         Powers. And why is that, ladies and 
                         gentlemen?

                                     SCOTT
                         Because you never kill him when you 
                         get the chance and you're a dope?

               Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott 
               Evil" button on Dr. Evil's control panel.

               Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle. Mini-Me glares at Scott 
               and GIVES HIM THE FINGER.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, because Austin Powers has "mojo".

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Mojo?

                                     FRAU
                         Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, 
                         the essence, the libido, the "right 
                         stuff".

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's what the French call a certain 
                         'I don't know what.'

                                     SCOTT
                         If you've got a time machine, why 
                         don't you just go back and kill Austin 
                         Powers when he's a baby or something?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, no, no.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (interrupting)
                         Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to 
                         use your knowledge of the future to 
                         play the stock market? We could 
                         literally make trillions.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (smug laugh to himself)
                         Why make trillions when we could 
                         make...
                              (pause)
                         Billions?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Excuse me?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Why think small is all I'm saying.

                                     SCOTT
                         A trillion is more than a billion, 
                         numb-nuts.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Zip it. Unveil the time portal!

               A wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of 
               shimmering energy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the 
                         time portal. As you know, Austin 
                         Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, 
                         I time travel to 1969, two years 
                         after he was frozen. Security will 
                         be lax and I'll strike when he is 
                         totally helpless.

               First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination 
               of the world.

                                     SCOTT
                         Can I come?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, Scott, Daddy has a score to 
                         settle. Austin Powers is the snake 
                         to my mongoose, or the mongoose to 
                         my snake. Either way it's bad, I 
                         don't know animals. But I do know 
                         this: This time it's personal. Frau, 
                         Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969. 
                         Come, Mini-Me.

               Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him 
               perfectly. They enter the portal.

               There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in 
               Star Trek.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR -

               Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal 
               into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room 
               dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A 
               younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in 
               an eye-patch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number 
                         Two, you look very youthful and 
                         healthy.
                              (turning to Frau)
                         And Frau you look...right.

               As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise 
               from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets 
               caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is 
               frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK, people, we now officially have a 
                         chair problem. If another one of 
                         these chairs hits me in the nuts, 
                         I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want 
                         you to meet Number Two.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hello there.

               Mini-me says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me?

               Mini-me still says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shy. Low blood sugar.
                              (to room)
                         Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I 
                         have an operative inside the Ministry 
                         of Defense. By this time tomorrow, 
                         Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.

               Dr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (maniacal laugh)
                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND -

               We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of 
               a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the 
               side of a volcano on a tropical island.

                                     DR. EVIL (V.O.)
                              (maniacal laugh)
                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               INT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM -

               We see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it, 
               we see two digital clocks. One reads:

               CURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN: 
               NOVEMBER 11, 1967. One of the SCOTS GUARDS, is an IMMENSELY 
               FAT SCOTTISH SOLDIER (played by Mike Myers).

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         We've had reports that there's a spy 
                         in the Ministry of Defense.  The 
                         contents of this room are vital to 
                         the country. Be on special alert.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                              (thick Scottish accent)
                         Those bastards will have to kill me 
                         before I let anything happen to this 
                         wee naked hairy popsicle, sir!

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         Very good. And try and lose some 
                         weight for God's sake!

               They exchange salutes and the Colonel exits.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                         Yessir!
                              (sotto after the 
                              Colonel)
                         I outta smash your teeth out with a 
                         Toffee Hammer Mr. English Colonel 
                         Telling-Me-What-To-Do-And-Stealing-
                         our-Oil-Refusing-To-Recognize- our-
                         Scottish-Independence!

               The Fat Soldier begins to play the BAGPIPES, a white vapor 
               comes out of them, filling the room.

               The other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious.

               He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech 
               syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places 
               it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green, 
               indicating FULL MOJO.

               EXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY

               Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS 
               COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly 
               Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge 
               reads empty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's 
                         funny, I just filled the Shaguar up 
                         this morning.

               Austin hits a button on the dashboard.

               BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of 
                         British Intelligence.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You always are, Basil. Listen, the 
                         weirdest thing just happened, I've 
                         run out of petrol.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         We'll send a man around immediately. 
                         How was your honeymoon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She 
                         was a Fembot!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Ah women, who can understand them? 
                         Moving on, let's discuss your new 
                         case.

                                     AUSTIN
                         New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         You'll be doing a photo shoot. We 
                         know that one of the models is an ex-
                         KGB agent selling top secret material 
                         to the highest bidder.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That sounds easy enough, you know 
                         what they say: all work and no 
                         shagging makes Austin a dull boy, 
                         man!

               INT. SKI LODGE

               Austin sets up his photo equipment. The room is decorated in 
               classic Heffner- bear skin rugs, leather chairs, roaring 
               fire.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Tres chic, baby.

               REG, the photo assistant, enters.

                                     REG
                         Austin, the models are ready.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ta, Reg. Bless your cotton socks. 
                         Hey, Reg, do you have any hobbies?

                                     REG
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hobbies, man! I for one enjoy making 
                         models!

               The models make their entrance. They are REAL SUPERMODELS, 
               say CINDY CRAWFORD, REBECCA ROMAJIN and also one MODEL we 
               don't know.

                         It's him! Oh my God! It's Austin 
                         Powers!

               Austin shoots a look to Reg like 'still got it, baby.'

                                     AUSTIN
                         One at a time, girls. One. At. A. 
                         Time!

                                     CINDY
                         Hi, I'm Cindy. I don't believe I've 
                         had the pleasure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course you haven't had "The 
                         Pleasure", we just met, baby, yeah!

                                     REBECCA
                         How do you do, Austin? I'm Rebecca.
                              (indicating the photo 
                              gear)
                         Your equipment is quite impressive.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you. Your breasts are amazing.

               Austin comes to the unknown model. She is tall and angular.

                                     AUSTIN
                         And what's your name, baby?

                         Excuse me?

                         Ivana. Ivana Humpalot.

                         And I vanna toilet made of solid 
                         gold but it's just not in the cards, 
                         now is it?

               Austin looks over the girls, trying to decide who is the 
               spy.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                              (inner monologue)
                         Now, which one is the Russian spy? 
                         Cindy Crawford, Rebecca Romajin... 
                         or Ivana Humpalot? Think, man, think!

               Austin begins snapping pictures. The sequence is shot like a 
               photo shoot, with freeze frames, etc.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, baby! Love it. Turn and 
                         pout for me baby! Smashing!

               Cindy gets on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great, darling. Give me some shoulder. 
                         Yes, yes, yes.
                              (angry)

                         Show me love. Smashing! You're an 
                         animal. You're a tiger. Be a tiger, 
                         baby! You're great! You're Grrrrrr-
                         eat! You're Tony, be corn flakes, 
                         baby, be frosted. Now be a lemur, 
                         baby! You're a ring-tailed lemur.

               Rebecca looks confused.

                         this!
                              (imitating lemur)
                         OK, predator coming! Now, burrow, 
                         burrow! You're a lemur. It's all 
                         you've got.
                              (beat)
                         I take it back. Be a tiger again.

                         And... done! I'm spent!

               Austin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it.

                                     REG
                         Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot 
                         and I are going to have a 'private 
                         session'.

               Reg shows the girls out as they PROTEST. Austin and Ivana 
               are left alone. Austin CLAPS TWICE and the lights dim. He 
               CLAPS again and the fire goes up.

                         When did you get "The Clapper"?

                                     AUSTIN
                         November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, 
                         shore leave.

                                     IVANA
                         Are you cold, Mr. Powers?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I once had a bad experience with 
                         frostbite. I had to dip my tadger 
                         into a brandy snifter.

               Ivana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby.

                                     IVANA
                         Do you know how we keep warm in 
                         Russia?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can guess, baby.

                                     IVANA
                         We play chess.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I guessed wrong.

                                     IVANA
                         It takes a keen intelligence to play 
                         chess. Of course, you know what they 
                         say about men with big brains, don't 
                         you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         They wear large hats?

                                     IVANA
                         No, they make better lovers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wrong again.

               Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in 
               The Thomas Crowne Affair).

                                     IVANA
                         I assume you know how to play.

               She runs the bishop across her lips sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course.  The... horsey... moves 
                         in an L shape.

               Austin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let's stop playing games with each 
                         other... especially difficult ones. 
                         May I ask you a question, Miss 
                         Humpalot?

                                     IVANA
                         Of course.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny? Do I?

               Austin rolls around on the polar bear rug.

                                     IVANA
                         I'll tell you anything you want to 
                         know, just make love to me.

               She pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair.

                                     IVANA
                         You are hairy, like an animal!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (growling and barking)
                         Grrrr, baby.

               Austin takes the head of the bear skin rug.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf!
                              (covers the bear's 
                              eyes)
                         Wait a tick, I don't want him watching 
                         me while I'm on the job!

                                     IVANA
                         Make love to me, monkey man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy, baby!

               We pan around the room, seeing all the stuffed and mounted 
               wildlife who seem to be watching. Suddenly the camera stops. 
               So does the music.

                                     IVANA (O.S.)
                         What's the matter?

                         Austin, I came as soon as I heard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         There must be some kind of mistake, 
                         Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't 
                         know it.

               Austin holds his neck very stiffly.

                         an article in that Playboy, but a 
                         candy-stripe nurse offering to give 
                         you a sponge bath didn't so much as 
                         turn your head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait, I can explain, man! I was going 
                         to shag her but the article was so 
                         fascinating--

               Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY.

                         it's time to retire.

               largest room you've ever seen in your life.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         We have evidence that Dr. Evil has 
                         developed a time machine.

               Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous 
               villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Our researcher noticed that these 
                         photos from the archives have changed. 
                         That means Dr. Evil is traveling 
                         back in time and creating alliances 
                         with each decade's most despised 
                         villains.

               Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't read in the car. I get a bit 
                         vomy.

               Austin burps and swallows it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Got it. I almost gipped.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.)
                         Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is 
                         in the year 1969. Luckily, we also 
                         have a time travel device. After 
                         years of research we've developed a 
                         machine that will transport you back 
                         to the Sixties.

               A bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new 
               VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by 
               Peter Max.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But Basil, isn't that the new 
                         Volkswagen Beetle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         That's what they'd like you to 
                         believe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 
                         and I was frozen in 1967, I could go 
                         look at my frozen self. But, if I'm 
                         still frozen in 1967, how could I 
                         have been unthawed in the 90's and 
                         traveled back to the Sixties?
                              (goes cross-eyed)
                         Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (to camera)
                         I suggest you don't worry about those 
                         things and just enjoy yourself.

               Austin gets into the car and turns it on.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This is smashing Basil. I'll go back 
                         to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, 
                         defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time 
                         for tea.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Good luck, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.

               Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and 
               smashes some equipment.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.
                              (changing gears)
                         Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, 
                         yeah!

               The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, 
               leaving flaming tread marks.

               FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - LONDON -

               The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches 
               to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws 
               the hukka down. Austin hops out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I feel better already, man!

               Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being 
               TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.

               EXT. PARK - LONDON

               Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see 
               that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big 
               ARYAN ASSASSIN.

               PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 
               watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who 
               she is.

               A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of 
               all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. 
               The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!

               Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of 
               the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage 
               and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: 
               "SEXUAL REVOLUTION."

               Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number 
               begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet 
               Charity or Hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU 
                         CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE 
                         SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY 
                         JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

               Hip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES 
                         US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER
                         THAN THE SWORD

               Austin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM 
               SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU 
                         AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING 
                         IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET

               Forty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH.  
                         WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'

               Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines 
               for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman 
               are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we 
               see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE 
               SYMBOL MEDALLION.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE--
                         SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE
                         OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!

               Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms 
               outstretched.

               The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera.

                                     EVERYONE
                              (chanting)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (louder)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (louder)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (shouting)
                         IT'S THE SIXTIES!

               The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with 
               their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily 
               and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

               We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is 
               the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES 
               behind the binoculars hiding her face.

               37 EXT. CARNABY ST.

               Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.

               Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

               The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.

               The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.

               The business man nods to a BOBBY.

               The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.

               The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.

               The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.

               The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.

               The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.

               The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

               The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.

               The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR 
               on a double-decker bus.

               The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

               The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.

               INT. CITROEN

               The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole 
               nodding sequence was a circular waste of time.

               EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES

               Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at 
               him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds 
               a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a 
               wall by hugging himself.

               The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his 
               gun.

               Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.

               It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps 
               out.

               We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a 
               sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing 
               suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol 
               medallion.

               She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

               MUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME

                                     FELICITY
                         Care for a ride?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my Beetle, baby.

                                     FELICITY
                         It was your Beetle. Get in.

               Austin dives in as the assassin FIRES. The car speeds off.

               INT. BEETLE (REAR PROJECTION)

               Felicity drives expertly.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin Powers, I presume?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Powers by name, Powers by reputation.

                                     FELICITY
                         Felicity Shagwell, CIA. Shagwell by 
                         name, Shag-very-Well by reputation.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (turning to camera)
                         Crazy, baby!

               EXT. ROAD

               The Beetle zips along, and then-- the Citroen appears behind 
               it.

               The assassin FIRES.

               INT. BEETLE

               Felicity turns around to look.

                                     FELICITY
                         Grab the wheel, would you?

               Austin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun. She turns 
               and FIRES out the window.

               EXT. ROAD

               The assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and 
               he jumps out as it goes over.

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three 
               times before it EXPLODES.

               EXT. CLIFF

               The assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand. He falls.

                                     ASSASSIN
                         Ahhhhhhhh!

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and 
               tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too, 
               EXPLODES.

                                     FELICITY
                         Well, Austin, I think this time you 
                         may have met your match.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and 
                         I'll beat him again.

                                     FELICITY
                         I was talking about me.

               She smiles, turns, and walks away.

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD

               The room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing 
               illumination. Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an 
               elevator into the middle of the spotlight.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Welcome to my shag pad, baby.

               Light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi-
               fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin.

               Austin blows DUST off a table.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for something to drink?

               Austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a 
               wetbar.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Or perhaps something to read?

               Austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a 
               button. It revolves to reveal a bookcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How about a hot cup of coffee?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, I rather fancy a grind.

                         Oh, Behave!

               Austin hits a button and an automatic coffee-pourer pours a 
               cup.

                         Would you like a... mas-sage? A 
                         sensssual mas-sage?

               Austin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the 
               floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into 
               place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a 
               reel-to-reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of 
               massage oils.

               Felicity lies on her stomach. Austin begins to massage her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How does that feel, baby?

                                     FELICITY
                         Mmm, lower.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (lowering his voice)
                         HOW DOES THAT FEEL, BABY?

               They laugh. Austin continues to massage her.

                                     FELICITY
                         Wait, something's itching me.

               She reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening 
               dress, revealing her naked back.

                                     FELICITY
                         That's better.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crikey!!!

               Austin GULPS and accidentally spurts way too much oil on 
               her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.

               Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (talking to his crotch)
                         Hello, anyone home? C'mon lads, do 
                         it for England.

               Austin takes a peak-- nothing. He is panicked.

                                     FELICITY
                         Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity 
                         stretches very sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you 'like to see my etchings?

                              (sexy)
                         I think I'm ready for bed.

               She moves close to Austin. He slides to the other side of 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get you some PJs.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I'm ready for bed.

               She moves over to him. He avoids her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth 
                         then.

               Austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. Felicity finally 
               grabs him and pins him to the bed.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I want to have sex with you, 
                         Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello Vicar!

                                     FELICITY
                         I've studied everything about you- 
                         your methods, your accomplishments, 
                         your preferences. You're the reason 
                         I became a spy. Now, I've waited two 
                         years to meet you, so I say we get 
                         busy making up for lost time.

               Austin sits up.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (reflective)
                         Felicity, I used to think that way, 
                         too, but I guess... I guess I've 
                         changed.  Not to make a short story 
                         long, or to ramble on and on, or to 
                         keep talking in a repetitive manner 
                         ad infinitum until it becomes 
                         impossible to remember what I was 
                         talking about in the first place, 
                         but- where was I?

                         I've lost my mojo.

                         I thought coming back to the Sixties 
                         would bring it back, but it hasn't.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, don't worry. I know just the 
                         man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo 
                         recommended him and he's the best.

                         Powers.

                         Good on ya. I don't know what that 
                         means but it sounds fab.

                         Hold your horses and any other beasts-
                         of burden. I must lead my disciples 
                         in meditation and then I will help 
                         you.

               The Guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples 
               sink to their knees.

                                     DISCIPLES

                                     GURU PITKA
                         My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a 
                         spiritual teacher and I have combined 
                         many disparate disciplines into a 
                         unified movement of human potentiality 
                         and equipoise that I learned from my 
                         guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste 
                         man who died mysteriously of a disease 
                         that strangely had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis. He would say to me, 
                         Sparky, love is all, life is breath.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhh!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, perhaps you are wondering where 
                         I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, 
                         when we were young we used to play a 
                         game called "Stinkmop". We would 
                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop 
                         into it, and play tag. I did not 
                         care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise 
                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, 
                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name 
                         kind of stuck.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, the reason I am a spiritualist 
                         instead of a therapist is that 
                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' 
                         and that will not help us attain 
                         potentiality. Now what is 
                         potentiality? It is the ability to 
                         achieve those goals that we wish to 
                         achieve for ourselves. People often 
                         say to me that they feel "nowhere", 
                         and I am going to change that to 
                         "Now here."

               The guru holds up a card which says "NOWHERE = NOW HERE!"

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         And you have many assumptions about 
                         your goals, but when you "assume" 
                         You make an "ass" out of "u" and 
                         "me".

               Guru holds up a card which says "ASSUME = ASS - U - ME."

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh....

                                     GURU PITKA
                         The being, or that which we call 
                         'ourselves', is not the tinker.  It 
                         is not the taughts. It is the Gap 
                         between the tinker and the taughts! 
                         We are not our mind, we are not our 
                         body, we are the Gap!

               Guru holds up a card that says "NOT TINKER, NOT TAUGHTS, BUT 
               THE GAP" with the familiar Gap font.

                              (rapid fire)
                         The heart of the matter is that you 
                         are the heart of the matter.  There 
                         is no "I" in "team". Beer before 
                         liquor, never sicker. Don't take a 
                         wooden nickel.  If your pipe is short 
                         and your pump is weak, you better 
                         stand close or you'll piss on your 
                         feet. He who goes to bed with itchy 
                         bum wakes up with smelly finger.

                         Finally, the path to spiritual 
                         awakening requires the death of ego. 
                         Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the 
                         mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay 
                         Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

                         My flag's at half mast and no one 
                         will salute it.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Sorry?

                                     AUSTIN
                         My Willie don't work.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Why are you beating around the bush?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my problem.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Ohhhhh, I get it.
                              (beat)
                         No, I don't get it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, easy.
                              (to Guru)
                         Felicity and I were all set for some 
                         hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for 
                         six.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Oh, yes, I see.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You have no idea what I'm saying, do 
                         you?

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Not a word.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Guru, I've lost my mojo.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Oh, mojo! You should have said so. 
                         Well, you've lost your mojo because 
                         your chakras are misaligned. You 
                         have lost love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?

                                     FELICITY
                         Who's Vanessa?

                                     AUSTIN
                         She was an evil robot minion of Dr. 
                         Evil. I couldn't have loved her.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, 
                         buddy. You will only get your mojo 
                         back when you surround yourself with 
                         love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get what you're saying now! 
                         He's talking about free love, baby! 
                         Tune in, turn on, and drop out!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         I am talking about true love. You 
                         must stay and study until you are 
                         worthy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No way, man. The only way to surround 
                         yourself with love is to throw a 
                         swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!

               INT. DR.EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

               Dr. Evil and Frau are interrupted by the man we now know as 
               FAT BASTARD. He is foul-mouthed, and when he swears he is 
               bleeped.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have 
                         the mojo?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         First things first, where's your 
                         shitter? I've gotta bleepin, turtle 
                         head pokin' out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (disgusted)
                         Right. Charming. Fat Bastard- you 
                         don't mind me calling you Fat Bastard 
                         do you?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I've got a lot of demons kickin' 
                         around in my noggin, but weight issues 
                         ain't one of them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, Fatty-

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the 
                         incorrect weight for my height and I 
                         was born out of wedlock, hence the 
                         moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not 
                         kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck 
                         that could choke a donkey.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, the mojo?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Where's my (bleeping) money?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         A gentlemen never discusses money.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Fine, you can take your (bleep)in' 
                         money and shove it up your (bleep), 
                         you stupid (bleeping) prick! While 
                         you're at it you can suck my greasy, 
                         two-toned (bleep)!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pause)
                         Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         (Bleep) you!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Bring in the money.

               Dr. Evil PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS drive in a forklift loaded 
               with gold bars.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, here it is.

               Fat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of 
               MOJO.

               Dr. Evil is mesmerized.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, fetch.

               Mini-Me runs and snatches the mojo from Fat Bastard and gives 
               it to Dr. Evil, who caresses it and places it on a SPECIALLY 
               PREPARED PEDESTAL.

               NUMBER TWO enters.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I have some bad news. Austin 
                         Powers is back in the Sixties. One 
                         of our best assassins spotted him 
                         but he got away.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have 
                         his mojo.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         There is another. Felicity Shagwell, 
                         CIA.

               Suddenly, Scott Evil enters through TIME PORTAL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, what are you doing here?

                                     SCOTT
                         I don't know, I was sitting around 
                         watching the tube and The Courtship 
                         of Eddie's Father came on Nick at 
                         Nite, you know, and I was just 
                         listening to that theme song--
                              (hums/sings the theme)
                         Anyway it made me think that maybe 
                         we could try and work things out. 
                         You know, you are my Dad and I need 
                         you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You had your chance, Scott. I already 
                         have someone created in my image. 
                         He's evil, he wants to take over the 
                         world, and he fits easily into most 
                         overhead storage bins.
                              (looking around)
                         Has anyone seen Mini-Me?
                              (calling out)
                         Mini-Me! Mini-Mouse? Mini-Driver? 
                         Hello! Mini Pearl? Can we put a 
                         frickin' bell on him or something?

               Scott, very hurt, sits back in his chair and sulks. Dr. Evil 
               hits a button and a model moon and a model earth descend.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, phase three. We place a 
                         giant laser on the moon. Let me 
                         demonstrate.
                              (beat)
                         Where's my laser?

               Dr. Evil looks around and sees Mini-Me gnawing on the model 
               laser. Dr. Evil takes it from his mouth

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, don't chew my laser.
                              (to room)
                         Not feeling well. He has an ear 
                         infection, but tit's OK.
                              (pause)
                         No? Nothing?
                              (back to model)
                         Anyway, the laser is powerful enough 
                         to destroy every city on the planet 
                         at will. We'll turn the moon into 
                         what I like to call a "Death Star".

               Scott SNICKERS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What?

                                     SCOTT
                              (snickering again)
                         Nothing Darth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What did you call me?

                                     SCOTT
                         Nothing.
                              (pretends to sneeze)
                         Rip-off!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unsure)
                         Bless you? Anyways, since my "death 
                         star" laser was invented by the noted 
                         Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I 
                         thought we'd name it in his honor-- 
                         the Alan Parsons Project.

               Scott SNICKERS again.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What now?

                                     SCOTT
                         The Alan Parsons Project was a 
                         progressive rock band from 1982.  
                         Why don't you just name it Operation 
                         Wang Chung, ass?

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (indicating laser)
                         When you get your own evil empire, 
                         you can call it whatever you want.  
                         Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate 
                         the awesome lethality of the Alan 
                         Parsons Project. Fire the laser!

               INSERT SHOT:

               A giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the White 
               House, causing it to explode.

               Everyone is shocked by the laser's power.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My God, Dr. Evil, you destroyed the 
                         Wihite House with no warning!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, that was just footage from 
                         the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture 
                         Independence Day, but it would be a 
                         lot like that. What do you think, 
                         Scott?

                                     SCOTT
                         Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was 
                         really impressive.

                         Shhhh!

                         I'm nineteen, I don't-

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shh! Shh-Shh. Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh. Shh-
                         shh! It's Morse code.
                              (reading imaginary 
                              paper)
                         Let me decipher... it says 'shhhhh!'

                         You are so lame-

                              (like Electric Company)
                         Ssssss...huuuuuh...Shhhhh!

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, what are we going to do 
                         about Powers?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, in addition to being 
                         extremely rotund, you're a vicious 
                         killer.

               Take care of it.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It'll be my pleasure.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's an easy job. Without his mojo, 
                         Powers will be...powerless?

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

               A party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in 
               full swing. A girl dances in an oversized birdcage.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, 
                         baby, yeah!

               The party sequence is shot like Laugh-In. Very fast cuts to 
               the music.

               Austin sees a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN drinking a martini and 
               smoking.  He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from 
               her.

                                     PREGNANT WOMAN
                         Hey!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You'll thank me later, baby.

               Another angle. Austin and Felicity dancing.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (noticing someone)
                         Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?

               We see RICARDO MONTEBLAN -smoking a hukka on a round chair.

                                     RICARDO
                         Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen 
                         and the king laughed because he had 
                         too.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to camera)
                         Crazy, man!

                                     FELICITY
                         Let's split up and scope the scene.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at 
                         least not without me.

               Felicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to chick)
                         You're very exotic, baby. Do you 
                         have a little English in you?

                                     CHICK
                         No.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you like to?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An Alan Zeus-type very gay guy.

                              (rolling his eyes)
                         This is ridiculous!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A LONDON COP and Felicity are on hanging chairs.

                                     LONDON COP
                         Have you ever been picked up by the 
                         fuzz?

                                     FELICITY
                         No, but I bet it really hurts.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GUY IN A RAINCOAT on a tricycle, shot undercranked, rides 
               through the party and falls over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin pops into frame with a book that says "AUSTIN POWERS 
               SEXY DICTIONARY".

                                     AUSTIN
                         The Austin Powers Sexy Dictionary 
                         defines an Eskimo hooker as a frosty 
                         prosty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I don't get it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The camera pans up Felicity's cool hip-huggers, which are 
               very tight.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Those are skin tight. How do you get 
                         into those pants, baby?

                                     FELICITY
                         Well you can start by buying me a 
                         drink.

               Austin does a spit take.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin is wearing a silly spiked German helmet like in Hogan's 
               Heroes.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (German accent)
                         Hello, I am Baron Von Firstinbed. 
                         Last night I had German-Chinese food. 
                         An hour later I was hungry- for power.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         handful of F-off pills?

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         who was engaged to be married?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yeah, I heard she broke it off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Film running backwards of Austin doing a spit take.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Verrrrry interesting- but shtupid!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin takes his glasses off to clean them. We see his POV, 
               which is totally fuzzy. He looks over and sees what appears 
               to be a NUDE GIRL- two round globes and dark triangle.

               Austin puts his glasses on and looks again. It is actually a 
               girl in a flesh-colored dress. In between her and Austin 
               were two COMPLETELY BALD MEN and a triangular martini glass 
               filled with a Cosmopolitan.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Cut to Austin and Felicity together again.

                         Look at that.

               She points to where Fat Bastard and his companion are 
               standing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not a pretty sight. Who is 
                         he?

                                     FELICITY
                         Until recently he worked security 
                         for the MOD, but we think he might 
                         be a double agent, possibly for Dr. 
                         Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How do you know?

                                     FELICITY
                         We've noticed that his lifestyle has 
                         changed dramatically. He's made a 
                         lot of cash purchases, he's hanging 
                         out with foxes half his age, and 
                         he's becomes quite a fixture on the 
                         London party circuit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who's the girl?

                                     FELICITY
                         I don't know, but it looks like he's 
                         splitting.

               Fat Bastard exits.

                                     FELICITY
                         I'll follow him. You see what you 
                         can get out of the girl. We'll 
                         rendezvous later.

               Felicity follows Fat Bastard out the door. Austin makes his 
               way over to the girl.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, hello.

                         Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who are you today, baby?

                                     GIRL
                         Robin. Robin Swallows.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Swallows? That's an interesting name. 
                         Are you English?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         German, actually. My maiden name is 
                         Spitz.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well which is it, baby, Spitz or 
                         Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         The pleasure is mine.

               She extends her hand. Austin takes it and shakes. As he 
               shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello. Austin is 
               transfixed and keeps shaking far too long.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Charmed, I'm sure.
                              (still shaking, her 
                              breasts jiggle)
                         How do you do?
                              (still shaking, 
                              jiggling)
                         Yes, quite.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I always enjoy meeting new people.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         How's your mum? Good.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I love shaking hands.

               Austin. is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in 
               danger of popping out of her dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (snapping out of it)
                         So, who was your friend?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         His name is Fat Bastard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It suits him.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         He's my lover.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         OK. Would you happen to know if he's 
                         in business with a man named Mr. 
                         Evil?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin 
                         does a smug take.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Something to drink? Would you like a 
                         Mister Pepper?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really? I said Mister Pepper.

               Austin does another smug take. Robin grabs Austin and pulls 
               him close.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         You're a groovy boy, I'd like to 
                         strap you on sometime.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               EXT. FISH AND CHIPS STAND - NIGHT

               Literally a window in a wall. Fat Bastard is placing his 
               order.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         ...and I'll have a fried-prawn 
                         sandwich, with extra mayonnaise, two 
                         whole chickens, a kidney pie, a toad 
                         in the hole, bubble and squeak, 
                         bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish 
                         and chips, and... a Fresca. No ice.

               We pan to see Felicity beside him.

                                     FELICITY
                         I love a man with a large appetite.

                         (bleep)ing.

               Felicity swallows hard and forces a smile.

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

                                     AUSTIN
                         Can I ask you a question?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you.

               Beat.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Well, what's the question?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes. Would you like to shag? 
                         Would you?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I'd love to, Mr. Powers, just come 
                         right... over... here.

               Robin moves Austin into place as they dance.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're a bit of alright.

               Just then, Austin looks into her eyes and sees the REFLECTION 
               OF AN ASSASSIN (Oedipus) about to throw a knife.

               Just as he throws it, Austin spins Robin Swallows around and 
               USES HER AS A SHIELD. She takes the knife squarely in the 
               back.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                              (strained)
                         Oedipus... use the revolver.

               Oedipus pulls out a pistol and begins FIRING. Austin continues 
               to use Robin AS A SHIELD. She takes six hits. Oedipus runs 
               out of bullets.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                              (strained)
                         Oedipus... use the machine gun.

               Oedipus pulls out a machine gun and FIRES. In a Robert 
               Rodriquez- like flurry of events, Austin dodges while still 
               USING HER AS A SHIELD.

               Oedipus throws down his gun and charges Austin. Austin uses 
               Robin's body to block Oedipus's head butt, but his momentum 
               pushes all three of them through a PLATE GLASS WINDOW of his 
               second story loft.

               IN MID-AIR

               As they fall, Austin turns Robin around so that she is between 
               him and the ground.

               EXT. OUTSIDE AUSTINIS FLAT

               They land with a THUD. Robin cushions Austin's fall. Oedipus 
               is dead on the pavement.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead 
                         as vaudeville.

                         You can't win, Powers. Dr. Evil has 
                         your mojo and it's only a matter of 
                         time before he kills you and takes 
                         over the world.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Felicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a 
               cigarette.  We hear strange sounds offstage.

               We pan over to reveal she's IN BED WITH A NAKED FAT BASTARD!

               He is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I always get (bleep)in' hungry after 
                         I get my end away!

                                     FELICITY
                         I never would have thought that a 
                         man of such tremendous girth could 
                         be such a, um, creative and sensuous 
                         lover!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         You want some chicken? I have more!

               He rolls over to reveal his HUGE NAKED ASS.

               Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around 
               for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage 
               and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to 
               go.

               ANGLE on FAT BASTARD'S face. He is delighted.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Frisky are we? Alright lets have 
                         another go!

               She is horrified.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

               Dr. Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two.

                         Not what I want Mr. President, but I 
                         will receive. In 12 hours I will 
                         destroy Washington, DC with a giant 
                         laser.

               Dr. Evil reveals a giant laser. Mini-Me is humping it like a 
               dog.

                         laser get a frickin' room. Honestly.
                              (to President)
                         I will destroy another major city

                         I don't think l00 billion is even a 
                         number. It's like saying I want a

               Dr. Evil looks around smugly. No one laughs.

               Dr. Evil signs off.

                         I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding 
                         Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech, 
                         very touching.

               Scott looks at him with disgust.

                                     DR.EVIL
                         Okay, everybody clear the room!

               Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his 
               logo. He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal... A 
               SECRET SHRINE TO AUSTIN POWERS!

               In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and 
               various magazine covers.

               He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the 
               ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head. A backless mockup 
               of Austin's suit rises from the floor. He puts on a pair of 
               glasses. He has become Austin Powers.

               Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic.

                         This isn't working. I don't feel 
                         anything.

               We PUSH IN towards Dr. Evil's head.

               sprout the word "EVIL'.

               A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses 
               smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE" 
               and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".

               Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth 
               coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have 
               the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE" 
               flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns 
               into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
               stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of 
               urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred 
               Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says 
               "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream 
               that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

               FLASH CUT BACK TO:

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - AUSTIN SHRINE

               Pull back from Dr. Evil's head. He looks dazed and confused. 
               Just then, Number Two re-enters the room, catching Dr. Evil 
               with all his Austin paraphernalia.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, one last thing. I-- oh.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I was just... right. Would it kill 
                         you to frickin' knock?

               EXT./INT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin and Felicity walk along the street.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, tell me about the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You know I can't tell you details 
                         about the future, baby, it could 
                         alter history.

                                     FELICITY
                         Not details, just what it's like. 
                         You know, what's the scene?  Where's 
                         it at?

                                     AUSTIN
                         There've been a lot of advances in 
                         the Nineties, baby. The economy is 
                         stable, people take better care of 
                         their health concern for the 
                         environment is on the rise and, um, 
                         let's see, there's an entire 
                         television channel dedicated to golf.

                                     FELICITY
                         Sounds awful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's not so bad once you get used to 
                         it. The Nineties are about 
                         responsibility. You know, having 
                         respect for yourself and other people. 
                         I even got married.

                                     FELICITY
                         You? Married? What about the sexual 
                         revolution?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, it turns out there were some 
                         casualties, baby. Don't you think 
                         you'll ever get married?

                                     FELICITY
                         No, not until I get a little more 
                         'experience' under my belt.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand 
               to his mouth in fear.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wide-eyed)
                         Oh my God!

               Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun.

                                     FELICITY
                              (looking around)
                         What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, written here on my hand, see?

               Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh 
               my God' on his hand with the pen.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Says 'Oh my God!'

               They laugh.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, look.

               Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an 
               instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS.

               They run down the street filming each other.

               AUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE

               This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film 
               from Austin and Felicity's POVs.

               There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of 
               frame like the MONKEES TV show.

               BACK ON THE STREET

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I haven't had this much 
                         fun since I worked undercover in 
                         Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.

                                     FELICITY
                         1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch 
                         cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from 
                         poisoning the world's water supply.

               Austin is impressed.

                                     FELICITY
                         I've studied your file, Austin. I 
                         want to be a trailblazer, just like 
                         you.  The Seventies are right around 
                         the corner. It's going to be a 
                         glorious time for fashion and music 
                         and technology-- it won't be long 
                         before every flying car has its own 
                         8-track.

               Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue.

                                     FELICITY
                         The CIA has always been a boy's club 
                         until now. Well move over, this 
                         chick's taking over.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Very impressive.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, your voice!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I think I'm coming down with 
                         something.

               Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his 
               pushcart.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get some ice cream. Would you 
                         like some?

                                     FELICITY
                         No thanks.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse, to ice cream 
                              man)
                         Could I have two scoops of Vanilla, 
                         please?

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Right away, governor. Would you like 
                         chocolate syrup?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes, please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Will you have any whipped cream?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         I will, thank you.

                                     ICE CR@ MAN
                         Candy sprinkles?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Crushed nuts?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, laryngitis.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Here's your change, sir. Oh, and 
                         Austin--

               We cut back to the ICE CREAM MAN to see him pulling off a 
               very fake beard. It is BASIL (though it was clearly another 
               actor before).

                                     AUSTIN
                              (now with phlegmy 
                              throat)
                         Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Hello, Austin. What's wrong with 
                         your voice?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (still phlegmy throat)
                         I just had ice cream. Listen to me, 
                         I have dairy throat.  "Mary had a 
                         little lamb and it was always 
                         gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar 
                         gate and kicked it's little-

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (Interrupting)
                         Austin! Things are heating up, so I 
                         thought it best to contact you in 
                         disguise. Felicity, your plan worked. 
                         You and Austin track Fat Bastard 
                         back to Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But how can we track Fat Bastard?

                                     FELICITY
                         I planted a homing device on him 
                         last night.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Yes, and we're starting to pick up 
                         the signal now.

               Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that BEEPS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How did you get close enough to plant 
                         a homing device?

                                     FELICITY
                         I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.

               Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same 
               time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You... him? Just like that?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, Austin, we needed that 
                         information.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, 
                         we now know that-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         Did you use an elaborate set of 
                         pulleys? A block and tackle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Anyway, you two follow the signal 
                         back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and 
                         then-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         I just can't get my head around it, 
                         baby. You're so small and he's so 
                         ... not small. The sheer mechanics 
                         of it are mindboggling!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Never mind, Austin, you two have 
                         work to do. You must find Dr.  Evil.

               INT. BEETLE

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen built into the 
               dash.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got it! A Chinese basket with a 
                         counter-weighted ballast.  That's 
                         how you did it, right?

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, it almost sounds like you're 
                         jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who, me? That's not possible, baby!
                              (beat, to himself)
                         is it?

               Just then a-car pulls beside them. Two Dr. Evil Private Army 
               guys pull machine guns and start SHOOTING.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get down!

               Felicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS 
               from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD.

                                     FELICITY
                         We're obviously on the right track.
                              (re: tracking screen)
                         It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an 
                         island in the middle of the ocean.

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen.

               EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT

               The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach. 
               We still hear the BEEP-BEEP.

               EXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT

               Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the 
               Dr.  Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain 
               through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck.

                                     AUSTIN
                         According to the readings, Dr. Evil's 
                         headquarters is over the next ridge.

                                     FELICITY
                         Can I have a look?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is 
               still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.

                                     FELICITY
                         Question is, how do we get in?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (muffled)
                         Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, did you hear me?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I seem to be stuck in your dirty 
                         pillows.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where are the topographical maps 
                         that Basil drew up?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think they're in the tent.

               He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting 
               shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From 
               the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over 
               with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have 
               her hands up his butt.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Have you got it out yet?

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things 
                         do you put in there?

               The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage 
               links from his ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, anything that catches my fancy.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         How do you manage to fit it all in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, it stretches to fit.

               The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of 
               Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Are you almost done? I can't hold it 
                         much longer.

               INT. TENT

               We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent.

               Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent.

                                     FELICITY
                         Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing 
                         how much this duffel bag will hold.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

               We see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on 
               top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (singing)
                         'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US?
                         JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?'

               We see that Number Two and Frau are the audience. They 
               applaud.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I 
                         do have some bad news.  Powers' is 
                         on the island.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How tedious.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to 
                         him by using the girl.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I have the perfect weapon. Frau?

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Bring in the He-Bots!

               MUSIC: It's Rainina Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Three HE-BOTS 
               enter in unison. They are robotic studs in Logan's Run type 
               outfits.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots. 
                         What kind of woman could resist these 
                         perfect specimens of masculinity? 
                         Their clothes are stylish, their 
                         posture is ramrod straight, and their 
                         buttocks are tight, like tigers. 
                         And, each He-Bot is armed with a 
                         secret weapon.

               ANGLE ON THE FIRST HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours 
               out.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Poison gas...

               ANGLE ON THE SECOND HE-BOT.

               A gun barrel flips out form his crotch and FIRES machine-gun 
               style.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Machine gun...

               ANGLE ON THE THIRD HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles 
               out onto the floor, where it smokes.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         And deadly acid.

               Dr. Evil is disgusted by the last one.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. I object to the last one on 
                         aesthetic grounds, but I don't care 
                         how you get Powers, just bring him 
                         to me.
                              (to Mini-Me)
                         Ready Mini-Me? A one and a two and...
                              (singing)
                         ME, AND MY SHA-DOW STROLLING DOWN 
                         THE A-VA-
                              (rapidly)
                         WASN'T A STREET, WASN'T A ROAD
                         WASN'T A BOULEVARD
                              (dancing in step)
                         ME, AND MY SHA- OW ALL ALONE AND FEE-
                         LING...

                                     MINI-ME
                              (voice unnaturally 
                              low)
                         BLUE!

               EXT. TENT

               We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is 
               putting things into Austin's ass.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Do you want everything to go back 
                         in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat 
                         Bastard-

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         It's my job, Austin. You of all people 
                         should understand that.  Marakesh, 
                         1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I 
                         know your record backwards and 
                         forwards.  You've had more sex on 
                         the job than a Swedish stewardess.

               The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into 
               what appears to be Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         You're right, Felicity, I can't deny 
                         it. But the world changed, and I 
                         changed too.

               Pull back to reveal that THE HE-BOTS are watching. Felicity 
               shoves the tennis racket extra hard.

               Austin stands up rapidly.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Ow!
                              (beat)
                         My back hurts.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Are you OK?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         I'm fine, just keeping packing.

               The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - 60'S

               Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Christ Almighty, it smells terrible 
                         in here.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's the volcanic sulphurous 
                         emissions. We've put up some air 
                         fresheners.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Great, now it smells like someone 
                         took a shite in a pine tree.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded 
                         into the rocket. You're ready for 
                         launch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. 
                         I have so few pleasures, you know.

               Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private 
               Army Men.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome 
                         to my hollowed-out volcano.

                                     AUSTIN
                         We meet again, Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you 
                         alive is so you can feel the agony 
                         of watching my plan unfold.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil your plan will never--

               Austin trails off as he spots his MOJO in the beaker behind 
               Dr.  Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh, is that yours?

                                     AUSTIN
                         My mojo!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You know what they say: finders 
                         keepers, loser weepers.

                                     FELICITY
                         Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course. Why?

               Felicity kicks Dr. Evil in the balls.

                                     FELICITY
                         Now you've got a couple of achers.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oww! My stomach hurts!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wincing)
                         I don't care if he is evil, you don't 
                         give a man a shot in the pills. It's 
                         just not cricket, baby.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Take them away.

               The guards lead Austin and Felicity away.

                                     SCOTT

                         How are we going to get out of here?

                         Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard 
                         again?

                         Austin, that is it! I don't know 
                         what happened to you in the Nineties, 
                         but I'm still here, in the Sixties, 
                         and I still swing! Don't try to lay 
                         your hang-ups on me just because you 
                         lost your mojo! That one hurts.

                         Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.

                         I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap 
                         shot.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, baby, you're right. I was wrong 
                         to judge you. I guess I am... jealous.

                         But the Austin Powers I knew was 
                         wild and crazy and free. He could 
                         never be jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That Austin is gone. I've changed. I 
                         knew someone, not long ago, a very 
                         special woman. She taught me that 
                         life isn't about jumping into the 
                         sack with whoever comes along, it's 
                         about caring and responsibility. And 
                         while it is true she turned out to 
                         be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, 
                         I suppose I really did... love her.

                         Yes, Vanessa.

               Felicity is touched.

                         Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to 
                         understand everything you've gone 
                         through, but I trust you. I'll make 
                         you a deal: if we get out of here 
                         alive, I'll give monogamy a try.

                         desperately ill with food poisoning? 
                         The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, 
                         will come to investigate.  Meanwhile, 
                         you dig a pit and line it with 
                         makeshift punji sticks made from

                         That might work, but how about this?

               Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping 
               open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard. 
               We, however, can't see them.

               The guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin 
               is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce.

                         think?

               The guard follows her into the cell.

                         Almost... got it!

               Austin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

               Austin and Felicity run into the Main Room. It is strangely 
               dark and quiet.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where's your mojo, Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm not sure.

               MUSIC: It's Raining Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Suddenly, the 
               lights dim. The three He-Bots descend from the ceiling on 
               trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Watch out, baby, He-Bots!

               The He-Bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison, like 
               a perfect Olympic dismount. Their crotch nozzles flip up one 
               by one.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't fight them without my mojo.

                                     FELICITY
                         Who said anything about fighting?

               MUSIC: seductive music Felicity does a very seductive dance, 
               with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds. The He-Bots EXPLODE, 
               succumbing to her mojo.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing, Felicity, you were making 
                         me very horny, man! Extremely randy, 
                         indeed!

                                     FAT BASTARD (O.S.)
                         C'mon, give the lads a show. Take of 
                         your top. Put 'em on the glass! Make 
                         'em bounce. Let's have a look at 
                         your tits.

               Austin and Felicity turn to see Fat Bastard lurking in the 
               background.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Looking for this, Mr. Powers?

               Fat Bastard, holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen 
               private army men.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I give the orders, (bleep) for brains. 
                         Guards, take them back to their cells.

               Guards approach.

                                     FELICITY
                         Hold on, let me ask you one question.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, I guess I owe you that much 
                         for a night of carnal ecstasy.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         What kind of stupid ass question is 
                         that? I'm (bleep)in' rich and I'm up 
                         to my tits in clean stinky.

                                     FELICITY
                         You didn't answer my question, are 
                         you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I 
                         could lose a few pounds, but I could 
                         shiva git!

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, 
                         I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger 
                         titties than you do! I've got more 
                         (bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone 
                         book.  I've got more crack cheese 
                         than a (bleep)in' dairy. I've nay 
                         seen ma willie in two years. That's 
                         enough time to declare it legally 
                         deed! I can't stop eating. I eat 
                         because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy 
                         because I eat.
                              (starts to cry)
                         I'm caught in a cycle and there's no 
                         escape!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's 
                         a thin bastard, trying to get out

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Maybe there's big crap inside me 
                         trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough 
                         of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms. 
                         Listen, I've run the gamut of self- 
                         help books.  "Food isn't love", right, 
                         but how do you get it from the page 
                         to the (bleep)in' fork?  I'm so weak, 
                         I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, 
                         take the mojo.

               Fat Bastard hands over the mojo.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I appreciate you trying to reach me, 
                         no one can do it for me, I know this 
                         now.  There's a hole in my soul that 
                         food won't fill. This is the beginning 
                         of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym 
                         everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's 
                         someone I have to get in touch with 
                         and forgive... myself.
                              (pause)
                         Sorry. I farted.
                              (pause)
                         It's a long road ahead.

                         Hold on, I have something very 
                         important to do.

               Austin drinks the mojo.

                         Sound as a pound, my spuds are 
                         boiling. Fancy a shag?

                         Right, the moon. I think I know 
                         someone who can give us a lift.

                         There's been some sort of delay in 
                         the launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but 
                         we understand that America's first 
                         manned mission to the moon will be 
                         blasting off shortly.

               Pan across Austin in a spacesuit, then Felicity in her 
               spacesuit, then CAMEO ASTRONAUT in his space suit. They are 
               surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters.

                         Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket 
                         scientist to figure this stuff out.

                         I am a rocket scientist.

               A technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins.

                         We will have lift-off in T minus 10 
                         seconds... 9... 8... etc.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, if you get frightened, 
                         just hold my hand.

                         We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has 
                         cleared the tower and is heading for 
                         a rendezvous with the moon.

               INT. APOLLO CAPSULE

               The G-forces during lift-off are incredible. Austin's face 
               is pulled into a contorted mask which bares his teeth. His 
               hair sticks straight up and his glasses are twisted.

               Austin is terrified. He clutches Felicity's hand, then grabs 
               on to the astronaut beside him.

               Felicity, however, loves it.

                         felt like sitting on top of a bomb. 
                         As I punched through the atmosphere, 
                         I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled

                         This is one small step for man, but 
                         a giant step for shagging.  Can you

                         Mr. President, your time is up. This 
                         is your last chance to pay 100 billion 
                         dollars or see Washington DC 
                         destroyed.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         WARNING, LASER CALIBRATION!

               The ALARM continues to blare.

               INT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN)

               The President at his desk.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         What? I can't hear you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Pay me 100 billion dollars or see 
                         Washington DC destroyed!

               The ALARM BLARES.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         I'm sorry, I just can't hear you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (louder)
                         How about now?

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Better.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         The Capital will be destroyed-

               The ALARM BLARES.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Sorry! I just can't- I think it's 
                         that alarm.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Could someone shut off that frickin' 
                         alarm? I'm trying to hold the free 
                         world hostage here. Honestly.
                              (shouting)
                         WILL DESTROY WASHINGTON DC UNLESS 
                         YOU PAY ME-

               The ALARM SHUTS OFF but Dr. Evil is still shouting.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (shouting)
                         100 BILLION DOLLARS!

               His yelling startles even himself.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Please Dr. Evil, be reasonable. That's 
                         more money than is in the entire 
                         Federal Treasury!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh well, I guess you have one minute 
                         to- "show me the money"!

                                     PRESIDENT
                         I still don't know what that means. 
                         I can't show you the money because 
                         we don't have the money.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Then I suppose you're up shit's crick 
                         without a paddle.

               INT. NASA CONTROL ROOM

               A white room with a bank of old-fashioned computers and a 
               tracking screen. Basil, several GENERALS, and other VIPs 
               look anxiously over the shoulder of the MISSION CONTROL 
               SPECIALISTS.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the 
                         moon. We'll soon know whether he has 
                         succeeded or whether the world will 
                         be destroyed!

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - HALLWAY

               Austin and Felicity enter through a hatch and step out of 
               their spacesuits.

                                     FELICITY
                         Let's find Dr. Evil.

               Suddenly, Austin notices something.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shhh...

               He points. We see a profile through a sheet of frosted glass. 
               It is Dr. Evil's distinctive profile, with a machine gun. 
               Austin takes careful aim and FIRES.  We see the SHADOW take 
               the hit, and fall.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, you've done it! You got Dr. 
                         Evil!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course I did, baby, I got my mojo 
                         working overtime.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, I'm going ahead. Cover my 
                         rear!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Felicity runs ahead. Austin runs over to where the shadow 
               came from. He sees that it was not Dr. Evil, but MINI-ME, 
               carrying a little gun. Austin is ashamed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger. He's so small, 
                         he's like a dog or something.

               Austin chokes back a tear.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger.
                              (realizing)
                         Felicity, be careful! Dr. Evil is 
                         still alive! Felicity?

               Austin runs after her.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

               Austin rounds the corner and comes upon Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (holding his gun on 
                              Dr. Evil)
                         Alright, slap-head, turn around. 
                         Slowly.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Aren't you forgetting something?

               A wall panel in the main chamber revolves, revealing FELICITY, 
               enclosed in a glass tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!
                              (to Dr. Evil)
                         What have you done to her?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't worry, she's not dead... yet.

               Brightly colored GAS starts to fill the glass chamber.

                                     FELICITY
                              (muffled through glass)
                         Don't worry about me Austin. You've 
                         got to save the world!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice, 
                         Powers: save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

               Austin is torn. He looks back and forth between Felicity and 
               the laser which is on the other side of the room.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got my mojo back, man, I can do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         We'll see. Fire the laser!

               The woman manning the laser's joystick begins to MOVE IT. 
               Austin leaps across the room and reaches her just in time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hands off my joystick, baby.

               He wrestles with her a moment and then KNOCKS IT ASKEW.

               EXT. SPACE

               The laser beam hits the Big Boy Rocket in the crotch and Big 
               Boy's eyes cross in pain.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Damn you, Powers!

               Dr. Evil hits a SELF-DESTRUCT button. An ALARM blares.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Warning! Self-destruct sequence 
                         initiated!

               The base is rocked by EXPLOSIONS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Perhaps you spoke too soon.

               Austin looks over. Felicity has slumped over in the tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Noooooo!

               Austin BANGS on the glass with his fists.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake 
                         up! Please God, don't take her away.

               It is too late. Dr. Evil runs through the TIME PORTAL and 
               gets away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, you have to understand, I 
                         thought I had my mojo back.  This 
                         isn't fair.

               Austin looks up to the heavens. We see a quick--

               FLASHBACK - MONTAGE

               of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first 
               kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self.

               A tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against 
               the glass as if trying to reach her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love you, Felicity! I know I 
                         couldn't say it before, but I really 
                         do love you!
                              (enraged)
                         Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!

               Austin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block 
               his path. Austin is like an animal.

               He charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and 
               takes a bite out of it.

               Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE 
               OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground.

               The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists 
               simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE 
               A PUMPKIN.

               Austin runs over to the TIME PORTAL set for "75 BC". He runs 
               through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROMAN VILLA - 75 BC

               An orgy is taking place. Dr. Evil is in a toga with a laurel 
               with two YOUNG ROMAN MEN feeding him grapes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You make love to your wife out of 
                         duty, your mistress for pleasure, 
                         and a Roman boy for ecstasy.
                              (noticing Austin)
                         Shit.

               He runs away as Austin appears through the TIME PORTAL. Austin 
               follows Dr. Evil into another TIME PORTAL marked "1975".

               EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD -

               Austin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting 
               into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO 
               with a white stripe pulls over.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I have to commandeer this vehicle.
                              (noticing)
                         Hey, aren't you Hutch?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

               We see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY).

                                     PAUL MICHAEL GLASER
                         I'm Starsky.

                                     DAVID SOUL
                         I'm Hutch.

               Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car 
               disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino 
               follows.

               A sign at the car wash reads: "1911"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DECK OF THE TITANIC -

               Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic" 
               stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with 
               Austin hot on his heels.

                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                         Iceberg, dead ahead!

               Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, 
               KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by.

                                     JAMES CAMERON
                         I'm king of the world!

               Dr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL 
               they just came from.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY -

               Dr. Evil runs into the street with Austin chasing him. In 
               SLO-MO Austin dives for a ridiculously long time, and TACKLES 
               Dr.  Evil, pinning him.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (breathing heavily)
                         Before you do that, know this: Austin, 
                         I am... your... father.

                         Really?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No. I can't back that up. I was just 
                         grasping at straws. I had nothing. 
                         But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers, 
                         you really have become a product of 
                         the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How so?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You're more interested in your job 
                         as glorified policeman than you are 
                         in love. You won the battle, but I 
                         won the war. Love means nothing, 
                         you've proved it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't think that Felicity was 
                         going to die, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What a cowardly response. I'm 
                         disappointed really. You have the 
                         power to go back in time and save 
                         her, but it means letting me go.

               Austin looks over and sees a TIME PORTAL. Through it he can 
               glimpse the lair, and Felicity.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going 
                         to be? Me or the girl?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!

               Austin runs through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - 60'S

               We see the scene from a moment ago. Felicity is in the glass 
               tube and the BRIGHTLY COLORED GAS is starting to fill it.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice: 
                         save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I choose love, baby.

               Austin runs over to the glass tube and SMASHES HIS FIST 
               through it. The glass SHATTERS and Austin pulls Felicity 
               out. She gasps for air.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I love you.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That was another place and another 
                         time, baby.

               Austin kisses her for a long time. She starts to twitch.

               She struggles. She hits him in the head and he finally stops 
               kissing her.

                                     FELICITY
                              (gasping)
                         Can't. Breathe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry, baby, I got a little over- 
                         stimulated.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fire the laser!

                                     AUSTIN
                         What do we do?

                                     FELICITY
                         Use your mojo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         I don't have it!

                                     FELICITY
                         Trust me, you do!

               Austin turns and gives a 'who me?' look over his bottom. The 
               woman arming the laser stumbles backwards into the directional 
               control just as it FIRES.

               The Big Boy Rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes

               emerge in their place.

               The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross 
               over to the TIME PORTAL in a dramatic series of acrobatic 
               flips and stunts.

               The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed 
               pile of barrels. Austin and Felicity emerge in their place

                         Or so he thought.

               FROM THE FIRST MOVIE: Austin and Vanessa snuggle in bed. She 
               plays with his chest hair.

                                     VANESSA
                         I love you, Mr. Powers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         And I love you, Mrs. Powers.

               SHOT TO MATCH EXISTING FOOTAGE: Austin gets out of bed. We

                         Let's go out on the terrace. It's a 
                         beautiful night, we can look at the 
                         stars.

                         Look how beautiful the night sky is.

                                     VANESSA
                         Isn't that the big dipper?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (sheepish)
                         Well, you know.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hey, I've never seen that big star 
                         before.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, what is that?

               Austin pulls out his telescope and takes a look.

                         This isn't over yet, Mr. Powers. I 
                         have one more trick up my sleeve, 
                         don't I Mr. Bigglesworth?

               The frozen Mr. Bigglesworth MEOWS.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Bob's Big Boy rocket. Suddenly, a hatch opens in Bob's 
               rear end and Dr. Evil's silver egg capsule poops out.

               SFX: PLOOP!

               Capsule begins fiery re-entry to Earth

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               Austin comes in and shuts the balcony door.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh well, I guess it was nothing.

               A VANESSA DOUBLE crosses carrying a bouquet of flowers, which 
               obscure her face.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for some champagne?
                              (pouring)
                         Here's to monotony-- I mean, monogamy!

               Vanessa sits at the vanity with her back turned.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello? Vanessa? What are you doing, 
                         luv?

                                     VANESSA
                              (back turned)
                         Just putting on my--

               As Vanessa turns around she puts her hands up and PULLS OFF 
               HER FACE revealing wires, transistors, and a speaker where 
               her mouth should be.

                                     FEMBOT VANESSA
                              (computer voice)
                         MAKE-UP!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (frightened)
                         Vanessa, you're a Fembot!

               They fight. Midway through the fight, machine guns pop out 
               of Vanessa's breasts.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss 
                         those?

                                     VANESSA
                              (robot voice)
                         PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD TRY 
                         FOREPLAY.

               Her machine gun breasts FIRE, spraying the room in SLO-MO.

               Then they run out of ammo and CLICK, CLICK.

               Austin empties his gun into the robot, but to no avail. She 
               rushes at him, he gives her a judo chop, also to no avail. 
               Then Austin' notices a SELF-DESTRUCT switch and hits it.

               She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she EXPLODES.

               Fembot parts fly around the room. Austin sits on the bed, 
               saddened. He holds Vanessa's hand, which has wires hanging 
               out of it. On one of the fingers is her wedding ring.

               MUSIC: VERY SAD PIANO

                                     AUSTIN
                              (very sad)
                         I can't believe Vanessa, my bride, 
                         my one true love, the woman who taught 
                         me the beauty of sharing your whole 
                         life with another, the person who 
                         taught me the meaning of love, was a 
                         Fembot. How will I ever go on?
                              (beat)
                         Wait a tic! That means I'm single! 
                         Oh, behave!

               INT. LOBBY - HOTEL

               Rich European guests mill about the luxurious lobby. Suddenly, 
               Austin dances through naked. Just as we are about to see his 
               bits and pieces, a man lifts up his suitcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and 
                         free!

               SEQUENCE CREDIT

               MUSIC: Soul Bassanova by QUINCY JONES PAN UP Austin's NAKED 
               body as he walks down a boardwalk. Just as the camera reaches 
               that most sensitive of areas, a credit appears STARRING MIKE 
               MYERS. Austin gives a big 'who me?' and we

               FREEZE FRAME.

               EXT. BOARDWALK - FRENCH RIVERA

               European types stare and point. We see Austin from behind. 
               His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. The bicycle moves 
               away. Just as Austin's bum is about to be revealed-

               A CREDIT APPEARS blocking it. Austin turns his head around 
               to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!' 
               take and we FREEZE FRAME.

               A MAN IN A RAINCOAT flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a 
               credit. Austin just laughs...crazy, man!

               Austin goes around a corner. A moment later he returns, 
               followed by a NUDE MARCHING BAND.

               A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude 
               Beach". Austin enters from the left.

               We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. Just as he 
               is about to appear from behind the sign, a...

               CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis 
               lengthwise as he walks.

               NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE

               A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her 
               bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be 
               suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears.

               The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl. 
               The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit 
               "BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the 
               "PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest.

               Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS 
               appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of 
               nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing 
               CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.

               A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are 
               blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.

               Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out 
               from his waist. Austin looks proud.

               A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier 
               weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND 
               MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.

               Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit 
               "DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits 
               in mid-air:

               FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING" 
               AD.  Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH."

               Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shaguar, baby, yeah!

               CU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar" 
               where it would normally read "Jaguar".

               The car speeds off.

               A handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the

                         He's in outer space, like frozen in 
                         a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big

                         you, Scott. Let's bring out

                         father, Dr Evil.

               Dr Evil enters.

                         Hello Scott, I'm back.

                                     SCOTT
                         I can't believe you'd do this to me 
                         on national television!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         They offered me a free makeover.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the 
                         fathers here today open up to their 
                         sons, sons to the fathers. Is there 
                         anything you'd like to share?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Share?

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Yes, don't you have any secrets?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK. I have a vestigial tail.

               Everyone is a little grossed out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's more of a nub, really. The spine 
                         just goes on a little longer than it 
                         should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, 
                         perform fellatio once and you're a 
                         poet, twice and you're a homosexual. 
                         I remember once I was being fisted 
                         by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where 
                         the story gets interesting. He was 
                         lactose-intolerant. He could eat red 
                         meat all night long, but one sip of 
                         milk and it was gastric hell. And I 
                         remember we were caught in fragrance 
                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you 
                         can imagine my humiliation at having 
                         Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no 
                         teeth." One of my greatest 
                         disappointments is that I never became 
                         a song and dance man. I could have 
                         been a quadruple threat, kind of 
                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, 
                         singer, actor, and I would possess 
                         nuclear weapons, the latter being 
                         the most threatening of the four. I 
                         once sat on a bus and tried to will 
                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended 
                         up with was a sense of failure and a 
                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth 
                         and perhaps a grudging respect for 
                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. 
                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I 
                         slept in a horse once. It was quite 
                         roomy. On second thought, it was the 
                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' 
                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I 
                         wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the 
                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I 
                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy 
                         of The Fonze while I was in coma 
                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer 
                         hash, but who at the end of the day 
                         can honestly say they haven't done 
                         that?

               The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once 
               quiet.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         What are you, some kind of freak?

                                     SCOTT
                         Shut up, jagoff!

               Studio audience whoops at this.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         I'll kick your ass punk!

               Crowd goes crazy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No one talks to my boy that way!

               Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.  
               Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm OK, I'm OK.

               There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking 
               him down.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new 
                         evil lair.

               EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY

               We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the 
               top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and 
               the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.

               INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM

               The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks 
               paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, 
               and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is 
               a Starbucks.

               Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and 
               lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW 
               HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot 
               coffee products.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman 
                         of your organization, I seized upon 
                         the opportunity to invest in a small 
                         Seattle-based coffee company several 
                         years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-
                         flung empire with 2000 outlets 
                         worldwide.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a 
                         good cuppa joe.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         If I may continue, I believe if we 
                         shift our resources away from world 
                         domination and focus on providing 
                         premium quality coffee drinks, we 
                         can increase our gross profits 
                         fivefold.

               Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY 
               MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Perhaps you've confused me 
                         with someone who gives a shit.  Might 
                         I remind you that I run the show 
                         here? I demand a little respect.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (indicating Dr. Evil's 
                              milk mustache)
                         Dr. Evil, I think you--

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Silence! I will not tolerate your 
                         insolence! Remember what happened 
                         last time.

               FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)

               Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit.

               INT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS

               Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         May I add, I appreciate you 
                         reinstating me after our little... 
                         misunderstanding.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?

               We see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before.

                                     FRAU
                         Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How are things?

                                     FRAU
                         I have come to embrace the love that 
                         dare not speak it's name. To my right 
                         is my lover.

               We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous 
               eyebrow.

                                     FRAU
                         Her name is Unibrau. I met her on 
                         the LPGA Tour.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.

               Dr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy 
               milk mustache even larger.

                                     FRAU
                         Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (wiping it off, 
                              embarrassed)
                         Oh, I know. I know.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the 
                         Greek assassin, Oedipus.

               We see a swarthy Greek army guy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. 
                         Excited?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         I could give a shit.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Kiss your mother with that mouth?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         Yes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course you do.

               Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his 
               control panel, but Number Two interrupts.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing throat)
                         Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at 
                         which you liquidate henchmen far 
                         exceeds our ability to replace them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have so few pleasures left to me, 
                         Number Two. The key to life is to 
                         rotate your vices. One day it's 
                         executions, another day it's creamy 
                         French cheese.  It's like frickin' 
                         heroin.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the 
                         answer. While you were frozen, we 
                         began a program to clone you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Cool.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         We had a few glitches, but I think 
                         you'll be pleased with the results.

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Send in the clone!

               MUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching 
               figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and 
               scarier.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         He is identical to you in every way, 
                         except he is one-eighth your size.

               We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL, 
               just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. 
               Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding 
               his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini-
                         Me.
                              (to clone)
                         Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.

               Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command 
               chair.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Mr. Bigglesworth!

               The bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's 
               lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's 
               lap.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-me, something to eat?
                              (expectant pause)
                         No?
                              (pause)
                         OK.
                              (to room)
                         Tired.  Gentleman, I have a plan. As 
                         you know, the most powerful man in 
                         the world is the President of the 
                         United States. But he is just that- 
                         a man, subject to temptations of the 
                         flesh like any other man. Here's 
                         what we do: we make it seem that the 
                         President has had "extra-marital 
                         oral relations" with- and this is 
                         the kicker-

               DRAMATIC STING, SNAP ZOOM TO DR. EVIL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         With a White House intern!

               Dr. Evil gloats. So does Mini-Me.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing his throat)
                         Uh-hem.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What, that already happened?

               Number Two nods.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, 
                         how about a frickin' time machine? 
                         Does the president have a time 
                         machine? Have I been scooped on that?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         No, not that I'm aware of.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, time machine it is. As you 
                         know, every diabolical scheme I've 
                         hatched has been thwarted by Austin 
                         Powers. And why is that, ladies and 
                         gentlemen?

                                     SCOTT
                         Because you never kill him when you 
                         get the chance and you're a dope?

               Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott 
               Evil" button on Dr. Evil's control panel.

               Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle. Mini-Me glares at Scott 
               and GIVES HIM THE FINGER.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, because Austin Powers has "mojo".

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Mojo?

                                     FRAU
                         Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, 
                         the essence, the libido, the "right 
                         stuff".

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's what the French call a certain 
                         'I don't know what.'

                                     SCOTT
                         If you've got a time machine, why 
                         don't you just go back and kill Austin 
                         Powers when he's a baby or something?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, no, no.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (interrupting)
                         Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to 
                         use your knowledge of the future to 
                         play the stock market? We could 
                         literally make trillions.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (smug laugh to himself)
                         Why make trillions when we could 
                         make...
                              (pause)
                         Billions?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Excuse me?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Why think small is all I'm saying.

                                     SCOTT
                         A trillion is more than a billion, 
                         numb-nuts.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Zip it. Unveil the time portal!

               A wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of 
               shimmering energy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the 
                         time portal. As you know, Austin 
                         Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, 
                         I time travel to 1969, two years 
                         after he was frozen. Security will 
                         be lax and I'll strike when he is 
                         totally helpless.

               First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination 
               of the world.

                                     SCOTT
                         Can I come?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, Scott, Daddy has a score to 
                         settle. Austin Powers is the snake 
                         to my mongoose, or the mongoose to 
                         my snake. Either way it's bad, I 
                         don't know animals. But I do know 
                         this: This time it's personal. Frau, 
                         Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969. 
                         Come, Mini-Me.

               Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him 
               perfectly. They enter the portal.

               There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in 
               Star Trek.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR -

               Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal 
               into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room 
               dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A 
               younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in 
               an eye-patch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number 
                         Two, you look very youthful and 
                         healthy.
                              (turning to Frau)
                         And Frau you look...right.

               As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise 
               from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets 
               caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is 
               frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK, people, we now officially have a 
                         chair problem. If another one of 
                         these chairs hits me in the nuts, 
                         I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want 
                         you to meet Number Two.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hello there.

               Mini-me says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me?

               Mini-me still says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shy. Low blood sugar.
                              (to room)
                         Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I 
                         have an operative inside the Ministry 
                         of Defense. By this time tomorrow, 
                         Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.

               Dr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (maniacal laugh)
                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND -

               We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of 
               a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the 
               side of a volcano on a tropical island.

                                     DR. EVIL (V.O.)
                              (maniacal laugh)
                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               INT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM -

               We see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it, 
               we see two digital clocks. One reads:

               CURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN: 
               NOVEMBER 11, 1967. One of the SCOTS GUARDS, is an IMMENSELY 
               FAT SCOTTISH SOLDIER (played by Mike Myers).

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         We've had reports that there's a spy 
                         in the Ministry of Defense.  The 
                         contents of this room are vital to 
                         the country. Be on special alert.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                              (thick Scottish accent)
                         Those bastards will have to kill me 
                         before I let anything happen to this 
                         wee naked hairy popsicle, sir!

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         Very good. And try and lose some 
                         weight for God's sake!

               They exchange salutes and the Colonel exits.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                         Yessir!
                              (sotto after the 
                              Colonel)
                         I outta smash your teeth out with a 
                         Toffee Hammer Mr. English Colonel 
                         Telling-Me-What-To-Do-And-Stealing-

                         Scottish-Independence!

               The Fat Soldier begins to play the BAGPIPES, a white vapor 
               comes out of them, filling the room.

               The other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious.

               He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech 
               syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places 
               it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green, 
               indicating FULL MOJO.

               EXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY

               Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS 
               COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly 
               Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge 
               reads empty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's 
                         funny, I just filled the Shaguar up 
                         this morning.

               Austin hits a button on the dashboard.

               BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of 
                         British Intelligence.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You always are, Basil. Listen, the 
                         weirdest thing just happened, I've 
                         run out of petrol.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         We'll send a man around immediately. 
                         How was your honeymoon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She 
                         was a Fembot!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Ah women, who can understand them? 
                         Moving on, let's discuss your new 
                         case.

                                     AUSTIN
                         New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         You'll be doing a photo shoot. We 
                         know that one of the models is an ex-
                         KGB agent selling top secret material 
                         to the highest bidder.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That sounds easy enough, you know 
                         what they say: all work and no 
                         shagging makes Austin a dull boy, 
                         man!

               INT. SKI LODGE

               Austin sets up his photo equipment. The room is decorated in 
               classic Heffner- bear skin rugs, leather chairs, roaring 
               fire.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Tres chic, baby.

               REG, the photo assistant, enters.

                                     REG
                         Austin, the models are ready.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ta, Reg. Bless your cotton socks. 
                         Hey, Reg, do you have any hobbies?

                                     REG
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hobbies, man! I for one enjoy making 
                         models!

               The models make their entrance. They are REAL SUPERMODELS, 
               say CINDY CRAWFORD, REBECCA ROMAJIN and also one MODEL we 
               don't know.

                         Powers!

               Austin shoots a look to Reg like 'still got it, baby.'

                                     AUSTIN
                         One at a time, girls. One. At. A.

                         Hi, I'm Cindy. I don't believe I've 
                         had the pleasure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course you haven't had "The 
                         Pleasure", we just met, baby, yeah!

                                     REBECCA
                         How do you do, Austin? I'm Rebecca.

                         Thank you. Your breasts are amazing.

               Austin comes to the unknown model. She is tall and angular.

                                     AUSTIN
                         And what's your name, baby?

                         And I vanna toilet made of solid 
                         gold but it's just not in the cards, 
                         now is it?

               Austin looks over the girls, trying to decide who is the 
               spy.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                              (inner monologue)
                         Now, which one is the Russian spy? 
                         Cindy Crawford, Rebecca Romajin... 
                         or Ivana Humpalot? Think, man, think!

               Austin begins snapping pictures. The sequence is shot like a 
               photo shoot, with freeze frames, etc.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, baby! Love it. Turn and 
                         pout for me baby! Smashing!

               Cindy gets on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great, darling. Give me some shoulder. 
                         Yes, yes, yes.
                              (angry)
                         No! No!

                              (to Rebecca)
                         Show me love. Smashing! You're an 
                         animal. You're a tiger. Be a tiger, 
                         baby! You're great! You're Grrrrrr-
                         eat! You're Tony, be corn flakes, 
                         baby, be frosted. Now be a lemur, 
                         baby! You're a ring-tailed lemur.

               Rebecca looks confused.

                                     REBECCA
                         A lemur?

                                     AUSTIN
                         A small mammal native to the African 
                         savannah. C'mon baby, you know. Like 
                         this!
                              (imitating lemur)
                         OK, predator coming! Now, burrow, 
                         burrow! You're a lemur. It's all 
                         you've got.
                              (beat)
                         I take it back. Be a tiger again. 
                         Smashing!

                         And... done! I'm spent!

               Austin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it.

                                     REG
                         Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot 
                         and I are going to have a 'private 
                         session'.

               Reg shows the girls out as they PROTEST. Austin and Ivana 
               are left alone. Austin CLAPS TWICE and the lights dim. He 
               CLAPS again and the fire goes up.

                                     IVANA
                         When did you get "The Clapper"?

                                     AUSTIN
                         November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, 
                         shore leave.

                                     IVANA
                         Are you cold, Mr. Powers?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I once had a bad experience with 
                         frostbite. I had to dip my tadger 
                         into a brandy snifter.

               Ivana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby.

                                     IVANA
                         Do you know how we keep warm in 
                         Russia?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can guess, baby.

                                     IVANA
                         We play chess.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I guessed wrong.

                                     IVANA
                         It takes a keen intelligence to play 
                         chess. Of course, you know what they 
                         say about men with big brains, don't 
                         you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         They wear large hats?

                                     IVANA
                         No, they make better lovers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wrong again.

               Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in 
               The Thomas Crowne Affair).

                                     IVANA
                         I assume you know how to play.

               She runs the bishop across her lips sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course.  The... horsey... moves 
                         in an L shape.

               Austin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let's stop playing games with each 
                         other... especially difficult ones. 
                         May I ask you a question, Miss 
                         Humpalot?

                                     IVANA
                         Of course.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny? Do I?

               Austin rolls around on the polar bear rug.

                                     IVANA
                         I'll tell you anything you want to 
                         know, just make love to me.

               She pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair.

                                     IVANA
                         You are hairy, like an animal!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (growling and barking)
                         Grrrr, baby.

               Austin takes the head of the bear skin rug.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf!
                              (covers the bear's 
                              eyes)
                         Wait a tick, I don't want him watching 
                         me while I'm on the job!

                                     IVANA
                         Make love to me, monkey man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy, baby!

               We pan around the room, seeing all the stuffed and mounted 
               wildlife who seem to be watching. Suddenly the camera stops. 
               So does the music.

                                     IVANA (O.S.)
                         What's the matter?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Basil enters. Cross between a hospital room and a lab. Austin 
               lies in bed hooked up to lots of monitoring equipment.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, I came as soon as I heard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         There must be some kind of mistake, 
                         Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't 
                         know it.

               Austin holds his neck very stiffly.

                         What's wrong with your neck, Austin?

                         I took a Viagra and it got caught in 
                         my throat. I've had a stiff neck for 
                         hours. Basil, is it true? Have I 
                         lost my mojo?

                         We're going to run a few tests, 
                         Austin. Don't worry, old friend, 
                         we'll get to the bottom of this.

                         Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin. 
                         Not only were you actually reading 
                         an article in that Playboy, but a 
                         candy-stripe nurse offering to give 
                         you a sponge bath didn't so much as 
                         turn your head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait, I can explain, man! I was going 
                         to shag her but the article was so 
                         fascinating--

                         true: you've lost your mojo.

               Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY.

                         Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think 
                         it's time to retire.

                         I'm afraid that's not possible, 
                         Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has 
                         returned.

               Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous 
               villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Our researcher noticed that these 
                         photos from the archives have changed. 
                         That means Dr. Evil is traveling 
                         back in time and creating alliances 
                         with each decade's most despised 
                         villains.

               Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't read in the car. I get a bit 
                         vomy.

               Austin burps and swallows it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Got it. I almost gipped.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.)
                         Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is 
                         in the year 1969. Luckily, we also 
                         have a time travel device. After 
                         years of research we've developed a 
                         machine that will transport you back 
                         to the Sixties.

               A bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new 
               VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by 
               Peter Max.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But Basil, isn't that the new 
                         Volkswagen Beetle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         That's what they'd like you to 
                         believe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 
                         and I was frozen in 1967, I could go 
                         look at my frozen self. But, if I'm 
                         still frozen in 1967, how could I 
                         have been unthawed in the 90's and 
                         traveled back to the Sixties?
                              (goes cross-eyed)
                         Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (to camera)
                         I suggest you don't worry about those 
                         things and just enjoy yourself.

               Austin gets into the car and turns it on.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This is smashing Basil. I'll go back 
                         to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, 
                         defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time 
                         for tea.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Good luck, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.

               Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and 
               smashes some equipment.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.
                              (changing gears)
                         Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, 
                         yeah!

               The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, 
               leaving flaming tread marks.

               FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - LONDON -

               The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches 
               to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws 
               the hukka down. Austin hops out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I feel better already, man!

               Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being 
               TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.

               EXT. PARK - LONDON

               Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see 
               that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big 
               ARYAN ASSASSIN.

               PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 
               watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who 
               she is.

               A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of 
               all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. 
               The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!

               Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of 
               the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage 
               and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: 
               "SEXUAL REVOLUTION."

               Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number 
               begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet 
               Charity or Hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU 
                         CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE 
                         SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY 
                         JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

               Hip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES 
                         US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER
                         THAN THE SWORD

               Austin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM 
               SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU 
                         AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING 
                         IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET

               Forty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH.  
                         WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'

               Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines 
               for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman 
               are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we 
               see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE 
               SYMBOL MEDALLION.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE--
                         SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE
                         OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!

               Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms 
               outstretched.

               The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera.

                                     EVERYONE
                              (chanting)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (louder)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (louder)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (shouting)
                         IT'S THE SIXTIES!

               The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with 
               their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily 
               and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

               We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is 
               the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES 
               behind the binoculars hiding her face.

               37 EXT. CARNABY ST.

               Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.

               Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

               The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.

               The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.

               The business man nods to a BOBBY.

               The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.

               The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.

               The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.

               The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.

               The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.

               The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

               The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.

               The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR 
               on a double-decker bus.

               The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

               The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.

               INT. CITROEN

               The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole 
               nodding sequence was a circular waste of time.

               EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES

               Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at 
               him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds 
               a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a 
               wall by hugging himself.

               The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his 
               gun.

               Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.

               It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps 
               out.

               We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a 
               sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing 
               suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol 
               medallion.

               She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

               MUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME

                                     FELICITY
                         Care for a ride?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my Beetle, baby.

                                     FELICITY
                         It was your Beetle. Get in.

               Austin dives in as the assassin FIRES. The car speeds off.

               INT. BEETLE (REAR PROJECTION)

               Felicity drives expertly.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin Powers, I presume?

                         Powers by name, Powers by reputation.

                                     FELICITY
                         Felicity Shagwell, CIA. Shagwell by 
                         name, Shag-very-Well by reputation.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (turning to camera)
                         Crazy, baby!

               EXT. ROAD

               The Beetle zips along, and then-- the Citroen appears behind 
               it.

               The assassin FIRES.

               INT. BEETLE

               Felicity turns around to look.

                                     FELICITY
                         Grab the wheel, would you?

               Austin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun. She turns 
               and FIRES out the window.

               EXT. ROAD

               The assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and 
               he jumps out as it goes over.

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three 
               times before it EXPLODES.

               EXT. CLIFF

               The assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand. He falls.

                                     ASSASSIN
                         Ahhhhhhhh!

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and 
               tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too, 
               EXPLODES.

                                     FELICITY
                         Well, Austin, I think this time you 
                         may have met your match.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and 
                         I'll beat him again.

                                     FELICITY
                         I was talking about me.

               She smiles, turns, and walks away.

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD

               The room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing 
               illumination. Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an 
               elevator into the middle of the spotlight.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Welcome to my shag pad, baby.

               Light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi-
               fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin.

               Austin blows DUST off a table.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for something to drink?

               Austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a 
               wetbar.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Or perhaps something to read?

               Austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a 
               button. It revolves to reveal a bookcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How about a hot cup of coffee?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, I rather fancy a grind.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, Behave!

               Austin hits a button and an automatic coffee-pourer pours a 
               cup.

               Austin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the 
               floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into 
               place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a 
               reel-to-reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of 
               massage oils.

               Felicity lies on her stomach. Austin begins to massage her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How does that feel, baby?

                                     FELICITY
                         Mmm, lower.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (lowering his voice)
                         HOW DOES THAT FEEL, BABY?

               They laugh. Austin continues to massage her.

                                     FELICITY
                         Wait, something's itching me.

               She reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening 
               dress, revealing her naked back.

                                     FELICITY
                         That's better.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crikey!!!

               Austin GULPS and accidentally spurts way too much oil on 
               her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.

               Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (talking to his crotch)
                         Hello, anyone home? C'mon lads, do 
                         it for England.

               Austin takes a peak-- nothing. He is panicked.

                                     FELICITY
                         Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity 
                         stretches very sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you 'like to see my etchings?

                                     FELICITY
                              (sexy)
                         I think I'm ready for bed.

               She moves close to Austin. He slides to the other side of 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get you some PJs.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I'm ready for bed.

               She moves over to him. He avoids her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth 
                         then.

               Austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. Felicity finally 
               grabs him and pins him to the bed.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I want to have sex with you, 
                         Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello Vicar!

                                     FELICITY
                         I've studied everything about you- 
                         your methods, your accomplishments, 
                         your preferences. You're the reason 
                         I became a spy. Now, I've waited two 
                         years to meet you, so I say we get 
                         busy making up for lost time.

               Austin sits up.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (reflective)
                         Felicity, I used to think that way, 
                         too, but I guess... I guess I've 
                         changed.  Not to make a short story 
                         long, or to ramble on and on, or to 
                         keep talking in a repetitive manner 
                         ad infinitum until it becomes 
                         impossible to remember what I was 
                         talking about in the first place, 
                         but- where was I?

               MUSIC: SAD INSTRUMENTAL

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. 
                         I've lost my mojo.

                                     FELICITY
                              (obviously disappointed)
                         Oh.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I thought coming back to the Sixties 
                         would bring it back, but it hasn't.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, don't worry. I know just the 
                         man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo 
                         recommended him and he's the best.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby!

               projection of India.

               It looks like a mosque, with incense, tapestries, and 
               DISCIPLES.  Austin and Felicity enter.

                         There he is. That's my guru.

               We see the GURU PITKA (played by Mike), an Indian man in a 
               bright red sari.

                                     FELICITY
                         Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin 
                         Powers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How are you baby?

                                     GURU PITKA
                         My chakras are aligned and I am in a 
                         perfect state of equipoise.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Good on ya. I don't know what that 
                         means but it sounds fab.

                                     FELICITY
                         Guru, we need some advice.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Hold your horses and any other beasts-
                         of burden. I must lead my disciples 
                         in meditation and then I will help 
                         you.

               The Guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples 
               sink to their knees.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhh!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a 
                         spiritual teacher and I have combined 
                         many disparate disciplines into a 
                         unified movement of human potentiality 
                         and equipoise that I learned from my 
                         guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste 
                         man who died mysteriously of a disease 
                         that strangely had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis. He would say to me, 
                         Sparky, love is all, life is breath.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhh!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, perhaps you are wondering where 
                         I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, 
                         when we were young we used to play a 
                         game called "Stinkmop". We would 
                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop 
                         into it, and play tag. I did not 
                         care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise 
                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, 
                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name 
                         kind of stuck.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, the reason I am a spiritualist 
                         instead of a therapist is that 
                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' 
                         and that will not help us attain 
                         potentiality. Now what is 
                         potentiality? It is the ability to 
                         achieve those goals that we wish to 
                         achieve for ourselves. People often 
                         say to me that they feel "nowhere", 
                         and I am going to change that to 
                         "Now here."

               The guru holds up a card which says "NOWHERE = NOW HERE!"

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         And you have many assumptions about 
                         your goals, but when you "assume" 
                         You make an "ass" out of "u" and 
                         "me".

               Guru holds up a card which says "ASSUME = ASS - U - ME."

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh....

                                     GURU PITKA
                         The being, or that which we call 
                         'ourselves', is not the tinker.  It 
                         is not the taughts. It is the Gap 
                         between the tinker and the taughts! 
                         We are not our mind, we are not our 
                         body, we are the Gap!

               Guru holds up a card that says "NOT TINKER, NOT TAUGHTS, BUT 
               THE GAP" with the familiar Gap font.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                              (rapid fire)
                         The heart of the matter is that you 
                         are the heart of the matter.  There 
                         is no "I" in "team". Beer before 
                         liquor, never sicker. Don't take a 
                         wooden nickel.  If your pipe is short 
                         and your pump is weak, you better 
                         stand close or you'll piss on your 
                         feet. He who goes to bed with itchy 
                         bum wakes up with smelly finger.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Finally, the path to spiritual 
                         awakening requires the death of ego. 
                         Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the 
                         mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay 
                         Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

                                     DISCIPLES
                              (chanting)
                         Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu 
                         Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

               The Guru takes a swig of Yoo-Hoo.

                         Go with God, and pay at the door 
                         please.

               The disciples file out. Austin and Felicity approach.

                         Sorry?

                                     AUSTIN
                         My Willie don't work.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Why are you beating around the bush?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my problem.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Ohhhhh, I get it.
                              (beat)
                         No, I don't get it.

                         He's impotent!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, easy.
                              (to Guru)
                         Felicity and I were all set for some 
                         hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for 
                         six.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Oh, yes, I see.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You have no idea what I'm saying, do 
                         you?

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Not a word.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Guru, I've lost my mojo.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Oh, mojo! You should have said so. 
                         Well, you've lost your mojo because 
                         your chakras are misaligned. You 
                         have lost love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?

                                     FELICITY
                         Who's Vanessa?

                                     AUSTIN
                         She was an evil robot minion of Dr. 
                         Evil. I couldn't have loved her.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, 
                         buddy. You will only get your mojo 
                         back when you surround yourself with 
                         love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get what you're saying now! 
                         He's talking about free love, baby! 
                         Tune in, turn on, and drop out!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         I am talking about true love. You 
                         must stay and study until you are 
                         worthy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No way, man. The only way to surround 
                         yourself with love is to throw a 
                         swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!

               INT. DR.EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

               Dr. Evil and Frau are interrupted by the man we now know as 
               FAT BASTARD. He is foul-mouthed, and when he swears he is 
               bleeped.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have 
                         the mojo?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         First things first, where's your 
                         shitter? I've gotta bleepin, turtle 
                         head pokin' out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (disgusted)
                         Right. Charming. Fat Bastard- you 
                         don't mind me calling you Fat Bastard 
                         do you?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I've got a lot of demons kickin' 
                         around in my noggin, but weight issues 
                         ain't one of them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, Fatty-

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the 
                         incorrect weight for my height and I 
                         was born out of wedlock, hence the 
                         moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not 
                         kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck 
                         that could choke a donkey.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, the mojo?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Where's my (bleeping) money?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         A gentlemen never discusses money.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Fine, you can take your (bleep)in' 
                         money and shove it up your (bleep), 
                         you stupid (bleeping) prick! While 
                         you're at it you can suck my greasy, 
                         two-toned (bleep)!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pause)
                         Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         (Bleep) you!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Bring in the money.

               Dr. Evil PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS drive in a forklift loaded 
               with gold bars.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, here it is.

               Fat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of 
               MOJO.

               Dr. Evil is mesmerized.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, fetch.

               Mini-Me runs and snatches the mojo from Fat Bastard and gives 
               it to Dr. Evil, who caresses it and places it on a SPECIALLY 
               PREPARED PEDESTAL.

               NUMBER TWO enters.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I have some bad news. Austin 
                         Powers is back in the Sixties. One 
                         of our best assassins spotted him 
                         but he got away.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have 
                         his mojo.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         There is another. Felicity Shagwell, 
                         CIA.

               Suddenly, Scott Evil enters through TIME PORTAL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, what are you doing here?

                                     SCOTT
                         I don't know, I was sitting around 
                         watching the tube and The Courtship 
                         of Eddie's Father came on Nick at 
                         Nite, you know, and I was just 
                         listening to that theme song--
                              (hums/sings the theme)
                         Anyway it made me think that maybe 
                         we could try and work things out. 
                         You know, you are my Dad and I need 
                         you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You had your chance, Scott. I already 
                         have someone created in my image. 
                         He's evil, he wants to take over the 
                         world, and he fits easily into most 
                         overhead storage bins.
                              (looking around)
                         Has anyone seen Mini-Me?
                              (calling out)
                         Mini-Me! Mini-Mouse? Mini-Driver? 
                         Hello! Mini Pearl? Can we put a 
                         frickin' bell on him or something?

               Scott, very hurt, sits back in his chair and sulks. Dr. Evil 
               hits a button and a model moon and a model earth descend.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, phase three. We place a 
                         giant laser on the moon. Let me 
                         demonstrate.
                              (beat)
                         Where's my laser?

               Dr. Evil looks around and sees Mini-Me gnawing on the model 
               laser. Dr. Evil takes it from his mouth

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, don't chew my laser.
                              (to room)
                         Not feeling well. He has an ear 
                         infection, but tit's OK.
                              (pause)
                         No? Nothing?
                              (back to model)
                         Anyway, the laser is powerful enough 
                         to destroy every city on the planet 
                         at will. We'll turn the moon into 
                         what I like to call a "Death Star".

               Scott SNICKERS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What?

                                     SCOTT
                              (snickering again)
                         Nothing Darth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What did you call me?

                                     SCOTT
                         Nothing.
                              (pretends to sneeze)
                         Rip-off!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unsure)
                         Bless you? Anyways, since my "death 
                         star" laser was invented by the noted 
                         Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I 
                         thought we'd name it in his honor-- 
                         the Alan Parsons Project.

               Scott SNICKERS again.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What now?

                                     SCOTT
                         The Alan Parsons Project was a 
                         progressive rock band from 1982.  
                         Why don't you just name it Operation 
                         Wang Chung, ass?

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (indicating laser)
                         When you get your own evil empire, 
                         you can call it whatever you want.  
                         Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate 
                         the awesome lethality of the Alan 
                         Parsons Project. Fire the laser!

               INSERT SHOT:

               A giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the White 
               House, causing it to explode.

               Everyone is shocked by the laser's power.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My God, Dr. Evil, you destroyed the 
                         Wihite House with no warning!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, that was just footage from 
                         the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture 
                         Independence Day, but it would be a 
                         lot like that. What do you think, 
                         Scott?

                                     SCOTT
                         Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was 
                         really impressive.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shhhh!

                                     SCOTT
                         I'm nineteen, I don't-

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shh! Shh-Shh. Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh. Shh-
                         shh! It's Morse code.
                              (reading imaginary 
                              paper)
                         Let me decipher... it says 'shhhhh!'

                                     SCOTT
                         You are so lame-

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (like Electric Company)
                         Ssssss...huuuuuh...Shhhhh!

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, what are we going to do 
                         about Powers?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, in addition to being 
                         extremely rotund, you're a vicious 
                         killer.

               Take care of it.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It'll be my pleasure.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's an easy job. Without his mojo, 
                         Powers will be...powerless?

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

               A party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in 
               full swing. A girl dances in an oversized birdcage.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, 
                         baby, yeah!

               The party sequence is shot like Laugh-In. Very fast cuts to 
               the music.

               Austin sees a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN drinking a martini and 
               smoking.  He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from 
               her.

                                     PREGNANT WOMAN
                         Hey!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You'll thank me later, baby.

               Another angle. Austin and Felicity dancing.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (noticing someone)
                         Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?

               We see RICARDO MONTEBLAN -smoking a hukka on a round chair.

                                     RICARDO
                         Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen 
                         and the king laughed because he had 
                         too.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to camera)
                         Crazy, man!

                                     FELICITY
                         Let's split up and scope the scene.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at 
                         least not without me.

               Felicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to chick)
                         You're very exotic, baby. Do you 
                         have a little English in you?

                                     CHICK
                         No.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you like to?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An Alan Zeus-type very gay guy.

                              (rolling his eyes)
                         This is ridiculous!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A LONDON COP and Felicity are on hanging chairs.

                                     LONDON COP
                         Have you ever been picked up by the 
                         fuzz?

                                     FELICITY
                         No, but I bet it really hurts.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GUY IN A RAINCOAT on a tricycle, shot undercranked, rides 
               through the party and falls over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin pops into frame with a book that says "AUSTIN POWERS 
               SEXY DICTIONARY".

                                     AUSTIN
                         The Austin Powers Sexy Dictionary 
                         defines an Eskimo hooker as a frosty 
                         prosty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An eskimo at the bar in a fur parka.

                         I don't get it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The camera pans up Felicity's cool hip-huggers, which are 
               very tight.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Those are skin tight. How do you get 
                         into those pants, baby?

                                     FELICITY
                         Well you can start by buying me a 
                         drink.

               Austin does a spit take.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Felicity with a VIKING.

                         You were great last night. By the 
                         way, I'm Thor.

                                     FELICITY
                         You're Thor? I'm tho thor I can hardly

               Austin is wearing a silly spiked German helmet like in Hogan's 
               Heroes.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (German accent)
                         Hello, I am Baron Von Firstinbed. 
                         Last night I had German-Chinese food. 
                         An hour later I was hungry- for power.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         handful of F-off pills?

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Did you hear about the contortionist 
                         who was engaged to be married?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yeah, I heard she broke it off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Film running backwards of Austin doing a spit take.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Verrrrry interesting- but shtupid!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin takes his glasses off to clean them. We see his POV, 
               which is totally fuzzy. He looks over and sees what appears 
               to be a NUDE GIRL- two round globes and dark triangle.

               Austin puts his glasses on and looks again. It is actually a 
               girl in a flesh-colored dress. In between her and Austin 
               were two COMPLETELY BALD MEN and a triangular martini glass 
               filled with a Cosmopolitan.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Cut to Austin and Felicity together again.

                                     FELICITY
                         Look at that.

               She points to where Fat Bastard and his companion are 
               standing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not a pretty sight. Who is 
                         he?

                                     FELICITY
                         Until recently he worked security 
                         for the MOD, but we think he might 
                         be a double agent, possibly for Dr. 
                         Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How do you know?

                                     FELICITY
                         We've noticed that his lifestyle has 
                         changed dramatically. He's made a 
                         lot of cash purchases, he's hanging 
                         out with foxes half his age, and 
                         he's becomes quite a fixture on the 
                         London party circuit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who's the girl?

                                     FELICITY
                         I don't know, but it looks like he's 
                         splitting.

               Fat Bastard exits.

                                     FELICITY
                         I'll follow him. You see what you 
                         can get out of the girl. We'll 
                         rendezvous later.

               Felicity follows Fat Bastard out the door. Austin makes his 
               way over to the girl.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, hello.

                                     GIRL
                         Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who are you today, baby?

                                     GIRL
                         Robin. Robin Swallows.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Swallows? That's an interesting name. 
                         Are you English?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         German, actually. My maiden name is 
                         Spitz.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well which is it, baby, Spitz or 
                         Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         The pleasure is mine.

               She extends her hand. Austin takes it and shakes. As he 
               shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello. Austin is 
               transfixed and keeps shaking far too long.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Charmed, I'm sure.
                              (still shaking, her 
                              breasts jiggle)
                         How do you do?
                              (still shaking, 
                              jiggling)
                         Yes, quite.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I always enjoy meeting new people.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         How's your mum? Good.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I love shaking hands.

               Austin. is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in 
               danger of popping out of her dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (snapping out of it)
                         So, who was your friend?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         His name is Fat Bastard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It suits him.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         He's my lover.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         OK. Would you happen to know if he's 
                         in business with a man named Mr. 
                         Evil?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin 
                         does a smug take.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Something to drink? Would you like a 
                         Mister Pepper?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really? I said Mister Pepper.

               Austin does another smug take. Robin grabs Austin and pulls 
               him close.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         You're a groovy boy, I'd like to 
                         strap you on sometime.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               EXT. FISH AND CHIPS STAND - NIGHT

               Literally a window in a wall. Fat Bastard is placing his 
               order.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         ...and I'll have a fried-prawn 
                         sandwich, with extra mayonnaise, two 
                         whole chickens, a kidney pie, a toad 
                         in the hole, bubble and squeak, 
                         bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish 
                         and chips, and... a Fresca. No ice.

               We pan to see Felicity beside him.

                                     FELICITY
                         I love a man with a large appetite.

                         And I love a woman with big (bleeps), 
                         so let's shut up and get to
                         (bleep)ing.

               Felicity swallows hard and forces a smile.

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

                                     AUSTIN
                         Can I ask you a question?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you.

               Beat.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Well, what's the question?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes. Would you like to shag? 
                         Would you?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I'd love to, Mr. Powers, just come 
                         right... over... here.

               Robin moves Austin into place as they dance.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're a bit of alright.

               Just then, Austin looks into her eyes and sees the REFLECTION 
               OF AN ASSASSIN (Oedipus) about to throw a knife.

               Just as he throws it, Austin spins Robin Swallows around and 
               USES HER AS A SHIELD. She takes the knife squarely in the 
               back.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                              (strained)
                         Oedipus... use the revolver.

               Oedipus pulls out a pistol and begins FIRING. Austin continues 
               to use Robin AS A SHIELD. She takes six hits. Oedipus runs 
               out of bullets.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                              (strained)
                         Oedipus... use the machine gun.

               Oedipus pulls out a machine gun and FIRES. In a Robert 
               Rodriquez- like flurry of events, Austin dodges while still 
               USING HER AS A SHIELD.

               Oedipus throws down his gun and charges Austin. Austin uses 
               Robin's body to block Oedipus's head butt, but his momentum 
               pushes all three of them through a PLATE GLASS WINDOW of his 
               second story loft.

               IN MID-AIR

               As they fall, Austin turns Robin around so that she is between 
               him and the ground.

               EXT. OUTSIDE AUSTINIS FLAT

               They land with a THUD. Robin cushions Austin's fall. Oedipus 
               is dead on the pavement.

                         Oedipus, Oedipus...

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead 
                         as vaudeville.

                         You can't win, Powers. Dr. Evil has 
                         your mojo and it's only a matter of 
                         time before he kills you and takes 
                         over the world.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Felicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a 
               cigarette.  We hear strange sounds offstage.

               We pan over to reveal she's IN BED WITH A NAKED FAT BASTARD!

               He is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I always get (bleep)in' hungry after 
                         I get my end away!

                                     FELICITY
                         I never would have thought that a 
                         man of such tremendous girth could 
                         be such a, um, creative and sensuous 
                         lover!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         You want some chicken? I have more!

               He rolls over to reveal his HUGE NAKED ASS.

               Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around 
               for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage 
               and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to 
               go.

               ANGLE on FAT BASTARD'S face. He is delighted.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Frisky are we? Alright lets have 
                         another go!

               She is horrified.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

               Dr. Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two.

                         Not what I want Mr. President, but I 
                         will receive. In 12 hours I will 
                         destroy Washington, DC with a giant 
                         laser.

               Dr. Evil reveals a giant laser. Mini-Me is humping it like a 
               dog.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK, Mini-Me, why don't you and the 
                         laser get a frickin' room. Honestly.
                              (to President)
                         I will destroy another major city

                         That much money simply doesn't exist. 
                         I don't think l00 billion is even a 
                         number. It's like saying I want a 
                         kajillion bajillion dollars.

               Dr. Evil looks around smugly. No one laughs.

               Dr. Evil signs off.

                         I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding 
                         Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech, 
                         very touching.

               Scott looks at him with disgust.

                                     DR.EVIL
                         Okay, everybody clear the room!

               Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his 
               logo. He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal... A 
               SECRET SHRINE TO AUSTIN POWERS!

               In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and 
               various magazine covers.

               He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the 
               ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head. A backless mockup 
               of Austin's suit rises from the floor. He puts on a pair of 
               glasses. He has become Austin Powers.

               Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic.

                         This isn't working. I don't feel 
                         anything.

               We PUSH IN towards Dr. Evil's head.

               A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on 
               his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads 
               which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers 
               sprout the word "EVIL'.

               A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses 
               smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE" 
               and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".

               coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have 
               the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE" 
               flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns 
               into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
               stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of 
               urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred 
               Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says 
               "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream 
               that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

               FLASH CUT BACK TO:

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - AUSTIN SHRINE

               Pull back from Dr. Evil's head. He looks dazed and confused. 
               Just then, Number Two re-enters the room, catching Dr. Evil 
               with all his Austin paraphernalia.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, one last thing. I-- oh.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I was just... right. Would it kill 
                         you to frickin' knock?

               EXT./INT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin and Felicity walk along the street.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, tell me about the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You know I can't tell you details 
                         about the future, baby, it could 
                         alter history.

                                     FELICITY
                         Not details, just what it's like. 
                         You know, what's the scene?  Where's 
                         it at?

                                     AUSTIN
                         There've been a lot of advances in 
                         the Nineties, baby. The economy is 
                         stable, people take better care of 
                         their health concern for the 
                         environment is on the rise and, um, 
                         let's see, there's an entire 
                         television channel dedicated to golf.

                                     FELICITY
                         Sounds awful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's not so bad once you get used to 
                         it. The Nineties are about 
                         responsibility. You know, having 
                         respect for yourself and other people. 
                         I even got married.

                                     FELICITY
                         You? Married? What about the sexual 
                         revolution?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, it turns out there were some 
                         casualties, baby. Don't you think 
                         you'll ever get married?

                                     FELICITY
                         No, not until I get a little more 
                         'experience' under my belt.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand 
               to his mouth in fear.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wide-eyed)
                         Oh my God!

               Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun.

                                     FELICITY
                              (looking around)
                         What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, written here on my hand, see?

               Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh 
               my God' on his hand with the pen.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Says 'Oh my God!'

               They laugh.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, look.

               Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an 
               instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS.

               They run down the street filming each other.

               AUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE

               This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film 
               from Austin and Felicity's POVs.

               There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of 
               frame like the MONKEES TV show.

               BACK ON THE STREET

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I haven't had this much 
                         fun since I worked undercover in 
                         Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.

                                     FELICITY
                         1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch 
                         cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from 
                         poisoning the world's water supply.

               Austin is impressed.

                                     FELICITY
                         I've studied your file, Austin. I 
                         want to be a trailblazer, just like 
                         you.  The Seventies are right around 
                         the corner. It's going to be a 
                         glorious time for fashion and music 
                         and technology-- it won't be long 
                         before every flying car has its own 
                         8-track.

               Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue.

                                     FELICITY
                         The CIA has always been a boy's club 
                         until now. Well move over, this 
                         chick's taking over.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Very impressive.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, your voice!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I think I'm coming down with 
                         something.

               Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his 
               pushcart.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get some ice cream. Would you 
                         like some?

                                     FELICITY
                         No thanks.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse, to ice cream 
                              man)
                         Could I have two scoops of Vanilla, 
                         please?

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Right away, governor. Would you like 
                         chocolate syrup?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes, please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Will you have any whipped cream?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         I will, thank you.

                                     ICE CR@ MAN
                         Candy sprinkles?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Crushed nuts?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, laryngitis.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Here's your change, sir. Oh, and 
                         Austin--

               We cut back to the ICE CREAM MAN to see him pulling off a 
               very fake beard. It is BASIL (though it was clearly another 
               actor before).

                                     AUSTIN
                              (now with phlegmy 
                              throat)
                         Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Hello, Austin. What's wrong with 
                         your voice?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (still phlegmy throat)
                         I just had ice cream. Listen to me, 
                         I have dairy throat.  "Mary had a 
                         little lamb and it was always 
                         gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar 
                         gate and kicked it's little-

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (Interrupting)
                         Austin! Things are heating up, so I 
                         thought it best to contact you in 
                         disguise. Felicity, your plan worked. 
                         You and Austin track Fat Bastard 
                         back to Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But how can we track Fat Bastard?

                                     FELICITY
                         I planted a homing device on him 
                         last night.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Yes, and we're starting to pick up 
                         the signal now.

               Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that BEEPS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How did you get close enough to plant 
                         a homing device?

                                     FELICITY
                         I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.

               Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same 
               time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You... him? Just like that?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, Austin, we needed that 
                         information.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, 
                         we now know that-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         Did you use an elaborate set of 
                         pulleys? A block and tackle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Anyway, you two follow the signal 
                         back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and 
                         then-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         I just can't get my head around it, 
                         baby. You're so small and he's so 
                         ... not small. The sheer mechanics 
                         of it are mindboggling!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Never mind, Austin, you two have 
                         work to do. You must find Dr.  Evil.

               INT. BEETLE

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen built into the 
               dash.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got it! A Chinese basket with a 
                         counter-weighted ballast.  That's 
                         how you did it, right?

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, it almost sounds like you're 
                         jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who, me? That's not possible, baby!
                              (beat, to himself)
                         is it?

               Just then a-car pulls beside them. Two Dr. Evil Private Army 
               guys pull machine guns and start SHOOTING.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get down!

               Felicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS 
               from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD.

                                     FELICITY
                         We're obviously on the right track.
                              (re: tracking screen)
                         It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an 
                         island in the middle of the ocean.

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen.

               EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT

               The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach. 
               We still hear the BEEP-BEEP.

               EXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT

               Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the 
               Dr.  Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain 
               through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck.

                                     AUSTIN
                         According to the readings, Dr. Evil's 
                         headquarters is over the next ridge.

                                     FELICITY
                         Can I have a look?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is 
               still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.

                                     FELICITY
                         Question is, how do we get in?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (muffled)
                         Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, did you hear me?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I seem to be stuck in your dirty 
                         pillows.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where are the topographical maps 
                         that Basil drew up?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think they're in the tent.

               He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting 
               shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From 
               the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over 
               with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have 
               her hands up his butt.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Have you got it out yet?

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things 
                         do you put in there?

               The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage 
               links from his ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, anything that catches my fancy.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         How do you manage to fit it all in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, it stretches to fit.

               The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of 
               Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Are you almost done? I can't hold it 
                         much longer.

               INT. TENT

               We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent.

               Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent.

                                     FELICITY
                         Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing 
                         how much this duffel bag will hold.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

               We see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on 
               top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (singing)
                         'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US?
                         JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?'

               We see that Number Two and Frau are the audience. They 
               applaud.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I 
                         do have some bad news.  Powers' is 
                         on the island.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How tedious.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to 
                         him by using the girl.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I have the perfect weapon. Frau?

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Bring in the He-Bots!

               MUSIC: It's Rainina Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Three HE-BOTS 
               enter in unison. They are robotic studs in Logan's Run type 
               outfits.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots. 
                         What kind of woman could resist these 
                         perfect specimens of masculinity? 
                         Their clothes are stylish, their 
                         posture is ramrod straight, and their 
                         buttocks are tight, like tigers. 
                         And, each He-Bot is armed with a 
                         secret weapon.

               ANGLE ON THE FIRST HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours 
               out.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Poison gas...

               ANGLE ON THE SECOND HE-BOT.

               A gun barrel flips out form his crotch and FIRES machine-gun 
               style.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Machine gun...

               ANGLE ON THE THIRD HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles 
               out onto the floor, where it smokes.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         And deadly acid.

               Dr. Evil is disgusted by the last one.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. I object to the last one on 
                         aesthetic grounds, but I don't care 
                         how you get Powers, just bring him 
                         to me.
                              (to Mini-Me)
                         Ready Mini-Me? A one and a two and...
                              (singing)
                         ME, AND MY SHA-DOW STROLLING DOWN 
                         THE A-VA-
                              (rapidly)
                         WASN'T A STREET, WASN'T A ROAD
                         WASN'T A BOULEVARD
                              (dancing in step)
                         ME, AND MY SHA- OW ALL ALONE AND FEE-
                         LING...

                                     MINI-ME
                              (voice unnaturally 
                              low)
                         BLUE!

               EXT. TENT

               We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is 
               putting things into Austin's ass.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Do you want everything to go back 
                         in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat 
                         Bastard-

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         It's my job, Austin. You of all people 
                         should understand that.  Marakesh, 
                         1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I 
                         know your record backwards and 
                         forwards.  You've had more sex on 
                         the job than a Swedish stewardess.

               The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into 
               what appears to be Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         You're right, Felicity, I can't deny 
                         it. But the world changed, and I 
                         changed too.

               Pull back to reveal that THE HE-BOTS are watching. Felicity 
               shoves the tennis racket extra hard.

               Austin stands up rapidly.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Ow!
                              (beat)
                         My back hurts.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Are you OK?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         I'm fine, just keeping packing.

               The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - 60'S

               Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Christ Almighty, it smells terrible 
                         in here.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's the volcanic sulphurous 
                         emissions. We've put up some air 
                         fresheners.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Great, now it smells like someone 
                         took a shite in a pine tree.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded 
                         into the rocket. You're ready for 
                         launch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. 
                         I have so few pleasures, you know.

               Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private 
               Army Men.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome 
                         to my hollowed-out volcano.

                                     AUSTIN
                         We meet again, Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you 
                         alive is so you can feel the agony 
                         of watching my plan unfold.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil your plan will never--

               Austin trails off as he spots his MOJO in the beaker behind 
               Dr.  Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh, is that yours?

                                     AUSTIN
                         My mojo!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You know what they say: finders 
                         keepers, loser weepers.

                                     FELICITY
                         Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course. Why?

               Felicity kicks Dr. Evil in the balls.

                                     FELICITY
                         Now you've got a couple of achers.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oww! My stomach hurts!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wincing)
                         I don't care if he is evil, you don't 
                         give a man a shot in the pills. It's 
                         just not cricket, baby.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Take them away.

               The guards lead Austin and Felicity away.

                                     SCOTT
                         She just hoofed you in the sack and 
                         you're going to leave them alone in 
                         a jail cell with one inept guard? 
                         They'll escape, dipshit. You do this

                         It's complicated. Usually it's illegal

                         digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving 
                         you in charge. I'm going up the moon 
                         to hold the world ransom with my

               part of the rocket. Steam begins billowing, etc.

                         How are we going to get out of here?

                         Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard 
                         again?

                         Austin, that is it! I don't know 
                         what happened to you in the Nineties, 
                         but I'm still here, in the Sixties, 
                         and I still swing! Don't try to lay 
                         your hang-ups on me just because you 
                         lost your mojo! That one hurts.

                         Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.

                         I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap 
                         shot.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, baby, you're right. I was wrong 
                         to judge you. I guess I am... jealous.

                         But the Austin Powers I knew was 
                         wild and crazy and free. He could 
                         never be jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That Austin is gone. I've changed. I 
                         knew someone, not long ago, a very 
                         special woman. She taught me that 
                         life isn't about jumping into the 
                         sack with whoever comes along, it's 
                         about caring and responsibility. And 
                         while it is true she turned out to 
                         be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, 
                         I suppose I really did... love her.

                         Was that your wife?

                         Yes, Vanessa.

               Felicity is touched.

                                     FELICITY
                         Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to 
                         understand everything you've gone 
                         through, but I trust you. I'll make 
                         you a deal: if we get out of here 
                         alive, I'll give monogamy a try.

                         We need to lure the guard inside and

                         Alright, what if I pretend to be 
                         desperately ill with food poisoning? 
                         The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, 
                         will come to investigate.  Meanwhile, 
                         you dig a pit and line it with 
                         makeshift punji sticks made from 
                         sharpened toothbrushes. The guard 
                         falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've 
                         got the key.  What do you think?

                         That might work, but how about this?

               Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping 
               open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard. 
               We, however, can't see them.

               The guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin 
               is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce.

                         think?

               The guard follows her into the cell.

               The guard advances on her.

               She PUNCHES the guard right in the face and he collapses.

                         Almost... got it!

               Austin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up.

               dark and quiet.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where's your mojo, Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm not sure.

               MUSIC: It's Raining Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Suddenly, the 
               lights dim. The three He-Bots descend from the ceiling on 
               trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Watch out, baby, He-Bots!

               The He-Bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison, like 
               a perfect Olympic dismount. Their crotch nozzles flip up one 
               by one.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't fight them without my mojo.

                                     FELICITY
                         Who said anything about fighting?

               MUSIC: seductive music Felicity does a very seductive dance, 
               with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds. The He-Bots EXPLODE, 
               succumbing to her mojo.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing, Felicity, you were making 
                         me very horny, man! Extremely randy, 
                         indeed!

                                     FAT BASTARD (O.S.)
                         C'mon, give the lads a show. Take of 
                         your top. Put 'em on the glass! Make 
                         'em bounce. Let's have a look at 
                         your tits.

               Austin and Felicity turn to see Fat Bastard lurking in the 
               background.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Looking for this, Mr. Powers?

               Fat Bastard, holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen 
               private army men.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I give the orders, (bleep) for brains. 
                         Guards, take them back to their cells.

               Guards approach.

                                     FELICITY
                         Hold on, let me ask you one question.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, I guess I owe you that much 
                         for a night of carnal ecstasy.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         What kind of stupid ass question is 
                         that? I'm (bleep)in' rich and I'm up 
                         to my tits in clean stinky.

                                     FELICITY
                         You didn't answer my question, are 
                         you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I 
                         could lose a few pounds, but I could 
                         shiva git!

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, 
                         I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger 
                         titties than you do! I've got more 
                         (bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone 
                         book.  I've got more crack cheese 
                         than a (bleep)in' dairy. I've nay 
                         seen ma willie in two years. That's 
                         enough time to declare it legally 
                         deed! I can't stop eating. I eat 
                         because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy 
                         because I eat.
                              (starts to cry)
                         I'm caught in a cycle and there's no 
                         escape!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's 
                         a thin bastard, trying to get out

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Maybe there's big crap inside me 
                         trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough 
                         of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms. 
                         Listen, I've run the gamut of self- 
                         help books.  "Food isn't love", right, 
                         but how do you get it from the page 
                         to the (bleep)in' fork?  I'm so weak, 
                         I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, 
                         take the mojo.

               Fat Bastard hands over the mojo.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I appreciate you trying to reach me, 
                         no one can do it for me, I know this 
                         now.  There's a hole in my soul that 
                         food won't fill. This is the beginning 
                         of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym 
                         everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's 
                         someone I have to get in touch with 
                         and forgive... myself.
                              (pause)
                         Sorry. I farted.
                              (pause)
                         It's a long road ahead.

               EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - DAY

               Austin and Felicity run up to the Beetle.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on, I have something very 
                         important to do.

               Austin drinks the mojo.

                                     FELICITY
                         How do you feel?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sound as a pound, my spuds are 
                         boiling. Fancy a shag?

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, we don't have time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good 
                         foot and do the bad thing!

                         Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the 
                         moon. The world is in danger.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Right, the moon. I think I know 
                         someone who can give us a lift.

                         There's been some sort of delay in 
                         the launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but 
                         we understand that America's first 
                         manned mission to the moon will be 
                         blasting off shortly.

               INT. CAPSULE

               Pan across Austin in a spacesuit, then Felicity in her 
               spacesuit, then CAMEO ASTRONAUT in his space suit. They are 
               surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket 
                         scientist to figure this stuff out.

                                     ASTRONAUT
                         I am a rocket scientist.

               A technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins.

                                     MISSION COMMANDER (V.O.)
                         We will have lift-off in T minus 10 
                         seconds... 9... 8... etc.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, if you get frightened, 
                         just hold my hand.

               EXT. CAPE CANAVERAL (STOCK FOOTAGE)

               The rocket lifts off.

                                     MISSION COMMANDER (V.O.)
                         We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has 
                         cleared the tower and is heading for 
                         a rendezvous with the moon.

               INT. APOLLO CAPSULE

               The G-forces during lift-off are incredible. Austin's face 
               is pulled into a contorted mask which bares his teeth. His 
               hair sticks straight up and his glasses are twisted.

               Austin is terrified. He clutches Felicity's hand, then grabs 
               on to the astronaut beside him.

               Felicity, however, loves it.

                                     FELICITY

                         To be honest it was terrifying. It 
                         felt like sitting on top of a bomb. 
                         As I punched through the atmosphere, 
                         I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled 
                         myself.

                         No, I mean I soiled myself just now 
                         when I said oh 'my God!'

                         This is one small step for man, but 
                         a giant step for shagging.  Can you 
                         imagine it, baby, weightless? The

               Dr. Evil walks all the way around a TUBULAR HALLWAY-- up the 
               walls, across the ceiling upside down, and back again, 
               settling into his chair. It is like that shot in 2001 SPACE

                         WARNING, LASER CALIBRATION!

               The ALARM continues to blare.

               INT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN)

               The President at his desk.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         What? I can't hear you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Pay me 100 billion dollars or see 
                         Washington DC destroyed!

               The ALARM BLARES.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         I'm sorry, I just can't hear you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (louder)
                         How about now?

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Better.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         The Capital will be destroyed-

               The ALARM BLARES.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Sorry! I just can't- I think it's 
                         that alarm.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Could someone shut off that frickin' 
                         alarm? I'm trying to hold the free 
                         world hostage here. Honestly.
                              (shouting)
                         WILL DESTROY WASHINGTON DC UNLESS 
                         YOU PAY ME-

               The ALARM SHUTS OFF but Dr. Evil is still shouting.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (shouting)
                         100 BILLION DOLLARS!

               His yelling startles even himself.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Please Dr. Evil, be reasonable. That's 
                         more money than is in the entire 
                         Federal Treasury!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh well, I guess you have one minute 
                         to- "show me the money"!

                                     PRESIDENT
                         I still don't know what that means. 
                         I can't show you the money because 
                         we don't have the money.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Then I suppose you're up shit's crick 
                         without a paddle.

               INT. NASA CONTROL ROOM

               A white room with a bank of old-fashioned computers and a 
               tracking screen. Basil, several GENERALS, and other VIPs 
               look anxiously over the shoulder of the MISSION CONTROL 
               SPECIALISTS.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the 
                         moon. We'll soon know whether he has 
                         succeeded or whether the world will 
                         be destroyed!

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - HALLWAY

               Austin and Felicity enter through a hatch and step out of 
               their spacesuits.

                                     FELICITY
                         Let's find Dr. Evil.

               Suddenly, Austin notices something.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shhh...

               He points. We see a profile through a sheet of frosted glass. 
               It is Dr. Evil's distinctive profile, with a machine gun. 
               Austin takes careful aim and FIRES.  We see the SHADOW take 
               the hit, and fall.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, you've done it! You got Dr. 
                         Evil!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course I did, baby, I got my mojo 
                         working overtime.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, I'm going ahead. Cover my 
                         rear!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Felicity runs ahead. Austin runs over to where the shadow 
               came from. He sees that it was not Dr. Evil, but MINI-ME, 
               carrying a little gun. Austin is ashamed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger. He's so small, 
                         he's like a dog or something.

               Austin chokes back a tear.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger.
                              (realizing)
                         Felicity, be careful! Dr. Evil is 
                         still alive! Felicity?

               Austin runs after her.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

               Austin rounds the corner and comes upon Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (holding his gun on 
                              Dr. Evil)
                         Alright, slap-head, turn around. 
                         Slowly.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Aren't you forgetting something?

               A wall panel in the main chamber revolves, revealing FELICITY, 
               enclosed in a glass tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!
                              (to Dr. Evil)
                         What have you done to her?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't worry, she's not dead... yet.

               Brightly colored GAS starts to fill the glass chamber.

                                     FELICITY
                              (muffled through glass)
                         Don't worry about me Austin. You've 
                         got to save the world!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice, 
                         Powers: save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

               Austin is torn. He looks back and forth between Felicity and 
               the laser which is on the other side of the room.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got my mojo back, man, I can do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         We'll see. Fire the laser!

               The woman manning the laser's joystick begins to MOVE IT. 
               Austin leaps across the room and reaches her just in time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hands off my joystick, baby.

               He wrestles with her a moment and then KNOCKS IT ASKEW.

               EXT. SPACE

               The laser beam hits the Big Boy Rocket in the crotch and Big 
               Boy's eyes cross in pain.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Damn you, Powers!

               Dr. Evil hits a SELF-DESTRUCT button. An ALARM blares.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Warning! Self-destruct sequence 
                         initiated!

               The base is rocked by EXPLOSIONS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Perhaps you spoke too soon.

               Austin looks over. Felicity has slumped over in the tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Noooooo!

               Austin BANGS on the glass with his fists.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake 
                         up! Please God, don't take her away.

               It is too late. Dr. Evil runs through the TIME PORTAL and 
               gets away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, you have to understand, I 
                         thought I had my mojo back.  This 
                         isn't fair.

               Austin looks up to the heavens. We see a quick--

               FLASHBACK - MONTAGE

               of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first 
               kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self.

               A tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against 
               the glass as if trying to reach her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love you, Felicity! I know I 
                         couldn't say it before, but I really 
                         do love you!
                              (enraged)
                         Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!

               Austin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block 
               his path. Austin is like an animal.

               He charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and 
               takes a bite out of it.

               Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE 
               OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground.

               The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists 
               simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE 
               A PUMPKIN.

               Austin runs over to the TIME PORTAL set for "75 BC". He runs 
               through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROMAN VILLA - 75 BC

               An orgy is taking place. Dr. Evil is in a toga with a laurel 
               with two YOUNG ROMAN MEN feeding him grapes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You make love to your wife out of 
                         duty, your mistress for pleasure, 
                         and a Roman boy for ecstasy.
                              (noticing Austin)
                         Shit.

               He runs away as Austin appears through the TIME PORTAL. Austin 
               follows Dr. Evil into another TIME PORTAL marked "1975".

               EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD -

               Austin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting 
               into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO 
               with a white stripe pulls over.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I have to commandeer this vehicle.
                              (noticing)
                         Hey, aren't you Hutch?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

               We see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY).

                                     PAUL MICHAEL GLASER
                         I'm Starsky.

                                     DAVID SOUL
                         I'm Hutch.

               Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car 
               disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino 
               follows.

               A sign at the car wash reads: "1911"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DECK OF THE TITANIC -

               Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic" 
               stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with 
               Austin hot on his heels.

                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                         Iceberg, dead ahead!

               Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, 
               KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by.

                                     JAMES CAMERON
                         I'm king of the world!

               Dr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL 
               they just came from.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY -

               Dr. Evil runs into the street with Austin chasing him. In 
               SLO-MO Austin dives for a ridiculously long time, and TACKLES 
               Dr.  Evil, pinning him.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (breathing heavily)
                         Before you do that, know this: Austin, 
                         I am... your... father.

               MUSIC: DRAMATIC STING

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really?

                         No. I can't back that up. I was just 
                         grasping at straws. I had nothing. 
                         But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers, 
                         you really have become a product of 
                         the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How so?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You're more interested in your job 
                         as glorified policeman than you are 
                         in love. You won the battle, but I 
                         won the war. Love means nothing, 
                         you've proved it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't think that Felicity was 
                         going to die, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What a cowardly response. I'm 
                         disappointed really. You have the 
                         power to go back in time and save 
                         her, but it means letting me go.

               Austin looks over and sees a TIME PORTAL. Through it he can 
               glimpse the lair, and Felicity.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going 
                         to be? Me or the girl?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!

               Austin runs through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - 60'S

               We see the scene from a moment ago. Felicity is in the glass 
               tube and the BRIGHTLY COLORED GAS is starting to fill it.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice: 
                         save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I choose love, baby.

               Austin runs over to the glass tube and SMASHES HIS FIST 
               through it. The glass SHATTERS and Austin pulls Felicity 
               out. She gasps for air.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I love you.

                         That was another place and another 
                         time, baby.

               Austin kisses her for a long time. She starts to twitch.

               She struggles. She hits him in the head and he finally stops 
               kissing her.

                                     FELICITY
                              (gasping)
                         Can't. Breathe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry, baby, I got a little over- 
                         stimulated.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fire the laser!

                                     AUSTIN
                         What do we do?

                                     FELICITY
                         Use your mojo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         I don't have it!

                                     FELICITY
                         Trust me, you do!

               Austin turns and gives a 'who me?' look over his bottom. The 
               woman arming the laser stumbles backwards into the directional 
               control just as it FIRES.

               The Big Boy Rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes 
               harmlessly by.

               They embrace.

                         Austin, you had it all along. No one

                     Sooner or later though, you always have
                     to wake up...
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. CITY - NIGHT
          
          A SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing --
          
          JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a
          beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are
          hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured
          pain beyond his years.
          
          Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS
          WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish
          advertizing.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                     They can fix a spinal, if you've got the
                     money. But not on vet benefits, not in
                     this economy.
          
          The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the
          crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people
          wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a
          LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous,
          isolated souls.
          
          INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          The room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom.
          Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. --
          
                               PERKY NEWSCASTER
                     The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a
                     century, is making a comeback. These
                     cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
                     are...
          
                                                                       2.
          
          
          
          Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side,
          pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the
          other, and so on.
          
          His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his
          arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A "Born Loser"
          tattoo prominent on his shoulder.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I became a Marine for the hardship. To
                    be hammered on the anvil of life. I told
                    myself I could pass any test a man can
                    pass.
          
          Jake struggles with his pants a long time.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT
          
          Not the kind of place you'd bring your mom.
          
          We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front
          wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his
          forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets,
          CLAP and WHOOP.
          
          Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer.
          
          A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men
          RUNNING on antelope legs.
          
          CU JAKE, watching what he can't have.    Expression stony.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Let's get it straight up front. I don't
                    want your pity. I know the world's a
                    cold-ass bitch.
          
          Jake's eyes shift   -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in
          the crowd. A MAN    on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he's with.
          Hard. She cowers    but he's got her arm, shouting, raising his
          fist. An eternal    tableau. People look away.
          
          CU JAKE -- not looking away.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong
                    planet. The strong prey on the weak.
          
          TIGHT ON JAKE'S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his
          chair.
          
          TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward.
          
                                                                        3.
          
          
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's just the way things are.   And nobody
                    does a damn thing.
          
          Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans
          down and grabs one leg of the man's barstool -- and YANKS.
          
          The chair flips.   The guy goes down HARD and --
          
          JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy,
          getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap
          out of him, right there on the floor.
          
          THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into
          SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling...
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
                    was a single thing worth fighting for.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT
          
          THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on
          the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him,
          banging across the alley, landing in the trash.
          
          Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. He's bleeding and
          bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.
          
                              JAKE
                    I hope you realize you've just lost a
                    customer!
          
          He collapses onto his back, panting.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to himself)
                    Candy ass bitch.
          
          He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR
          overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking --
          then shouts jauntily to no one in particular --
          
                              JAKE
                    If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled
          amongst the trash, getting drenched.
          
          TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him.
          
                                                                       4.
          
          
          
          Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.   He
          squints up at --
          
          TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and
          blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.
          
                              AGENT 1
                    Are you Jake Sully?
          
                                JAKE
                    Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood.
          
                              AGENT 2
                    It's about your brother.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT
          
          DOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER
          FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN'S FACE. He
          looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His
          IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The strong prey on the weak. A guy with
                    a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for
                    the paper in his wallet.
          
          WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech
          CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake
          stares down at his own face.
          
                              JAKE
                    Jesus, Tommy.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The Suits' concern was touching.
          
                              AGENT 1
                    Your brother represented a significant
                    investment. We'd like to talk to you
                    about taking over his contract.
          
          The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape
          dispenser, like it's a package for shipping. The cardboard
          coffin is rolled into the furnace.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The egghead and the jarhead.   Tommy was
                    the scientist, not me. He was the one
                    who wanted to get shot light years out
                    into space to find the answers.
          
                                                                       5.
          
          
          
          PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Me -- I was just another dumb grunt
                    gettin' sent someplace I was gonna
                    regret.
          
          INSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the
          cardboard; TOMMY'S FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame
          but not touched by it, as we --
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          JAKE'S FACE, in icy darkness. CLOSE ON his eyes -- they OPEN
          suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- the inside of a metal coffin. A SERVO WHINE
          and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber --
          
          INT. CRYO VAULT
          
          JAKE'S POV -- A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY
          toward us. Wherever we are, we're not on Earth.
          
          Jake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing --
          
          WIDE SHOT -- the multi-tiered CRYO VAULT. Hundreds of CRYO-
          CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull
          themselves about in ZERO-G, tending to their patients.
          
                              JAKE
                        (a hoarse whisper)
                    Are we there?
          
                              MED TECH
                    We're there, Sunshine.
          
          TIME CUT -- SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryo-capsules
          in ZERO-G. Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open
          coffins.
          
          The MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice.
          
                              MED TECH
                    People, you have been in cryo for five
                    years, nine months and twenty two days.
                    You will be hungry, you will be weak. If
                    you feel nausea, please use the sacks
                    provided for your convenience. The staff
                    thanks you in advance.
          
                                                                        6.
          
          
          
          FOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to
          the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an
          impediment in weightlessness.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SPACE
          
          Against the cold infinity   of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR
          SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE   STAR. As it moves past like an
          endless train, we realize   this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half
          a mile long. PAN WITH IT    180 to REVEAL --
          
          A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of
          moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face.
          
          The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a
          blue and surprisingly Earth-like world called PANDORA. The
          ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. PANDORA ORBIT
          
          ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the
          sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora.
          
          CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive "VALKYRIE" SHUTTLES are mated to
          a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and
          moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts.
          
          As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear
          the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we--
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - TWILIGHT
          
          FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas
          carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around
          the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding.
          
          The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are
          waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.
          
          Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to --
          
          AN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookie-
          cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the
          terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story
          buildings.
          
          And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --
          
                                                                       7.
          
          
          
          EXT. HELL'S GATE - TWILIGHT
          
          HELL'S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel
          structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high,
          topped with razor wire.
          
          At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS
          swiveling on servo mounts.
          
          Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in
          across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle,
          bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.
          
          EXT. RAIN FOREST - TWILIGHT
          
          Through a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE
          thunder overhead. Camera TILTS with it until leaves block
          the view.
          
          A BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to
          reveal the shuttle hover-taxiing across the compound.
          
          REVERSE -- ECU of two intense, cat-like golden EYES watching.
          
          INT./EXT. SHUTTLE
          
          The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling --
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Exopacks on!
          
          Passengers don their EXO-PACK breathing gear with practiced
          moves. Everybody except JAKE, who's turning his this way and
          that trying to figure out the straps.
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Remember people, you lose your mask
                    you're unconscious in 20 seconds and
                    you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody
                    be dead today, it looks bad on my report.
          
          The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark --
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Exopack on, let's go!
          
          BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter
          radius as it settles onto its landing gear.
          
          INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles
          ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks --
          and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the
          level of everyone else's WAISTS.
          
                                                                        8.
          
          
          
          THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine.
          
                              CREW CHIEF
                    Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
                    Go straight inside!
          
          HAND-HELD, running with the arriving colonists who double
          time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward
          a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex.
          
          Inside the chain-link tunnel are a couple of SEC-OPS
          TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. Sec-Ops
          is the colony's private security force. These guys are laid
          back, hardened, and haggard.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Look at all that new meat.
          
          THEIR POV -- Jake rolls down the ramp.
          
                              FIKE
                    Check it out, man.    Meals on wheels.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    That is just wrong.
          
          Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as --
          
          A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy
          wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires --
          ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the
          advanced technology.
          
          Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and
          heavily armed, they are AT-99 "SCORPION" GUNSHIPS.
          
          MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4
          meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily
          armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
          
          Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds
          of feet high.   A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS
          light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off
          the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege.
          
          WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball
          as he approaches.
          
                              JAKE
                    What're you two limpdicks starin' at?
          
          As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and --
          
                                                                          9.
          
          
          
          K-KRASH! SMASHES against the chain-link right next to his
          head.
          
          A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs
          against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link
          with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT.
          
          WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL.   It drops off
          the fence, tail still lashing.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
                    wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up
                    in one.
          
          Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien.
          
          ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED
          FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair
          through the tunnel below.
          
          The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long
          parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizen's claws raked
          across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem
          hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Criss-crossed by scars.
          
          The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky.    He eyes
          are an icy steel gray.
          
          HIS POV -- the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky,
          beyond the clouds.
          
                              MAN (V.O.)
                    You are not in Kansas any more...
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - TWILIGHT
          
          THE MAN from the balcony -- COLONEL MILES QUARITCH -- is the
          HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hell's Gate colony. A hundred new
          arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the
          front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide.
          
          Without his mask, we see that Quaritch's features are rugged
          and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to
          jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very
          large PISTOL.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    ... You are on Pandora, ladies and
                    gentlemen. Respect that fact every second
                    of every day.
          
                                                                       10.
          
          
          
          JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back.
          
          COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window,
          toward the dark treeline.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Out beyond that fence every living thing
                    that crawls, flies or squats in the mud
                    wants to kill you and eat your eyes for
                    jujubees.
          
          The room gets very quiet.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    We have an indigenous population of
                    humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're
                    fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin
                    which can stop your heart in one minute.
                    We operate -- we live -- at a constant
                    threat condition yellow.
          
          PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Cat-machine drivers,
          engineers, geologists, as they take that in.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    As head of security, it's my job to keep
                    you alive.    I will not succeed --
                        (pausing for effect)
                    -- not with all of you. If you wish to
                    survive, you need a strong mental
                    attitude, you need to follow procedure...
          
          PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Nothing like an old-school safety brief
                    to put your mind at ease.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          People are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms,
          lugging duffels and cases.
          
          An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an
          overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake.
          
                              NORM
                    Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother?
                    You look just like him.
                        (off Jake's wary look)
                    Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through
                    avatar training with him.
          
                                                                         11.
          
          
          
          Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it.
          
                              NORM
                    He was a great guy -- funny.     It was a
                    big shock to all of us.
          
                               JAKE
                    Yeah.
          
          Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on.       Norm walks
          with him.
          
                              NORM
                    And duh! -- obviously you look like him.
                    I mean, if you weren't genetically
                    identical, you wouldn't be taking over
                    his avatar.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's why I'm here.
          
                              NORM
                    So -- you want to go check it out?
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          INT. BIO-LAB - DAY
          
          JAKE AND NORM enter the BIO-LAB -- a large lab complex with
          many adjoining rooms.
          
                              MAX
                    Me and Norm were out here to drive these
                    remotely controlled bodies called
                    avatars. They're grown from human DNA
                    mixed with DNA from the natives here.
          
          A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the
          uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the
          sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK.
          
          Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by
          some unseen force, toward --
          
          THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside,
          which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man.
          
          Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the
          abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see
          that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long
          black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.
          
                               JAKE
                    Damn.   They got big.
          
                                                                       12.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah, they mature on the trip out.
                        (to Max)
                    So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty
                    well.
          
                              MAX
                    Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give
                    us a few hours, you guys can take them
                    for a spin.
          
          THE FIGURE'S sleeping face turns toward us, and the features
          are -- despite feline ears and a long feral snout --
          definitely JAKE'S.
          
                              JAKE
                    It looks like him.
          
                              NORM
                    No, it looks like you.   This is your
                    avatar now, Jake.
          
          ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    The idea is -- every driver is matched to
                    his own avatar --
          
          STEREOCAM VIDEO SHOT OF JAKE -- facing the camera, talking
          directly to the lens. JAKE'S VOICE-OVER up until now has
          been part of this VIDEOLOG.
          
                               JAKE
                    -- so their nervous systems are in tune.
                    Or something. Which is why they offered
                    me this gig, because I can link with
                    Tommy's avatar, which was insanely
                    expensive.
                        (looking off camera)
                    Is this right? I just say whatever in
                    these videologs?
          
          WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max.
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah. You just need to get in the habit
                    of documenting everything -- what you
                    see, what you feel -- it's all part of
                    the science. Good science starts with
                    good observation.
          
                                                                     13.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    Right.
                        (to camera)
                    So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.
                        (looks around)
                    Never been in a lab before.
          
                              MAX
                    Log off. It's time to meet your boss for
                    the next five years.
          
          He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the --

                    Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the
                    head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote
                    the book -- I mean literally wrote the

                        (low, over his shoulder)
                    That's because she likes plants better
                    than people.

                    Who's got my goddamn cigarette?!
          
          A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit.   Around here
          they jump when Grace barks.
          
          Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach.
          
                              MAX
                    And here she is, Cinderella back from the
                    ball. Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm
                    Spellman and Ja --
          
                              GRACE
                    Norm. I hear good things about you.
                    How's your Na'vi?
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                        (Na'vi, subtitled)
                    May the All Mother smile upon our first
                    meeting.
          
          Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette.
          
                              GRACE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Not bad. You sound a little formal.
          
                              NORM
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    There is still much to learn.
          
          Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na'vi.
          
                              MAX
                    Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----
          
                              GRACE
                        (turning to Jake)
                    Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I
                    don't need you. I need your brother.
                        (to Max)
                    You know -- the PhD who trained three
                    years for this mission.
          
                              JAKE
                    He's dead. I know it's a big
                    inconvenience to everyone.
          
                              GRACE
                    How much lab training have you had?   Ever
                    run a gas chromatograph?
          
                                 JAKE
                    No.
          
                              GRACE
                    Any actual lab work at all?
          
                              JAKE
                    High school chemistry.   But I ditched.
          
          Grace wheels on Max.
          
                              GRACE
                    You see? You see? They're pissing on us
                    without even the courtesy of calling it
                    rain.
                        (turning away)
                    I'm going to Selfridge.
          
                                                                     15.
          
          
          
          She shoves past Jake.
          
                              MAX
                    Grace, that's not a good idea.
          
          But she's already out the door and clomping down the
          corridor. Max turns to Jake with a pained look.
          
                              MAX
                    Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.   Try to
                    use big words.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DUSK
          
          It looks like an air-traffic control tower, with lots of
          screens and bay windows showing the whole complex.
          
          ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly
          opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge
          is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless.
          
          He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a
          practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as
          Grace strides toward him.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, I used to think it was benign
                    neglect, but now I see you're
                    intentionally screwing us.
          
                               SELFRIDGE
                    Grace.   You know I enjoy our little
                    talks.
          
                              GRACE
                    I need a research assistant, not some
                    jarhead dropout.
          
          Selfridge looks down and hits the ball.
          
          Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past.
          Selfridge looks at her with a sigh.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Actually, we got lucky with him.
          
                               GRACE
                    Lucky?   How is this in any way lucky?
          
          As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball --
          
                                                                    16.
          
          
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Well -- lucky your guy had a twin
                    brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an
                    oral hygienist or something. A Marine we
                    can use. I'm assigning him to your team
                    as security escort.
          
                              GRACE
                    The last thing I need is another trigger
                    happy asshole out there!
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Look, you're supposed to be winning the
                    hearts and minds of the natives. Isn't
                    that the whole point of your little
                    puppet show? If you look like them, if
                    you talk like them, they'll trust you?
          
          Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby.
          Grace follows.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    But after -- how many years? -- relations
                    with the indigenous are only getting
                    worse.
          
                              GRACE
                    That tends to happen when you use machine
                    guns on them.
          
          On Selfridge's desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid-
          air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK.
          Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb
          and forefinger, in front of Grace's eyes.
          
                               SELFRIDGE
                    This is why we're here. Unobtanium.
                    Because this little gray rock sells for
                    twenty million a kilo. No other reason.
                    This is what pays for the party. And
                    it's what pays for your science.
                    Comprendo?
          
          He places it back in the magnetic field.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Those savages are threatening our whole
                    operation. We're on the brink of war and
                    you're supposed to be finding a
                    diplomatic solution. So use what you've
                    got and get me some results.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                         17.
          
          
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - DAY
          
          NEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units.
          
          Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining
          chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKE'S AVATAR lies on a gurney,
          breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORM'S AVATAR is on a
          second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exo-masks.
          
          Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric
          sensors.
          
                              GRACE
                    How much link time have you logged?
          
                              NORM
                    Five hundred and twenty hours.
          
          Grace looks pointedly at Jake.
          
                              JAKE
                    Like -- an hour.
          
                              GRACE
                    Tell me you're joking.
          
          Grace opens the hood of Jake's link unit. Jake starts
          hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to
          help him but --
          
                               JAKE
                    Don't!   I got this.
          
          Grace steps back, hands raised.    He drags himself into the
          unit.
          
                               GRACE
                    So you just figured you'd come out here
                    to the most hostile environment known to
                    man, with no training of any kind, and
                    see how it went? What was going through
                    your head?
          
          He meets her eyes with a defiant glare.
          
                              JAKE
                    Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling
                    me what I couldn't do.
          
          Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the
          link chair by hand.
          
                                                                       18.
          
          
          
          Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit.
          It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors,
          then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL --
          
                              GRACE
                    Relax and let your mind go blank.    That
                    shouldn't be hard for you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --
          
          But the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest.

          The LINK TECH touches some controls.
          
          ON A LARGE MONITOR a 3D SCAN of Jake's brain appears.
          Regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors.

                    That's a gorgeous brain.     Nice activity.
          
                               GRACE
                    Go figure.
                        (walking away)
                    Alright, I'm going in.

          Max watches a display showing the avatar's nervous system
          aligning with Jake's -- two ghostly networks of light
          merging.

          ECU JAKE, inside the link unit. His eyes move under the
          lids, like a dreamer in REM sleep as --
          
          INSIDE JAKE'S MIND -- radiant streamers coalesce into a
          pulsing TUNNEL OF LIGHT and --
          
          THE SCREEN FLARES WHITE -- ZZZWHAP! -- resolving into an
          overexposed, out-of-focus image -- two BLURRY FACES wearing
          masks, looking down.
          
          ECU JAKE'S AVATAR -- two very intense eyes FILL FRAME, the
          pupils contracting. Golden irises pulse with life.

                    is stable.
          
          Blinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney. He looks down
          at his AVATAR BODY, touching his chest with one hand.
          
                              MAX
                    Take it slow, Jake. We need to check
                    your motor control. Try touching your
                    fingertips together --
          
          But Jake isn't listening. He's staring at his legs.     He
          eases them off the gurney and --
          
          HIS BLUE FEET touch the concrete floor, taking his weight.
          
          JAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs.    His
          expression is child-like with wonder.
          
          HIS POV -- looking down at the med techs, who seem the size
          of children next to his 9' tall frame.
          
          He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm
          and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL.
          
          As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a
          table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max.
          
                              MED TECH
                    Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down --
          
          But Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio-
          monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest.
          
                              MAX
                    Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests --

          door and --

          Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself
          in the AVATAR COMPOUND -- a living and training area.
          
          Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing one-on-one in front
          of a (non-regulation height) basketball net. Others go about
          their daily activities around the compound.
          
                                                                       20.
          
          
          
          Jake flexes his legs -- JUMPS -- and lands a little
          unsteadily, but his expression is joyful.
          
          He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are
          calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them -- he's
          running. RUNNING!
          
          He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid
          neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling
          his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply -- revelling
          in the alien smells -- earth, plants, the nearby forest. He
          looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world.
          
                              GRACE (O.S.)
                    Hey Marine!
          
          Jake turns at the familiar voice to see --
          
          A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE
          is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach
          and firm athlete's breasts. She wears shorts and a T-shirt.
          In human years she would be about 35.
          
                                JAKE
                    Grace?
          
                              GRACE
                    Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?   Think
                    fast!
          
          She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches.
          
                              GRACE
                    Motor control is looking good.
          
          Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin.
          
                              NORM (O.S.)
                    Hey, check it out.
          
          Jake turns to see NORM'S AVATAR posing like a bodybuilder --
          chest shot, back shot, bi's.
          
                              NORM
                    I am a living god.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. MINE PIT - DAY
          
          A WIDE SHOT of the terraced crater of the UNOBTANIUM MINE.    A
          quiet beat, then --
          
                                                                     21.
          
          
          
          K-WHOOOOM! The entire face of one terrace is blown skyward
          in a chain of EXPLOSIONS. The "shot" blasts hundreds of tons
          of rock loose.
          
          LONG LENS ANGLES of enormous WHEEL-LOADERS shovelling up ore-
          rich rock and dropping it into DUMP TRUCKS.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          A wall of steel FILLS FRAME. The DOZER BLADE crushes
          everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling.
          
          WIDER, showing the CLEAR-CUTTING operation near the mine, as
          a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS
          three stories tall rip into the tree-line.
          
          One of the dozers has rotating SLASH-CUTTER, a vicious
          spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through
          the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood-shrapnel.
          
          The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL
          QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing
          breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
          
          A BANSHEE -- a fearsome aerial predator -- HURTLES from
          above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. We get a
          glimpse of glassy fangs before --
          
          P-P-POOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his
          massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK.
          
          It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed
          rounds. The newbies stare at the thing's barracuda teeth.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    For you pogues, this is a banshee. A
                    small one. See, they like it when I
                    bring fresh meat out here. And this
                    clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's
                    nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If
                    it moves, shoot it. If you're not sure
                    it's moving -- shoot it! If it looks like
                    a bunch of flowers you want to take home
                    to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT!
                    What're you gonna do?
          
                              TROOPERS
                    Shoot it, sir!
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Outstanding. Let's roll.
          
                                                                      22.
          
          
          
          Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his
          eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an
          AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush.
          
          As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the
          trail -- an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and
          feathers hanging across the trail like an orb-weaver's web.
          
          He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it
          into the mud as he moves on.
          
          INT. AVATAR LONGHOUSE - DUSK
          
          Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropical-style
          construction -- beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen.
          
          Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night,
          pulling insect netting around their cots. In one hand, Jake
          holds the end of his long braided QUEUE of hair.
          
          CLOSE ON the queue -- the ends of the hair writhe slowly with
          their own life, like tendrils of a sea creature.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's kinda freaky.
          
          GRACE switches off the overheads.
          
                              GRACE
                    Lights out amigos.     See ya' at dinner.
          
          Jake sits in the twilight, listening to the SCREECHES and
          HOOTS from the forest. Finally he lies down, CLOSING HIS
          EYES and --
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT
          
          ECU HUMAN JAKE -- his eyes OPEN.
          
          Jake blinks, disoriented, as Max opens the upper clamshell of
          his link unit.
          
          In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her
          neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette.
          
                              GRACE
                        (looking down)
                    Damn. Same old sack a' bones.
          
          JAKE struggles with the dead weight of his legs as he hauls
          himself out of the unit.
                                                                   CUT TO
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - EARLY MORNING
          
          JAKE sits with GRACE, NORM and the other avatar "drivers",
          while around them miners, troopers and other base personnel
          wolf their breakfasts. Grace is engaged in a heated
          conversation with another SCIENTIST.
          
          Jake, isolated from the conversations around him, notices --
          
          PILOT TRUDY CHACON approaching, dressed in her flight suit.
          She's a rock-hard former Marine with thousands of flight
          hours out in the badlands.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the
                    Armor Bay.
          
          Jake gives Norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table.
          He wheels away, led by Trudy.
          
          TIGHT ON GRACE, scowling as she watches him go.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY - MORNING
          
          JAKE AND TRUDY enter the ARMOR BAY, passing TILT-ROTORS under
          repair. There are the heavily armed SCORPIONS as well as
          several SA-2 SAMSON work-horses outfitted with door guns and
          rocket pods.
          
                              JAKE
                    You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing
                    flyin' around out there. Or the biggest.
                    I'm gonna need you on a door gun, I'm a
                    man short.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah, no problem.
          
          She extends her fist and he taps it with his.
          
                              TRUDY
                    See ya on the flight-line, zero nine.
                        (she points)
                    He's down there.
          
          Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor
          Bay, passing rows of AMPSUITS standing in service racks.
          Techs clamber over the `suits, loading ordinance with cranes
          and lifts.
          
                                                                      24.
          
          
          
          At the end of the row is a makeshift GYM area.   QUARITCH is
          bench-pressing massive plates.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    This low gravity makes you soft.
                        (pushing the last rep)
                    You get soft, Pandora will shit you out
                    dead with zero warning.
          
          Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela
                    -- that was some mean bush. Nothing like
                    this here, though. You got heart kid,
                    coming out here.
          
                              JAKE
                    I figured -- just another hellhole.
          
          Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder.
          The CHIEF MECHANIC yells from the nearest AMPSUIT --
          
                              MECHANIC
                    That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to
                    try it.
          
          Quaritch crosses to the `suit, with Jake following.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
                    you. More than a few. Two tours in
                    Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here
                    and --
          
          He points to his scarred face.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    They could fix this if I rotated back.
                    But you know what? I kinda like it.
                    Reminds me every day what's out there.
                    Besides, I can't leave --
          
          He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree-
          line.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    This is my war, here.
          
          Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit,
          throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up
          with a rising WHINE.
          
                                                                       25.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    The avatar program is a joke -- buncha
                    limpdick scientists. But we have a
                    unique opportunity here, you and I. A
                    recon Marine in an avatar body could get
                    me the intel I need, on the ground, right
                    in the hostiles' camp.
          
          The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the `suit trembles with
          power. The air boils above the exhaust vents.
          
          Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one
          huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Looks good.
                        (to Jake)
                    I need you to learn about these savages,
                    gain their trust. Find out how I can
                    force their cooperation, or hit `em hard
                    if they don't. Maybe you can keep some
                    of my boys from going home like you. Or
                    bagged-and-tagged.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NODDING)
                    That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am
                    I still with Augustine?
          
                              QUARITCH
                    On paper. You walk like one of her
                    science pukes, you quack like one, but
                    you report to me. Can you do that for
                    me?
          
          Jake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps
          forward and pivots smoothly.
          
          He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping
          the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing
          a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.
          He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind
          of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get
                    me what I need, I'll see you get your
                    legs back when you rotate home. Your real
                    legs.
          
          He raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like
          the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge
          feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG!
          
                                                                      26.

          GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their
          FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX.
          
                              GRACE
                    Start calibrating. We're on the flight
                    line in ten minutes.
          
          Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM
          fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR.
          
                              GRACE
                    What did Atilla want?
          
                              JAKE
                    Just Marines comparin' tattoos.
          
                              GRACE
                        (not buying it)
                    Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --
          
          She stops, turning to drill him with a look.
          
                              GRACE
                    -- you're driving an avatar, now.     That
                    means you're in my world, got it?
          
                               JAKE
                    Got it.
          
          She turns and enters the LINK ROOM.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          Grace crosses to the controls of Jake's LINK UNIT. As the
          others catch up --
          
                              GRACE
                    That son of a bitch has screwed up this
                    program enough. All this --
                        (indicating link room)
                    -- exists so we can go out there and
                    build a bridge of trust to these people,
                    who could teach us so much. But thanks
                    to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't
                    even talk to us anymore.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then how's this supposed to work?
          
                                                                     27.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    We have a new face.
                        (turning to Norm)
                    You're fluent, you've studied the
                    culture. You're non-threatening. The
                    ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan --
                    may give you a chance. Maybe you can get
                    them back to the table before things go
                    tits-up for good.
          
                              NORM
                    This is failing as a pep talk.
          
          Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link.
          
                              JAKE
                    How do we contact them?
          
                              GRACE
                    We don't. They contact us. If they see
                    us taking our samples, treating the
                    forest with respect --
                        (pointedly to Jake)
                    Not trampling everything in sight --
                    they may reach out to us.
          
                              JAKE
                    Or they may skin us and make a drum.
          
          Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body.
          
                              GRACE
                    Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do
                    the talking.
          
          She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we --
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL - DAY
          
          FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and
          cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY'S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its
          shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is
          tiny in the vast primeval landscape.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper
          WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun,
          scanning for aerial predators.
          
          In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest
          unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes.
          Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids.
          
                                                                       28.
          
          
          
          TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a
          shallow river.
          
                              TRUDY (INTERCOM)
                    Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock.
          
          Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see--
          A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures
          reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river.
          
                               GRACE
                    Looks like a bull, six cows and some
                    juveniles.
          
                              NORM
                    The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
          
          Grace nods approvingly.
          
          TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight
          from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water
          above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS.
          
          TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a
          WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling
          in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run.
          
          Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he's about to puke.
          
                                 WAINFLEET
                    Yo Chacon!     Get some!
          
          Jake grins into the airstream.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. CLEARING - DAY
          
          A small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like "grass"
          is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson
          settles to the ground.
          
          Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and
          hefts it like an assault rifle.
          
          He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree-
          line warily, weapons aimed.
          
          Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut
          down. Trudy kills the Samson's TURBINES.
          
          Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back.
          
                                                                    29.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Stay with the ship.
                        (for Jake)
                    One idiot with a gun's enough.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Whatever you say, Doc.
          
          Jake takes point as they enter the jungle.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Ya'll have fun out there.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          The forest engulfs JAKE, GRACE and NORM in cyan gloom. The
          shadows are alive with the CHITTERING sounds of unseen alien
          wildlife.
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE as he moves through the foliage, hyper-
          alert -- looking around like a tourist in Hell.A monkey-like
          PROLEMURIS leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing
          through the sunlight streaming down in shafts.
          
          A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he
          passes.
          
          This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that
          react and move like animals. Jake white-knuckles his rifle
          as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death.
          
                              GRACE
                    Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.
          
          She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower
          his muzzle as he follows her. Grace moves nimbly on the
          path, seemingly unconcerned.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. FOREST/ GLEN
          
          WIDE SHOT as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as
          ants. The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SCHOOL RUINS - DAY
          
          They enter a clearing with an OVERGROWN BUILDING made of
          timbers cut from the local trees, with a thatch roof. It is
          covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it.
          
                                                                     30.
          
          
          
                              NORM
                    How will they know we're here?
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm sure they're watching us right now.
          
          Norm gulps. Jake looks behind him as they approach the
          school, feeling unseen eyes.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. SCHOOL RUINS
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE'S BOOTS as he steps among dried leaves and
          a few moldering CHILDREN'S BOOKS. Floorboards CREAK.
          
                              GRACE (O.S.)
                    The kids were so bright, so eager to
                    learn... they picked up English faster
                    than I could teach it to them.
          
          WIDER as Jake explores the room. Grace and Norm are selecting
          INSTRUMENTS from storage cases on a wooden table.
          
                              GRACE
                    Bring the soil probe -- right there,
                    yellow case.
          
          Jake looks up at a RUSTLING among the dark rafters. Roosting
          STINGBATS eye him warily, fluttering their wings.
          
          Grace picks up a moldering copy of "The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss
          from the floor and puts it back on a shelf.
          
                               GRACE
                        (WISTFULLY)
                    The stingbats knock them off. I guess I
                    always hope somebody will come back and
                    read them.
          
                              NORM
                    Why don't they come back?
          
                              GRACE
                        (GRIMLY)
                    The Na'vi learned as much about us as
                    they needed to know.
          
          Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard -- reaches
          out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate.
          Unmistakably BULLET HOLES.
          
                                                                       31.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (turning to her)
                    What happened here?
          
                              GRACE
                        (SHARPLY)
                    Are you going to help with this gear?
                    We've got a lot to do.
          
          She turns away.   Jake watches her as he jams equipment into
          his pack.
                                                                     CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON Grace's blue hand gently brushing away soil,
          exposing a tangle of ROOT TENDRILS.
          
                              GRACE
                    See, right here where the roots of the
                    two trees interact.
          
          WIDER -- GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal
          roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needle-like probe.
          Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots.
          
          JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters.
          
          He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulder-high SPIRAL PLANTS
          called HELICORADIANS.
          
          He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! -- it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in
          the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish.
          
          Curious, Jake touches another -- SHTOONK! And another --
          like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK!
          SHTOONK!
          
          A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into
          the ground, REVEALING --
          
          A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but
          twice that size. Its massive, low-slung head has projections
          of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark.
          
          Its baleful eyes lock onto him.   Jake raises his rifle.
          
          Grace, alerted by the creature's SNORTS, runs to where she
          can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE.
          
                              GRACE
                    Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.
          
                                                                       32.
          
          
          
          The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide
          sledgehammer of a skull.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's already pissed off!
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.
          
          Jake starts to back away.   The hammerhead bellows again,
          pawing the earth.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's a territorial threat display. Do not
                    run, or he'll charge.
          
                              JAKE
                    What do I do?
          
                              GRACE
                    Hold your ground!
          
          The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering
          saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES --
          
          Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide
          and runs straight at the thing.
          
          It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT.
          
          ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked.
          
                               JAKE
                    Oh yeah!   Who's bad?! That's right.
          
          SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus --
          
          A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has
          ever conceived This thing could eat a T-rex and have the
          Alien for desert.
          
          It is a black six-limbed panther from Hell, with an armored
          head and massive distensible jaws.
          
          JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the
          hammerhead --
          
                              JAKE
                    That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!
          
          The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away
          through splintering undergrowth.
          
                                                                       33.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right motherf--
          
          A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see --
          
          THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing
          between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes.
          
          The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the
          hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face
          Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS.
          
                              JAKE
                    What about this one?       Run, don't run?
                    What?
          
                                 GRACE
                    Run.     Definitely RUN!
          
          Jake BOLTS as --
          
          The thanator LEAPS after him and --
          
          Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the
          beast to claw its way around to the side while --
          
          Jake scrambles up -- around -- over a tangle of roots and --
          
          SK-RASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off
          a trunk as --
          
          JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle
          the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but --
          
          JAKE dives under a massive root system, and --
          
          CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the
          root-trunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he
          rolls and crawls --
          
          Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks,
          sending chunks of wood flying. It's spittle sprays across
          Jake, jaws inches away as --
          
          He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the
          rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an
          ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and -- RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK
          away. Jake scrambles to escape but --
          
          GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and --
          
          The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a
          junkyard dog with a rabbit, only --
          
                                                                       34.
          
          
          
          It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and --
          
          He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its
          teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but --
          
          With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him,
          splintering trees.
          
          JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening
          black tornado shreds the forest behind him and --
          
          He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might --
          
          The thanator's jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies
          out into open space and --
          
          JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river.
          
          The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to
          rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon.
          
          Jake ducks under as -- FWHOOSH! -- black claws SLASH past
          his face amid turbulent bubbles.
          
          A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the
          thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and --
          
          Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract.
          
          EXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS - DAY
          
          The water boils below the cataract. Jake's head bursts
          through the surface, and he gasps for breath.
          
          He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a
          limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just
          lies there gasping on the trunk.
          
          Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which
          echoes across the jungle.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          JAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant
          leaves.   He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with
          his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          TRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like it's a
          minefield, carrying his SPEAR white-knuckled. He is freaked
          and hyper-alert.
          
                                                                        35.
          
          
          
          The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the
          sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the
          cyan gloom.
          
          POV FROM ABOVE -- looking down through leaves we watch Jake
          move warily through the forest.
          
          ECU -- TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows.
          
          DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to
          him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NA'VI
          GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving.
          
          She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders,
          and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful --
          for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be 18. Her
          name is NEYTIRI(nay-Tee-ree).
          
          Jake passes less than 2 meters beneath her, oblivious.
          
          NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement
          she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT
          JAKE. Utterly silent.
          
          Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his
          THROAT.
          
          ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing
          for the shot --
          
          -- and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G.    She
          hesitates.
          
          RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow -- where a single
          WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrow-head.Like a
          dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky
          CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It
          glows faintly in the dark shadows.
          
          NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly.   The
          woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom.
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          INT./EXT. SAMSON - SUNSET
          
          GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY
          banks in a search pattern.
          
                              TRUDY (INTERCOM)
                    I'm going to have to call it, guys. We're
                    not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's
                    orders.
          
                                                                        36.
          
          
          
          Grace looks to the west.    The sun setting behind alien trees.
          
                              GRACE
                    Shit.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang
                    on `till morning.
          
                              GRACE
                    He's not going to make it till morning.
          
          Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard,
          thundering away toward the setting sun.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          LONG LENS-- POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the
          black trees.
          
          Jake's got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid
          grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by
          a pack of VIPERWOLVES.
          
          Jake catches only glimpses -- a glint of eyes, a slinking
          black movement -- then nothing. Darkness.
          
          TIME CUT -- TIGHT ON Jake's hands as he knots his T-shirt
          around the butt end of the spear.
          
          ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a tree-trunk. Jake jams
          the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it.
          
          A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch.
          
          The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing,
          leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the
          trail.
          
          Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES.
          Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Black-on-black
          SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid.
          
          He looks up -- sees one cross a limb overhead.   Another on
          his opposite flank.
          
          Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH.
          
          The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey.
          They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees.
          
                                                                       37.
          
          
          
          JAKE RUNS by torch-light, on the edge of panic. He reaches a
          steep banked stream and -- without thinking -- runs across it
          on a horizontal trunk --
          
          -- and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates
          GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The
          viperwolves have him encircled.
          
          The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each
          other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on
          his legs from behind but --
          
          JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face.   It yips and goes
          past, but ANOTHER moves in --
          
          He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,
          retreating, baring its fangs.
          
          Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees
          what he's up against.   The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with
          shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.
          Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.
          
          Jake realizes that he is making his final stand.   He whirls
          the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --
          
          And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a
          lightning bolt and the fear is gone.
          
                              JAKE
                        (SCREAMING)
                    I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!
                    Come on!
          
          With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.
          
          Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --
          
          ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking
          true, but --
          
          Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes
          flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--
          
          A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in
          pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --
          
          CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.
          
          JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf
          leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake
          tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --
          
                                                                       38.
          
          
          
          THREE WOLVES charge at once.     The nearest LEAPS at his throat
          just as --
          
          THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.
          
          The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight.    He pushes it
          off in time to see --
          
          A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw
          and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another
          wolf falls.
          
          NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the
          skull of a circling wolf.
          
          ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but
          rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.
          
          Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.
          
          SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,
          but --
          
          It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its
          throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.
          
          MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT
          across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
          
          The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past
          them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--
          
          They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    Raaaarrrr!
          
          Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his
          weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it
          and looks up at --
          
          NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening
          to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is
          over, she turns.
          
          She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.
          Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.
          
                              JAKE
                    Wait, don't --
          
                                                                       39.
          
          
          
          Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still
          see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest
          is transformed.
          
          The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and
          patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.
          
          Jake scrambles to recover his spear.   Neytiri kneels beside --
          
          A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,
          trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its
          chest.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (in Na'vi)
                    Forgive me, my brother.
          
          She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches
          its head gently, regarding it with sadness.
          
          Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her
          waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling
          the arrow from its heart.
          
                              JAKE
                    Look, um, I know you probably don't
                    understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
                    you. I owe you.
          
          Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead
          animal.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (in Na'vi)
                    Forgive me. May your spirit run with the
                    Great Mother.
          
                              JAKE
                    I would have been screwed if you hadn't
                    come along --
          
          She rises and walks away without looking at Jake.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?
          
          He crashes through some plants, catching up to her.
          
                              JAKE
                    Slow down a second will you. I just want
                    to thank you for killing those --
          
          He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --
          
                                                                     40.
          
          
          
          WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a
          fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.
          
          He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who
          speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Don't thank! You don't thank for this!
                    This is sad. Very sad, only.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm
                    sorry.
          
          She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    All this is your fault! They did not need
                    to die.
          
                              JAKE
                    They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy
                    HERE--
          
          She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Your fault! You are like a baby, making
                    noise, don't know what to do. You should
                    not come here, all of you! You only come
                    and make problems. Only.
          
          Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, fine, you love your little forest
                    friends. So why not just let them kill
                    my ass? What's the thinking?
          
          CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes
          MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big
          gold orbs.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Why save you?
          
                              JAKE
                    Yes, why save me?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You have a strong heart.   No fear.
          
          She leans closer --
          
                                                                       41.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    But stupid! Ignorant like a child!
          
          She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her.
          
          TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.
          
          WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which
          forms an elevated walkway.
          
          Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far
          above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move
          through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.
          
                              JAKE
                    If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should
                    teach me.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Sky people can not learn.   You do not
                    See.
          
          She leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised
          that he made it.
          
                               JAKE
                    Whooaa.
          
          He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then teach me to "see."
          
          She stops and he almost runs into her.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    No one can teach you to See.
          
          Then she turns and trots on.
          
          EXT. GORGE - NIGHT
          
          They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a
          horizontal trunk big as an oak.
          
          WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers
          silver in the Polyphemus-light. Vines hang down a hundred
          feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other
          night flyers.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just
                    got off on the wrong foot and --
          
                                                                       42.
          
          
          
          Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.
          
                              JAKE
                    --you just have to get to know me. I'm
                    Jake. Jake Sull--
          
          A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance.   He drops
          the spear and almost falls off the root.
          
                              JAKE
                    Whooaaa -- shit!
          
          Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He
          watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.
          
          She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE
                    I need your help.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You should not be here.
          
                              JAKE
                    So take me with you.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    No. You go back.
          
          DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE -- several WOODSPRITES float down
          through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently
          toward Jake and Neytiri.
          
          NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see --
          
          The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards
          Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head.
          
                              JAKE
                        (off her amazed look)
                    What?
          
          More woodsprites gather around him.   Several ALIGHT on him.
          
          Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow
          he's not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing
          all over his arms, hands, body.
          
                              JAKE
                    What are they?
          
          CU NEYTIRI -- reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread.
          
                                                                       43.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree --
                    very pure spirits.
          
          Jake -- now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT --
          moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He
          studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until --
          
          -- WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering
          into the darkness.
          
                              JAKE
                    What was that all about?
          
          Neytiri seems shaken.   She seizes his hand and pulls him
          after her.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Come!
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder.
          He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence
          shiver through them.
          
          Jake looks down as -- they cross a bed of purple MOSS which
          reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green
          light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each
          footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch
          down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.
          
          WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror-
          like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL.
          
          Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's your name?
          
          JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at
          him, spinning end for end and --
          
          SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs.   He topples off the root
          and crashes into the foliage below.
          
          JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --
          
          SEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding
          DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales.
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
          We see that the riders' QUEUES are connected to the horses'
          long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can
          command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.
          
          The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake
          turns to bolt, but --
          
          NA'VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed --
          blocking his retreat.
          
          Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the
          LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Na'vi --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Tsu'tey, what are you doing?! He is my
                    captive!
          
          TSU'TEY(tsu-Tay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted
          features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings
          off his mount with fluid grace.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These demons are forbidden here. I will
                    kill this one as a lesson to the others!
          
          Tsu'tey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake,
          confronting him warrior to warrior.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Stop! There has been a sign. This is a
                    matter for the Tsahik.
          
          Tsu'tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with
          her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts
          his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bring him.
          
          They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears
          and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu'tey
          and the others ride ahead.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri's village, which is
          sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250
          meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the
          largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.
          
                                                                      45.
          
          
          
          TSU'TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree,
          shouting an ululating WARNING.
          
          Jake is force-marched through the pillars into --
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the
          arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe --
          mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
          
          They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to
          outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow
          him.
          
          Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
          of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
          gallery -- a living cathedral.
          
          Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with
          fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
          
          The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous
          creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.
          Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --
          
          EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply
          chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS.
          His normally stern features are clouded further by anger.

                    Why do you bring this creature here?
          
          Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na'vi.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I was going to kill him, but there was a
                    sign from Eywa.
          
          He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake.

                    I have said no dreamwalker will come
                    here, to offend our home! His alien
                    smell fills my nose
          
          Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not
          submissive tone.
          
                                                                       46.

                    Father, many atokirina came to this
                    alien.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's going on?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    My father is deciding whether to kill
                    you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Your father!?
                        (to Eytukan)
                    Uh, good to meet you, sir.
          
          Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP
          to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as --
          
          A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber.
          
                               MO'AT
                        (NA'VI)
                    Step back!
          
          Everybody looks up.
          
          MO'AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down.
          She is a severe woman in her 50's. Her bearing is haughty,
          her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is
          elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I will look at this alien.
          
          There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core
          of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one
                    who interprets the will of Eywa.
          
                              JAKE
                    Who's Eywa?
          
          Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo'at passes.
          
          The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly
          around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue.
          
                                                                     47.
          
          
          
                              MO'AT
                        (thick accent)
                    What are you called?
          
                              JAKE
                    Jake Sully.
          
          She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a
          flourish she strikes his chest.
          
          Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some
          between her fingertips. She tastes it.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Why did you come to us?
          
                              JAKE
                    I came to learn.
          
                              MO'AT
                    We have tried to teach other Sky People.
                    It is hard to fill a cup which is already
                    full.
          
                              JAKE
                    My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
                    Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.
          
                              MO'AT
                    What are you?
          
                              JAKE
                    I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a
                    warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.

                    A warrior! I could kill him easily!
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    No! This is the first warrior
                    dreamwalker we have seen. We need to
                    learn more about him.
          
                              JAKE
                    What's going on?   What are they saying?
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Neytiri, subtitled)
                    Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
                    speak and walk as we do.
          
                                                                     48.
          
          
          
          NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Why me? That's not fair!     I only--
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    It is decided!
          
          Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Jake)
                    My daughter will teach you our ways.
                    Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if
                    your insanity can be cured.
          
          She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern --
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    He is your responsibility.
          
          Neytiri nods, accepting, but she's not a happy camper.   She
          grabs Jake's arm and pulls him roughly away.
          
                              JAKE
                    So it's all good, right?   You and me --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Do not speak.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE
          
          LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL.
          He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound
          with plant-fiber bandages.
          
          THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They
          stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the
          circle.
          
                              JAKE
                    Don't get up.
          
          Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with
          several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to
          Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY.
          
                              JAKE
                    You never told me your name.
          
                                                                       49.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.
          
                              JAKE
                    Okay, again, a whole lot slower.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (exaggerated slowness)
                    Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
          
          Jake knows she's baiting him.   He smiles in response.
          
                              JAKE
                    Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
          
          ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu'tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together,
          glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These aliens try to look like people, but
                    they can't.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    He seems dim to me.   And his eyes are too
                    small.
          
          NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving
          leaves onto his own leaf.
          
                              JAKE
                    Your mom likes me.    I can tell.
          
          MO'AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Neytiri will test this "warrior." Hey may
                    learn nothing -- but we will learn much.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                    You speak truth. We must understand
                    these Sky People if we are to drive them
                    out.
          
          Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing.
          
                              JAKE
                    These rock. What are they?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Teylu. You call beetle larvae.
          
                                                                       50.
          
          
          
          Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a
          CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and
          starts munching enthusiastically.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's some damn fine teylu. That's like
                    grandma's teylu.
          
          CU TSU'TEY, warily eyeing Jake --

                        (SUBTITLED)
                    I say she will kill him.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. THIRD LEVEL - NIGHT
          
          The sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven
          hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along
          SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree's outer shell.
          
          Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness
          around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl.
          She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes.
          
          Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night-
          light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads
          through him. He closes his eyes and --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. LINK ROOM - NIGHT
          
          GRACE is over JAKE in the Link, SLAPPING him, as Max and NORM
          hover.
          
                              GRACE
                    Come on back, kid, that's it.
          
                              JAKE
                    Wha --? Oh.
          
          He looks around, blinking.   Reality crashing in.
          
                              GRACE
                    Damn, you were dug in like a tick.
                        (she helps him sit up)
                    Is the avatar safe?
          
                              JAKE
                        (huge grin)
                    Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to
                    believe where I am.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          BREAKFAST the next day. The other drivers lean forward,
          hanging on Grace's re-telling of the tale.
          
                              GRACE
                    -- so the kid's out there one night and
                    he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering
                    him the spare room and the car keys.
                    Unbelievable.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's not something you can teach.
          
          Some of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in
          congratulation.
          
                              MAX
                    That's awesome, Jake.
          
          NORM chomps his bacon, fuming.
          
                               GRACE

                    For reasons I cannot fathom, the
                    Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us
                    all.

          INT. OPS CENTER - MORNING
          
          JAKE has reported to SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH. Quaritch turns
          from gazing out at the wall of forest, displaying a feral
          grin.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Jarhead clan?
                        (he laughs)
                    And that worked?
          
                              JAKE
                        (GRINNING)
                    Yeah. They want to study me.   See if I
                    can learn to be one of them.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    That's how you seize the initiative. I
                    wish I had ten more like you.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Look, Sully -- find out what these blue
                    monkeys want.

                              SELFRIDGE (cont'd)
                    We try to give them medicine and
                    education. Roads! But no -- they like
                    mud. I wouldn't care except --
          
          Selfridge turns to a large 3D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A
          road runs from Hell's Gate to a proposed new mine miles away.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Their damn village is sitting right over
                    the richest unobtanium deposit for a
                    hundred klicks in any direction. Which
                    sucks -- for them -- because they need to
                    relocate.
          
                              JAKE
                        (taking that in)
                    Does Augustine know about this?
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Yeah, she does, and she's on the next
                    ship back if she tries to cock-block me
                    on it.
          
                              JAKE
                    So -- who talks them into moving?
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (TURNING)
                    Guess.
          
                              JAKE
                    What if they won't go?
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (ICY)
                    I'm betting they will.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
                    there's one thing shareholders hate more
                    than bad press -- and that's a bad
                    quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to
                    get them to move, or it's going to have
                    to be all stick.
          
          Jake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You got three months.    That's when the
                    dozers get there.
          
                                 JAKE
                    I'm on it.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT. BIO LAB - MORNING
          
          JAKE pumps his chair across the lab, flanked by GRACE and
          NORM. Grace holds STEREO STILL PICTURES in front of him, one
          at a time -- images of clan members she has shot over the
          years -- a kind of flash card drill.

                    He's the clan leader --
                        (indicating Mo'at)
                    -- but she's the spiritual leader.   Like
                    a shaman.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          The dialogue is continuous as they enter.
          
                              JAKE
                    Got it. So who's this Eywa?
          
                              NORM
                    Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The
                    Great Mother. The goddess made up of all
                    living things. You'd know that if you
                    had any training whatsoever.
          
          He hauls himself from wheelchair to Link.
          
                              JAKE
                    Who's got a date with the chief's
                    daughter?
          
                              GRACE
                    Knock it off. Jesus, it's like
                    kindergarten around here.
          
          As Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace
          inputs commands at the control station.
          
                              GRACE
                    Neytiri was my best student. She and her
                    sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls.
          
                              JAKE
                    I didn't meet the sister.
          
                                                                       54.

                    No, she's dead.
                        (turning to him)
                    Okay, let's go -- village life starts
                    early.

          Grace lowers the bio-sensor array over Jake's chest.
          
                              GRACE
                    Don't do anything unusually stupid.
          
          She closes the clamshell and we --

          CU JAKE'S AVATAR, blinking awake, staring up at --
          
          HOMETREE, like a gothic cathedral overhead.   Sunlight streams
          down through gaps in the towering vault.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS - DAY
          
          JAKE walks among the villagers, who go about their daily
          tasks.
          
          -- young girls sit together, weaving and SINGING.    They look
          up as he passes, then go back to work.
          
          --two men clean the fish they've caught.
          
          -- a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an
          infant.
          
          --children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold
          LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops -- staring -- then shrieks
          with laughter as she runs back to her playmates.
          
          GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a
          DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed
          MARE. His grin drops.
          
          EXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE - DAY
          
          JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds
          its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts.
          
          Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue.
          He hesitantly touches them together and --
          
                                                                       55.
          
          
          
          TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE.
          
          Jake's PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse's
          eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her
          fingertips to the neural interface.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her
                    heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
                    legs.
          
          Jake closes his eyes, nodding.   One with the horse.
          
          TSU'TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest
          leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from
          the edge of the pool. Tsu'tey watches Jake's riding lesson
          with disdain.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You may tell her what to do --
                        (she touches her head)
                    -- inside. For now, say where to go.
          
                               JAKE
                    Forward.
          
          The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no
          idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He
          lands painfully in the mud.
          
          He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads
          the horse back to him.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Again.
          
          SERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various
          ways, seemingly landing harder each time.
          
          ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully
          rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees --
          
          TSU'TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow
          river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their
          hooves.
          
          Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu'tey stops his horse next
          to him, looking down with disdain.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    You should go away.
          
                                                                       56.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Neytiri)
                    I knew this guy could speak English.
          
          Tsu'tey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    This alien will learn nothing.   A rock
                    Sees more.
          
          She sighs in agreement. Tsu'tey and the other hunter wheel
          their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods.
          
          NEYTIRI gestures to Jake's horse.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Again.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Grouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE
          and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through
          plans he's made of Hometree's inner structure.
          
                              JAKE
                    You've got outer columns, then a
                    secondary ring here, and an inner ring.
                    Then a core structure, it's like a
                    spiral, that's how they move up and down.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I'm going to need accurate scans of all
                    these columns.
          
                              JAKE
                    Roger that.
          
          ANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. He's been watching Jake
          talking rapidly to Quaritch, but can't hear him. Frowning,
          he backs away, down the stairs.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          In the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so
          Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and
          Grace are behind them, in the jump-seats.
          
          Grace and Norm's UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back
          compartment.
          
                              TRUDY
                    It only takes tiny inputs.   Here, put
                    your hand on the cyclic --
          
          She points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly
          reaches over and rests his hand on hers.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Feel how small the moves are? You barely
                    have to think it, and the aircraft
                    reacts.
          
          ON NORM -- reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady-pilot.
          
          THE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK.
          
                              GRACE
                    See these magnetic formations.   We're
                    getting close.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.
          
          On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out.
          
                                                                       58.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Yup. We're in the flux vortex.
          
          AHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing --
          
          THE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.   Right in front of them.
          
                              NORM
                    Oh. My. God.
          
          Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out
          the front canopy.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- enormous islands of rock are hovering a half
          mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest,
          and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them.
          Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at
          the bottom.
          
          ON JAKE, staring in amazement.   It is both awe-inspiring and
          disturbing.
          
          Trudy turns, grinning at Jake.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You should see your face.
          
          WIDE AERIAL -- the Samson is tiny as it approaches the
          floating islands of rock. An archipelago among the clouds,
          they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace
                    explained it to me -- some kind of maglev
                    effect because unobtanium is a
                    superconductor, or something. At least
                    somebody understands it. Just not me.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SITE 26 - DAY
          
          A remote RESEARCH STATION -- TWO SHACKS and a few clusters of
          instruments perched on a promontory near the Hallelujah
          Mountains. The shacks are AIRLIFT MODULES the size of buses.
          
          THE SAMSON LANDS, beating the grass with its rotor-wash. The
          humans hop out, wearing MASKS.
          
          They move toward the Shack, taking in the spectacular
          panorama.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          INT. SHACK - DAY
          
          NORM and TRUDY assist JAKE with his chair as they cycle in
          through the AIRLOCK. GRACE is already inside, starting the
          GENNY. She turns on the lights and equipment.
          
          There are 4 bunks, a clutter of science gear, and -- through
          a short connecting corridor -- THREE LINK UNITS in the second
          module.
          
          As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at
          STEREO STILL PICTURES which are taped and tacked up around
          her workstation.
          
          CLOSE ON PICTURES -- Grace posing at the school with various
          grinning children. There is one of her with two lanky girls,
          a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, take number two, it's the least
                    glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate
                    Jake's link.
          
          Norm glares at Jake as he passes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hey. You got a problem?
          
          Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over.
          
                              NORM
                    I trained three years for this mission.
                    I speak the language fluently.
                        (he points at Jake)
                    He falls off the frickin' turnip truck
                    and all of a sudden he's cultural
                    ambassador!?
          
                              GRACE
                    It's not our choice, Norm.
          
          He glowers at Jake.
          
                              NORM
                    Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash
                    the dishes while you're on some
                    interspecies booty call.
          
          He stalks off.
          
                              GRACE
                    He can't go far.
          
                                                                      60.
          
          
          
          She points to Jake's link.
          
                              GRACE
                    Let's get you in.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT./EXT. HOMETREE - BANSHEE EYRIE
          
          LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the
          ground. Villagers are ant-like.
          
          Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core
          trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out
          of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto --
          
          A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see
          other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like
          enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
          
          NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of
          STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES
          clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
          
          Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the
          shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
          
          A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest
          banshees, this thing is taller than a Na'vi with a 10 meter
          wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it
          alights on the branch right in front of her.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Holy shit.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Do not look in her eye.
          
          Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and
          gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
          
          It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the
          shadows nearby answer.
          
          Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
          Banshee's ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the
          neural connection is made.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
                    made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
                    in the whole life.
          
          She climbs smoothly onto the animal's back.
          
                                                                       61.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must
                    choose your own ikran. And he must choose
                    you.
          
                                 JAKE
                    When?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When you are ready.
          
          The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    Heeyaaahh!
          
          Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee
          DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest
          canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a
          power climb.
          
          Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close
          SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks.
          
          ON NEYTIRI -- flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount,
          the rainforest rolling beneath her.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT/EXT
          
          STEREO VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- Jake has just switched on the
          camera. He looks tired.
          
                              JAKE
                    Do I have to do this?   I need some rack.
          
          GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling.
          
                              GRACE
                    No -- now, when it's fresh.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah, yeah.
                        (to camera)
                    The days are starting to blur together.
                    The language is a bitch, but I figure
                    it's like field-stripping a weapon.
                    Repetition.
          
          THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE:
          
          JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri
          touches her lips with her fingertips.
          
                                                                       62.
          
          
          
                                 JAKE
                    Seyri.
          
          She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence.
          
                              JAKE
                    Ontu, mikyun, nari.
          
          NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he
          draws a longbow.
          
          BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the
          elbow, repositioning him roughly.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Neytiri thinks I'm some kind of retard.
          
          HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see --
          
          TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norm's bunk. Norm blushes
          and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Norm's attitude has improved lately.
          
          NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen.
          
                                 NORM
                    Thank you?
          
                                 JAKE
                    Ireiyo.
          
          Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation.
          
                              NORM
                    Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.   You've gotta roll
                    the R, r-r-r-oll it.
          
          Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's good he's back on board, but he
                    thinks I'm a retard too.
          
          TRACKING WITH JAKE'S FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto
          a thick root, running on across the rough bark.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    My feet are getting tougher.   I can run
                    farther every day.
          
                                                                       63.
          
          
          
          Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are
          running 30 meters above the ground.
          
          He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up.
          She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I have to trust my body to know what to
                    do. With Neytiri it's learn fast or die.
          
          Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until --
          
          She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows
          its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and
          catches another.
          
          JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with
          him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic
          rush.
          
          He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a
          game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
          
          Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.   That he lived.
          
          TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at
          the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school.
          
          IN THE COMMONS -- AVATAR NORM formally greets MO'AT. The
          Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows.
          Grace's eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I sweet-talked Mo'at into giving Norm and
                    Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes
                    me coffee before link every morning.
          
          Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward
          moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of
          greeting.
          
                              GRACE
                        (Na'vi, subtitled)
                    I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out
          the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the
          plants around her, and sniffs the air.
          
                                                                      64.
          
          
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I'm learning to read the trails, the
                    tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
                    scents and sounds.
          
          JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as --
          
          A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows
          of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are
          sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
          
          One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes
          flight, an explosion of purple wings.
          
          Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
          
          ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her
          ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are
          closed. She speaks very softly to Jake --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When you hear nothing, you will hear
                    everything. When you see nothing, you
                    will See everything.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Sometimes I have no idea what she's
                    talking about.
          
          Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
          HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
          
          Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
          watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a
          beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's been a month and I'm still not
                    allowed to make a kill. She says the
                    forest hasn't given permission.
          
          OMIITED
          
          NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth.   She points
          and he parts some leaves to see --
          
          A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk
          around her legs. She licks their faces.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    There's a lot of crap like that. She's
                    always going on about the flow of energy--
                    the spirits of the animals and what not --
          
                                                                        65.
          
          
          
          VIDEO-LOG IMAGE -- HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens.    He's
          changing -- un-shaven, cheeks hollow. Pale.
          
                               JAKE
                        (SMIRKING)
                    I just hope this treehugger shit isn't on
                    the final.
          
          Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples.
          
                              GRACE
                        (without looking up)
                    This isn't just about eye-hand
                    coordination out there. You need to
                    listen to what she says. Try to see the
                    forest through their eyes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,
                    okay?
          
          NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by
          galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move
          gracefully, soundlessly -- two forest spirits.
          
          CU JAKE -- the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night
          forest floods his brain with its million bio-sources.
          
          NIGHT SHOT, from overhead -- Jake and Neytiri bow-fishing
          from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom
          of a pool.
          
          A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.      ZAP!
          Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting
          his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are
          GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders.
          
          Aware of her touch, Jake's focus is broken.   Their eyes meet,
          and she pulls away quickly.
          
          NIGHT -- they enter a CLEARING filled with chest-high ferns.
          Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature
          on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING
          perched on a frond. As he approaches --
          
          SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a
          bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening
          like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
          
          THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.
          
                                                                        66.
          
          
          
          Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An
          EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
          
          Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until
          they are all flying. And for the first time, she is
          unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He
          doesn't know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid,
          blinking at the light.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                    Everything is backwards now. Like out
                    there is the true world, and in here is
                    the dream.
          
          TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes
          focused in intense concentration. A beat -- the arrow flies.
          
          JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede.
          He dispatches it with his knife.
          
          He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Na'vi.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NA'VI)
                    I See you Brother, and thank you. Your
                    spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays
                    behind to become part of the People.
          
          NEYTIRI watches with approval.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    A clean kill. You are ready.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin.   Norm
          helps Grace get him to his chair.
          
                              GRACE
                    You're still losing weight.   Here --
          
          She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien
          food. Bites into it without enthusiasm.
          
                              JAKE
                    I made a kill today. We ate it.   I know
                    where that meal came from.
          
                                                                     67.
          
          
          
                               GRACE
                    Other body. You need to take care of
                    this body.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Yeah yeah.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap.
                    You're burning too hard.
          
          Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out.
          
                              JAKE
                    Get rid of this shit, then you can
                    lecture me.
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm telling you, as your boss and someone
                    who might even consider being a friend
                    someday, to take some down time.
          
                              JAKE
                    Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.
          
          GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee.
          
                              GRACE
                    Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee.
                    Or die trying.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right, Grace. This is what I've
                    been working for.
          
                              GRACE
                    And this is your check up from the neck
                    up, Marine. You're getting in way too
                    deep.
                        (she turns away)
                    Trust me, I learned the hard way.
          
          Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Grace's workstation.
          
                              JAKE
                    What did happen at the school?
          
          GRACE looks up from making coffee.   Her eyes track across the
          pictures of the laughing children.   Finally --
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped
                    coming to school. She was angry about
                    the clear-cutting.
          
          GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste.
          
                              GRACE
                    One day, she and a couple of other young
                    hunters came running in, all painted up --
                    they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess
                    they thought I could protect them.
          
          GRACE'S voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible
          story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator.
          
                              GRACE
                    The troopers pursued them to the
                    schoolhouse.
          
          MACRO as she pours the milk -- her hand is SHAKING.
          
                              GRACE
                    They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.
                    Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the
                    others.
                        (MILDLY)
                    I got most of the kids out, before they
                    shot me.
          
                              JAKE
                    Jesus.
          
                              GRACE
                    Yeah.
          
          Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and
          desperately trying to hide it.
          
                              GRACE
                    A scientist stays objective -- we can not
                    be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten
                    years of my life into that school. They
                    called me sa'atenuk. Mother.
                        (turning to him)
                    That kind of pain reaches back through
                    the link.
          
          GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's a job. Learn what you can -- but
                    don't get attached.
          
                                                                       69.
          
          
          
          GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes.
          
                              GRACE
                    It's not our world, Jake.   And we can't
                    stop what's coming.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DAY
          
          TSU'TEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail -- two
          TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, who's riding well enough to keep
          up. The horses' hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a
          misty canyon.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway
                    to heaven. It's the test every young
                    hunter has to pass.
          
          TSU'TEY signals a stop.
          
          UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like
          trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in
          their gnarled grip.
          
          A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the
          twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural
          occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the
          clouds.
          
          There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and
          the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --
          
          One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a
          nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is
          drifting toward them, filling half the sky.
          
          The Hunters dismount.
          
          JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He
          turns to Tsu'tey, who is checking the young hunters' gear.
          
                              JAKE
                    We doin' this?
          
          Jake leaps to catch up as Tsu'tey and the hunters swarm up
          the base of the beanstalk.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
                                                                       70.
          
          
          
          EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY
          
          200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along
          the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium
          BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
          
          JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of
          a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs
          over it -- it floats upward.
          
          They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,
          the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from
          one of the waterfalls hits them.
          
          Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper
          branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.
          
          One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.
          
          Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling
          over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands
          above.
          
          EXT. MONS VERITATIS - DAY
          
          TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small
          island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.
          
          WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome --
          the sheer side of Mons Veritatis.
          
          Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of
          sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.
          
          EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY
          
          A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the
          gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below
          -- a view from Olympus.
          
          A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S
          BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She
          dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven
          HOOD. It waits, docile, as --
          
          She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them
          through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And
          Jake sees --
          
          The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-
          croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls
          with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.
          
                                                                       71.
          
          
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Jakesully will go first.
          
          Tsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two
          teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.
          
          Tsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Now you choose your ikran. This you must
                    feel -- inside. If he also chooses you,
                    move quick, like I showed. You will have
                    one chance.
          
                              JAKE
                    How will I know if he chooses me?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    He will try to kill you.
          
                              JAKE
                    Outstanding.
          
          Out of sight of Tsu'tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes
          it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like
          it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --
          
          The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK
          and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing
          rows of fangs, in a threat display.
          
          Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.
          
          A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares
          straight at him.
          
          Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it.
          
                              JAKE
                    Let's dance.
          
          The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as--
          
          Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then
          slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.
          
          Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong
          whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED
          SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --
          
                                                                      72.
          
          
          
          Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the
          banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he
          SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head.
          
          Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his
          queue but --
          
          The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in
          the face, almost knocking him out and --
          
          IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the
          rock and almost goes over the edge as --
          
          NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly.
          
          The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way
          pissed off now, but --
          
          Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his
          leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN
          HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,
          pinning it and --
          
          Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams
          the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --
          
          The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting.   They
          are locked together, literally eye to eye.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right! You're mine.
          
          ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well.
          
          Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over
          the creature's back.
          
          Neytiri runs to him.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    First flight seals the bond. You cannot
                    wait.
          
          Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.   He grips
          a hank of the beast's main, and --
          
                              JAKE
                    Heeeyyyaaaah!
          
          THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS
          as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --
          
                                                                      73.
          
          
          
          They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is
          almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so
          much he can't think.
          
                               JAKE
                     Shut the hell up!!
          
          It does.
          
                                  JAKE
                     Level out!     Fly straight!
          
          It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left"
          and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy
          loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath.
          
          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE falls into formation with him.   She signals
          "follow me" and DIVES.
          
          Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiri's
          banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while
          Jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky.
          
          THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE
          around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning.
          They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines.
          
          Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the
          cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge
          into sunlight.
          
          Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right,
          then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back.
          He's reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT.
          
          Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT./EXT. GROTTO/MONS VERITATIS - DAY
          
          FLIGHT MONTAGE:
          
          NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight
          principles like one fighter pilot to another.
          
          LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive
          their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and
          soaring into a series of aerobatic turns.
          
                               JAKE (V.O.)
                     I may not be much of a horse guy.   But I
                     was born to do this.
          
                                                                      74.
          
          
          
          THEY FLY in close formation with TSU'TEY and the young
          HUNTERS, 5 banshees flashing through scarves of mist.
          
          ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri
          among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world.
          She grins and banks hard, diving -- catch me if you can. He
          DIVES after her.
          
          IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKE'S BANSHEE snaps at a piece
          of meat which he playfully pulls back. He's teaching it to
          take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head.
          
          TSU'TEY is nearby with the young hunters.   He eyes Jake with
          frustrated hostility.
          
          ANOTHER DAY -- Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily.
          She points and Jake sees --
          
          A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form
          rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the
          caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and
          ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RIDGE
          
          JAKE flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge. She is
          teaching him to hunt from his banshee. They carry their bows
          at the ready, scanning below them for prey.
          
          A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning.   Jake
          looks up to see --
          
          A LEONOPTERYX in a delta-dive, whistling straight at him.
          
          Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king
          predator of the air: the GREAT LEONOPTERYX.   Striped
          scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head
          -- it is both gorgeous and terrifying.
          
          The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snap-rolls and dives
          toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as --
          
          K-CRASH -- the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following
          him down, both diving like missiles and --
          
          JAKE yanks into a hair-pin bank, right through a gap between
          two huge branches --
          
          Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings.
          It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its
          mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          
          CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a
          bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The
          lord of its domain.
          
          ON JAKE, shaken. Neytiri flies up, her expression the Na'vi
          equivalent of Oh my God. A beat -- they both crack up.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation--
          science graphics of the Leonopteryx. Trudy and Norm are
          crowded around as well.
          
                              GRACE
                    The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial
                    predator. Not only rare, but the
                    sightings tend not to get reported.
          
          Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb.
          
                              TRUDY
                    There usually isn't time to key the mike.
          
                              JAKE
                    The People call it Toruk.
          
                              NORM
                        (TRANSLATING)
                    Last Shadow.
          
                              JAKE
                    Last one you ever see.
          
                              TRUDY
                    I saw one take out a gunship once --
                    WHAM! Total frickin' yard sale. Ate the
                    crew like peanuts.
          
          TIME CUT -- Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops
          her on one -- a 3D aerial shot of the strange arched
          formation.
          
                                 JAKE
                    That's it.
          
                              GRACE
                    Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls.
                    It's their most sacred place.
          
          She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the
          Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Something big is going on in there,
                    biologically. I'd die to get samples, but
                    outsiders are strictly forbidden.
          
          TIME CUT -- Jake looks through the pressure window at HUMAN
          GRACE and NORM outside. Wearing masks, they are taking
          readings from some time-series experiments Grace has set up.
          
          As TRUDY watches, JAKE works fast to download Grace's images
          of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip.
          
                              TRUDY
                    They're coming back.
          
          Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates. Torn by what he is
          doing.
          
                              TRUDY
                    If you don't give him something, he's
                    gonna shut us down.
          
          He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her
          flight-suit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Hey, guys.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE STARES up at the TOTEM SKULL, which we now recognize as
          that of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX. NEYTIRI watches as he reaches
          up to touch the tall indigo crest.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk
                    Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk
                    chose him. It has only happened five
                    times since the time of the First Songs.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's a long time.
          
          Neytiri takes his hand, because that's what the Na'vi do when
          they're telling you something important.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the
                    clans together in a time of great sorrow.
                    All Na'vi people know this story.
          
                                                                       77.
          
          
          
          PUSH IN SLOWLY on the skull totem, then --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RIVER BED - DAY
          
          JAKE, NEYTIRI and other FLYING HUNTERS swoop low above a HERD
          OF STURMBEEST -- a rapids of thundering muscle. Dust rises
          from this living river like steam from a python's back.
          
          TRACKING WITH the herd. A HUNTER appears in FG, astride a
          direhorse at full gallop. The sight is breathtaking. He
          hurls a 3 meter spear and one of the sturmbeest CRASHES down,
          flipping twice from momentum.
          
          JAKE ROLLS IN like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. He
          draws and fires his bow. The arrow strikes true, in the
          plexus between the armored shoulders and --
          
          THE BEAST crashes to the ground. Skids to a stop in a cloud
          of dust.
          
          NEYTIRI swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning
          wolfishly.
          
          CU TSU'TEY, banking around Jake's kill.   Jake looks up, and
          Tsu'tey SALUTES in grudging admiration.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          The central space is lit by a BONFIRE, around which the HUNT
          FESTIVAL is in full swing. Wild dancing. People gnawing on
          massive sturmbeest ribs. A bowl of some kava-like intoxicant
          is passed around.
          
          NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT.
          NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail.
          
          JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx
          attack with his hands. The leaping fire-light plays across
          the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It
          seems to watch Jake.
          
          TSU'TEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face.
          
          Jake braces himself -- and Tsu'tey holds up the KAVA BOWL,
          offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch?
          
          Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters
          hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm.
          
                                                                       78.
          
          
          
                               GRACE
                    Watch that stuff.   It'll knock you into
                    next week.
          
          Jake offers the bowl back to Tsu'tey.   They lock eyes.
          Tsu'tey drinks.
          
          LATER -- AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty
          bowls near the fire.
          
          WIDER ON JAKE and TSU'TEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters.
          Tsu'tey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I thought -- enough drink -- you would
                    not be so ugly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Sorry.
          
          Tsu'tey looks deep into the fire.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Your warriors -- hide inside machines --
                    fight from far away.
                        (he looks at Jake)
                    I did not think a sky person could be
                    brave.
          
          Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRI'S lithe shape runs through
          the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes
          Jake by the hand and pulls him up --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You must dance! It is the way.
          
          TSU'TEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening --
          the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger.
          
          The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of
          dancers.
          
          Jake takes Grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting.
          
          JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets
          himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal
          energy.
          
          GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so
          repressed, who lives within her.
          
          Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are
          looking only at each other.
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle
          are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN
          follow their look, seeing the obvious connection.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is
                    with Tsu'tey.
          
          ON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked
          with Neytiri.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          WIDE VISTA -- mist blowing through the treetops as the
          morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast,
          primeval land.
          
          UP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down
          like light in a cathedral.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    It's hard to put in words the deep
                    connection the People have to the forest.
          
          HIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri
          gently bends a large pitcher-like flower toward her, sipping
          nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly
          sensuous image.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    They see a network of energy that flows
                    through all living things. They know that
                    all energy is only borrowed--
          
          MACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops.   A blue
          hand picks the flower.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    -- and one day you have to give it back.
          
          LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of
          an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby
          in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed
          on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads.
          
          Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places
          a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body.
          
          Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO --
          
                                                                       80.
          
          
          
          JAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the
          lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and
          haggard, with a scraggly beard.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    Hard to believe it's only been three
                    months.
          
          JAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It
          is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He
          looks like a junkie watching a test pattern.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to the lens)
                    I can barely remember my old life. I'm
                    not sure who I am anymore.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. COMPOUND - DAY
          
          Under a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond
          the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE
          and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Good of you to stop by. How's it going
                    out there? Our blue friends all packed
                    up yet?
          
          Selfridge swings his DRIVER with good form.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    See, I keep hooking it.   It's the damn
                    pack.
          
          THE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads
          220. A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    The low gravity and the high air density
                    cancel out so --
          
                              JAKE
                    You called us back to report -- you want
                    to hear it or not?
          
                                SELFRIDGE
                    Go ahead.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake is making incredible progress, years
                    worth in just a few months. But -- we
                    need more time.
          
                                                                    81.
          
          
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Not what I was hoping to hear.
          
          It starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from
          his golf bag and snaps it open.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, it's their ancestral home.
                    They've lived there since before human
                    history began. You can spare them a few
                    more weeks.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    This thing is inevitable. What does it
                    matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr.
                    Augustine. You're out of time.
          
          He leaves them standing there to get drenched.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY
          
          A break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls
          up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake.
          He studies Jake's pale, sunken face. The scraggly beard.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are
                    you son?
          
          Jake can't meet his eyes.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Your last report was two weeks ago. I'm
                    starting to doubt your resolve. From what
                    I see, it's time to terminate this
                    mission.
          
          Jake eyes flare with alarm.
          
                                JAKE
                    No.    I can do this.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Look, you've given me plenty of usable
                    intel. Like this "Well of Souls" place --
                    I've got them by the balls with that,
                    when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it
                    will.
          
          Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what he's done.
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    So you'll get your legs back, like I
                    promised.
                        (puts his hand on Jake's
                         SHOULDER)
                    It's time to come in.
          
          Jake ponders this. Isn't this what he was doing all this for?
          
                              JAKE
                    I've gotta finish this thing. There's
                    one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the
                    final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm
                    one of them. They'll trust what I say...
          
          It's hard for him to even form these words --
          
                              JAKE
                    ... and I can negotiate the terms of
                    their relocation.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Then you need to get it done, Corporal.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Strange horizontal LIGHTNING branches through the floating
          mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. The sky is black
          and heavy with clouds.
          
          INT. SHACK KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking
          pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, I can't allow this.   You're just
                    not strong enough.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's the last door -- I'm going through
                    it. You can help me or get out of the
                    way.
          
          Jake pushes past her toward the corridor --
          
                              GRACE
                        (grabbing him)
                    Will you listen to me? Sometimes the
                    Na'vi themselves die in these vision
                    quests. The venom takes you to the edge
                    of death.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                        83.
          
                              GRACE (cont'd)
                    And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm-
                    - we have no idea what that'll do in an
                    avatar brain.
          
          Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor.
          
          GRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of
          LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside.
          
          Norm is initializing the Link.
          
                              NORM
                    Calibrating. Thirty seconds.
          
          She puts her hands on his shoulders.
          
                              GRACE
                    No matter what you prove out there-- you
                    are still in here.
                        (shaking him)
                    Right here.
          
                              JAKE
                    I have to go all the way -- become one of
                    THEM--
          
                              GRACE
                        (FURIOUSLY)
                    Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of
                    them!
          
          Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE' voice.
          
                              GRACE
                    Our life out there takes millions of
                    dollars of machinery to sustain. You
                    visit -- and you leave.
          
          During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering
          himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside.
          
                              GRACE
                        (SOFTENING)
                    You can never truly be with her.
          
          Jake stops, pinioned by the truth.   He seems suddenly very
          lost.
          
                              JAKE
                    You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch
                    sent me.
          
                              NORM
                    What?
          
                                                                      84.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right -- to embed with the
                    Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them
                    out of their home. By deceit or by
                    force, he didn't care. And if it turned
                    out to be force, then how best to do it.
          
          Norm is in shock.   But Grace is eerily calm.
          
                              GRACE
                    And what about now, Jake?
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm not that guy any more.
          
          Grace nods.   She's been on his journey every step of the way.
          
                               GRACE
                    I know.
          
                              JAKE
                    But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he
                    yanks me out -- I never see her again.
                    And if I tell her the truth, the clan
                    throws me out -- that's if they don't cut
                    my heart out and show it to me.
          
          Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them.   In his own perfect
          Hell.
          
                              NORM
                    They won't understand what you've done.
          
                              JAKE
                    They don't even have a word for "lie" --
                    they had to learn it from us.
          
          Grace sees he is on the verge of tears.   Lost and alone,
          between worlds.
          
                              GRACE
                    I know. I taught it to them.
          
                              JAKE
                        (PLEADING)
                    Grace. I've gotta go.   They're waiting.
          
                              NORM
                    Link is ready.
          
          Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid.
          
                                                                      85.
          
          
          
                             GRACE
                    Jake. You can't carry this burden much
                    longer.
          
                              JAKE
                        (smiling wanly)
                    It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind
                    probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
                    anyway.
          
          Grace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She
          watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar,
          somewhere out in the night.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Norm)
                    Prep my link. I'm going in.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
          
          JAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter
          paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron -- the
          Dream Hunt.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
                    know.
          
          Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer.
          
          TIME CUT. GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to
          HOMETREE'S LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down
          the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter.
          
          BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly
          into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and
          hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.
          
          TIME CUT -- MO'AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs,
          CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the
          smoke over himself with his palms.
          
          MACRO - MO'AT'S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with
          holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and
          draws it out of the wood.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree --
                    bless this worthy Hunter with a true
                    vision.
          
                                                                       86.
          
          
          
          MO'AT places the worm on Jake's out-stretched TONGUE. It
          twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She
          indicates he should chew. He does.
          
          MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a
          writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a
          scorpion.
          
          He places it against the back of Jake's neck and presses. The
          insect drives its stinger into Jake's skin and --
          
          Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake
          alone in the circle.
          
          Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.
          
          SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the
          faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening.
          
          Jake looks down at the palms of his hands.
          
          JAKE'S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground
          and --
          
          INSTANTLY the circle of Na'vi recedes, as if to a distant
          horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly
          distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS.
          
          ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and --
          
          The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees,
          which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral
          radiance. Jake looks down --
          
          JAKE'S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers
          stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread
          outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which
          connect to the roots of the trees and --
          
          CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in
          the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom
          contracts his muscles but --
          
          IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN
          CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X
          silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW.
          
          CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE
          RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which
          FILLS THE UNIVERSE and --
          
                                                                       87.
          
          
          
          REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles
          seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his
          head, while inside --
          
          TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the
          mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the
          wind of time blowing through him as --
          
          REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while --
          
          INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora --
          
          --but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that
          are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight.
          
          A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the
          devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow.
          Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and --
          
          PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly
          and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK
          which seems to echo to eternity and --
          
          SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body.
          He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room.
          
                              MO'AT
                    It is finished.
          
          Neytiri's face is flooded with relief.   The faces of the clan
          elders look at Jake expectantly.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Did your Spirit Animal come?
          
          Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu'tey and the elders. How
          can he tell them what he has seen?
          
          Mo'at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to
          peer into his troubled soul.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (to Jake)
                    Something has come.
                        (to the others, subtitled)
                    It will take time for the meaning to be
                    clear.
          
          She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He
          gets up, weakly.
          
                                                                       88.
          
          
          
          OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the
          others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what
          has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem,
          which seems to stare down at him.
          
          GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed.
          
          Eytukan places both hands on Jake's chest and holds them
          there.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    You are now a son of the Omaticaya.   You
                    are part of the People.
          
          All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around
          and putting their hands on Jake's shoulders, back, chest --
          hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them
          waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS
          RISES behind the trees.
          
          NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water.
          Jake follows her and --
          
          UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.
          
          They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden
          of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them.
          
          Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float
          weightlessly, as if between worlds.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their
          trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing
          tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains.
          
          Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their
          footsteps with expanding rings of light.
          
          It is an exquisitely beautiful spot.
          
          The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up
          her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.
          
                                                                       89.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This is a place for prayers to be heard.
                    And sometimes answered.
          
          Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his
          fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear
          the WHISPERING of ancient Na'vi VOICES.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's like -- a sound you feel.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of
                    Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who
                    live within Eywa.
          
          A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their
          shoulders and arms.
          
          They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense,
          almost luminous. He feels drawn into them.
          
          But she pulls back a little.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
                    own bow from the wood of Hometree.
                        (she looks away)
                    And you may choose a woman.
          
          The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual.   Jake
          suppresses a smile.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    We have many fine women. Ninat is the
                    best singer --
          
                              JAKE
                    I don't want Ninat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --
          
          Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've already chosen. But this woman must
                    also choose me.
          
          She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving
          gently over each other.
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    She already has.
          
          He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against
          his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other.
          
          Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Kissing is very good. But we have
                    something better.
          
          She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other
          on the faintly glowing moss.
          
          Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does
          the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the
          ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.
          
          MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle
          undulations.
          
          JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system
          and hers. The ultimate intimacy.
          
          They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of
          moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.
          
          THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with
          pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO --
          
          LATER. She is collapsed across his chest.     Spent.   He
          strokes her face tenderly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Neytiri, you know my real body is far
                    away, sleeping.
          
          She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    This body is real.
                        (she touches his forehead)
                    This spirit is real.
          
          Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    When I was first your teacher, I hated
                    all Sky People. But you have also taught
                    me.
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Spirit is all that matters.
          
                                                                       91.
          
          
          
          She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his
          heartbeat.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for
                    life.
          
                                 JAKE
                    We are?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Yes. It is our way.
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    Oh. I forgot to tell?
          
          He rouses up, making her look at him.
          
                              JAKE
                    Really, we are?
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    We are.
          
          Jake considers this.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's cool. I'm there.
          
          He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering
          him as he sleeps.
          
          INT. SHACK - NIGHT
          
          Jake's eyes open in the darkness. He just lies there,
          thinking. In his coffin. In another world.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN
          
          DAWN BREAKS in the sacred glade. Shafts of orange morning
          light. Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms. Maxfield
          Parrish painting. But then --
          
          THE ROAR OF ENGINES. Neytiri awakens with a start. The
          SPLINTERING, CRACKLING of forest being crushed under enormous
          treads gets louder.
          
          SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer
          becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows.
          She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Na'vi to wake up.
          
                                                                       92.
          
          
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come
                    back to me now. Jake!
          
          INT. SHACK - DAWN
          
          HUMAN JAKE is in a hurry to get back to the link. GRACE,
          still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs.
          
                              GRACE
                    Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to
                    force-feed a cripple.
          
          She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the
          plate under his nose.
          
                              GRACE
                        (GRINNING)
                    She's not going anywhere.
          
          He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN
          
          Neytiri SCREAMS as --
          
          The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground
          under the treads. AVATAR JAKE is directly in the path. She
          tries to lift him, but he is too heavy. She is screaming at
          him, frantically trying to wake him, as --
          
          INT. SHACK - DAWN
          
          Jake adjusts himself in the link chair. He hands Grace the
          empty plate.
          
                              GRACE
                    And when was the last time you took a
                    shower? Jesus, Marine.
          
          Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          AVATAR JAKE wakes up to see --
          
          NEYTIRI dragging him, screaming.   He leaps up as --
          
          THE DOZER pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the
          trees, plowing the earth before it.
          
          JAKE RUNS into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms.
          
                                                                       93.
          
          
          
                                JAKE
                    Hey!    Heeeey! Stop! Stop!
          
          He positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic
          juggernaut will see him.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON MONITOR -- Jake shouts but there's no sound feed.
          
          WIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the
          remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR.
          
                              OPERATOR
                    Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my
                    blade here.
          
          This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to
          the workstation.
          
          ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and
          ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable.
          
                              SUPERVISOR
                        (to Selfridge)
                    What do we do?
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Roll on. He'll move. These people have
                    to learn that we don't stop.
          
          TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward.
          
          ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below
          the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side.
          
          EXT. WILLOW GLADE
          
          JAKE grabs a rock and LEAPS onto the dozer.   He climbs
          quickly to the CAMERA MAST.
          
          SMASH! The rock crashes into the lens of the camera. Jake
          beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER

                    I'm blind.
          
          He pulls back on the throttles.

          THE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines
          continues because --
          
          MORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest
          before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS.
          Terrified animals flee before the onslaught.
          
          POWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest,
          blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the
          dozer. He rips off a BURST and --
          
          Rounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He
          grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From
          behind a screen of leaves, they watch as --
          
          THE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving
          only mud and wood splinters in their path.

          wrongness of it. She sobs as the willows die.

          A RAIDING PARTY of hunters, their bodies painted, raise

          among the hunters.

                    You do not speak here!
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels
          all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Neytiri, low)
                    Okay, listen. There's something I have to

                    need you to --
          
          He sees TSU'TEY striding toward them, his face a mask of

          Tsu'tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both
          hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass.

                    You mated with this woman?!
          
                               GRACE
                    Oh shit.
          
          Jake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri.   She goes to him,
          clutching his hand.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Is this true?
          
                              NEYTIRI
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    We are mated before Eywa. It is done.
          
          Tsu'tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished.
          
                                                                       96.
          
          
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is
                    changing. Everything is being destroyed!
          
          Tsu'tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    These aliens kill everything they touch,
                    like poison.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can
                    never be Tsahik. Your life will be
                    wasted.
          
          Neytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I have chosen.
          
          Tsu'tey draws his knife and --
          
                                 TSU'TEY
                    Yeeeeeaaa!
          
          LUNGES AT JAKE, who's ready this time -- he sidesteps,
          blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu'tey HARD in the face.
          
          Tsu'tey reels back, nose bleeding. He starts forward on a
          second attack but --
          
          Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Stop! This is not a proper challenge.
          
          Tsu'tey glares at Jake while sheathing his knife.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I challenge you.
          
                              GRACE
                    Jake, don't --
          
                                 JAKE
                    I accept.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          INT./EXT. SAMSON - DAY
          
          QUARITCH rides left seat as Trudy pilots through the
          mountains. She glances at him, then toggles the aircom.
          
                                 TRUDY
                       Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound
                       hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch
                       with me and --
          
          But Quaritch SLAMS the switch, cutting her off.
          
                                 QUARITCH
                       Did I tell you to announce us?
          
                                 TRUDY
                       Sorry sir, it's procedure.
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          Norm punches buttons on the comms console.
          
                                 NORM
                       Samson One Six?   Trudy?
                           (no answer)
                       Crap.
          
          He looks helplessly at Jake and Grace's link units -- no way
          to warn them.
          
          INT. HOMETREE - DAY
          
          TSU'TEY AND JAKE square off. Each holds a long, solid staff.
          The entire clan crowds around them in a circle.
          
                                 GRACE
                       What the hell are you doing?
          
                                 JAKE
                       It's the only way to get him to goddamn
                       listen.
          
          TSU'TEY LEAPS at Jake with a sharp cry and Jake parries with
          his staff. The staves CLACK off each other as the two
          combatants LEAP, DUCK and STRIKE furiously.
          
          Tsu'tey sweeps Jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the
          ankles, but --
          
          Jake ROLLS out of it and catches Tsu'tey in the belly with
          the blunt end.
          
                                                                            98.
          
          
          
          EXT. SITE 26 - DAY
          
          TRUDY'S SAMSON lands. QUARITCH and a posse of troopers jump
          down and rush the Shack.
          
          INT. COMMONS
          
          TSU'TEY wades in with a series of short, sharp blows. Jake
          swings with equal fury. Both fighting from the heart.
          
          The staves whistle through the air, and CLACK together like
          gunshots. Jake presses hard, and Tsu'tey staggers back,
          stumbling as --
          
          Jake lands a SOLID HIT, dropping him to his knees, just as --
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          THE INNER DOOR bangs open and QUARITCH stomps toward Grace's
          Link controls.
          
                                 NORM
                       Hey, hang on, you can't interrupt a link
                       in progress, it's dangerous -- wait!
          
          Quaritch shoves him aside and SMACKS his fist down on the
          POWER switch. Grace's unit goes dead and --
          
          INT. COMMONS
          
          AVATAR GRACE'S eyes roll back and she keels over.       NEYTIRI
          barely catches her before she hits the ground.
          
          JAKE parries as Tsu'tey swings but then --
          
          Jake's eyes go blank just as -- K-RACK! Tsu'tey puts one
          alongside his head. Jake sprawls, completely inert. Tsu'tey
          pokes him with his staff, then raises it and lets out a
          piercing VICTORY CRY.
          
          INT. SHACK - DAY
          
          JAKE SLAMS OPEN the Link, amped from the fight, furious --
          
                                 JAKE
                       Are you out of your goddamn mind?!
          
                                 QUARITCH
                       You crossed a line.
          
          Quaritch PUNCHES HIM HARD. Jake flops back, dazed. The
          troopers yank him out and ZIP-TIE his wrists.
          
                                                                       99.
          
          
          
          INT. COMMONS
          
          TSU'TEY draws his KNIFE, and bends down, grabbing Jake by the
          hair.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    This is a demon in a false body. It
                    should not live.
          
          He puts his knife to Jake's throat but --
          
          NEYTIRI BLIND-SIDES him at full tilt. Tsu'tey sprawls, rolls,
          comes up to see --
          
          Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her KNIFE and
          teeth bared, her ears flattened. She SNARLS with primal
          fury.
          
          Tsu'tey stands panting. He pushes through the crowd and walks
          away, calling for his hunters.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DUSK
          
          TIGHT ON MONITOR -- showing JAKE'S AVATAR FACE on the dozer
          camera, as he pounds a rock into the lens. The shot FREEZES
          on Jake's ANIMAL SNARL.
          
          WIDER -- HUMAN JAKE sits, bruised and bleeding, watching
          himself on the monitor. GRACE and NORM stand nearby, rubbing
          their wrists where the zip-ties bit in. SELFRIDGE and
          QUARITCH watch with disdain.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You let me down, son. You got a little
                    local pussy and completely forgot what
                    team you play for.
          
          Jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, listen, there may still be time
                    to --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Shut your fucking hole!
          
          Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritch's fury. But she
          meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch.
          
                                                                   100.

                    Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot
                    me?
                        (to Selfridge)
                    You need to muzzle your dog!
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Can we just take this down a couple
                    notches, please.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Quaritch)
                    You say you want to keep your people
                    alive. Start by listening to her.
          
          Jake nods to Grace to continue.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Selfridge)
                    This is bad, Parker. Those trees were
                    sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you
                    can't imagine.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You know what? You throw a stick in the
                    air around here it falls on some sacred
                    fern.
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here --
                    I'm talking about something real and
                    measurable in the biology of the forest.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                        (FRUSTRATED)
                    Which is what exactly?
          
          Grace's nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the
          need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific
          rigor.
          
                              GRACE
                        (to Jake)
                    I can't do this. How am I supposed to
                    reduce years of work to a sound bite for
                    the illiterate?
          
                              JAKE
                    Just tell him what you know in your
                    heart.
          
          She turns to Parker, steeling herself.
          
                                                                   101.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    Alright, look -- I don't have the answers
                    yet, I'm just now starting to even frame
                    the questions. What we think we know --
                    is that there's some kind of
                    electrochemical communication between the
                    roots of the trees. Like the synapses
                    between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
                    fourth connections to the trees around
                    it, and there are ten to the twelfth
                    trees on Pandora --
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    That's a lot I'm guessing.
          
                               GRACE
                    That's more connections than the human
                    brain. You get it? It's a network -- a
                    global network. And the Na'vi can access
                    it -- they can upload and download data --
                    memories -- at sites like the one you
                    destroyed.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    What the hell have you people been
                    smoking out there? They're just.
                    Goddamn. Trees.
          
                              GRACE
                    You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth
                    of this world isn't in the ground -- it's
                    all around us. The Na'vi know that, and
                    they're fighting to defend it. If you
                    want to share this world with them, you
                    need to understand them.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    We understand them just fine.   Thanks to
                    Jake here.
          
          Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a
          NEW CLIP on the main monitor --
          
          TIGHT ON MONITOR -- VIDEO-LOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard
          and borderline deranged, rambling in a late-night monologue.
          
                              JAKE (RECORDED)
                    They're not going to give up their home --
                    they're not gonna make a deal. For what?
                    Lite beer and shopping channel? There's
                    nothing we have that they want. We're a
                    horror to them. We're the monsters from
                    space.
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
          
          JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the
          people he has grown to love.
          
                              JAKE (RECORDED)
                    They're never going to leave Hometree.
          
          Quaritch FREEZES the recording.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Since a deal can't be made -- it gets
                    real simple.
                        (to Jake, icily)
                    So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I
                    might just give you a big wet kiss.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, we have to talk, like rational
                    people.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately
                    you're out of here on the next shuttle.
                    All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar
                    Program, effective now.
          
          ON JAKE, GRACE AND NORM, speechless.
                                                       SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
          
          A WALL OF FIRE. Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW
          MOTION, spears and bows held high.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - MORNING
          
          MONITOR SCREEN IMAGE -- WAINFLEET pans a camera across the
          smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a
          charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    They hit with banshees first. Set the
                    ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast.
          
          Quaritch and Selfridge look on grimly.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    The rest of the squad?
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the
                    equipment is totalled.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Christ.
          
                                                                     103.

          Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I can do it with minimal casualties to
                    the indigenous. We'll clear them out
                    with gas first. It'll be humane. More or
                    less.
          
          Selfridge sighs and rubs his face.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is
                    exactly the incident we needed.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Alright, let's pull the trigger.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. BIO LAB
          
          MAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment,
          under the watchful eye of armed SEC-OPS TROOPERS. JAKE,
          GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other.
          
                              GRACE
                    They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose,
                    to trigger a response. They're
                    fabricating this war to get what they
                    want.
          
                              NORM
                    I can't believe that.
          
                               JAKE
                    Yup. That's how it's done. When people
                    are sitting on shit you want, you make
                    them your enemy. Then you're justified in
                    taking it.
          
          TRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. She's wearing full
          flight gear and carrying her helmet.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're
                    gonna hit Hometree!
          
                                JAKE
                    When?
          
                                TRUDY
                    Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go.
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          
                              GRACE
                    My God.
          
          Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - DAY
          
          SELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the
          gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE
          charge toward him.
          
                              GRACE
                    Parker, wait. Stop! These are people
                    you're about to --
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    They're fly-bitten savages who live in a
                    tree! Look around -- I don't know about
                    you but I see a lot of trees. They can
                    move.
          
                              GRACE
                    For God's sake, there are children in
                    there. Babies!
          
                              JAKE
                    Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind
                    of blood on your hands. Let me try to
                    talk them out. They trust me.
          
          ON SELFRIDGE, considering this.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          SELFRIDGE and an escort of armed TROOPERS accompany Jake and
          Grace to the links. The two enter their units, as NORM and
          MAX prep the system.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You've got one hour. Unless you want
                    your girlfriend in there when the axe
                    comes down, you get them to evacuate. One
                    hour.
          
          Jake lowers the upper clamshell. Norm starts the sequence.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMONS -DAY
          
          The entire clan is gathered, with Eytukan and Mo'at
          presiding. Jake looks around, feeling the gaze of the People
          upon him. He steels himself, and speaks in clear Na'vi --
          
                                                                  105.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Eytukan, I have something to say, to
                    everyone.
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Speak, Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    A great evil is upon us. The Sky People
                    are coming to destroy Hometree. They
                    will be here soon.
          
          A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd.
          
                              JAKE
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    You have to leave, or you will die.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Are you certain of this?
          
                              JAKE
                    They sent me here to learn your ways. So
                    one day I could bring this message, and
                    you would believe it.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    What are you saying, Jake? You knew this
                    would happen?
          
          He is unable to meet her eyes.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yes.
                        (ANGUISHED)
                    At first it was just orders. Then
                    everything changed. I fell in love--
                    with the forest, with the Omaticaya
                    People --
                        (he looks at her)
                    -- with you. And by then, how could I
                    tell you?
          
          Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity
          of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I trusted you, Jake!
          
                                                                   106.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    You will never be one of the People!
                    NEVER!
          
          TSU'TEY yells to his HUNTERS --
          
                               TSUTEY
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bind them.
          
          They grab Jake, who doesn't resist. Others seize Grace.
          Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          SCORPION GUNSHIPS darken the sky as they come over the tops
          of the trees. At the head of the formation is one much
          larger ship, a monster 150 feet long -- the GENERAL DYNAMICS
          C-21 DRAGON GUNSHIP.
          
          Quaritch, next to the pilot of the Dragon, surveys the world
          below like Napoleon astride his horse.
          
          EXT. HOMETREE
          
          JAKE and GRACE are lashed to posts at the front entrance to
          Hometree. The People look up as --
          
          THE DRAGON and its escort of GUNSHIPS arrive over the trees.
          The DOWN-BLAST from their rotors creates a maelstrom of
          flying leaves and debris.
          
          IN THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches a targeting screen --
          a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed.
          
          TSU'TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the
          two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I think they mean to cut their throats if
                    we don't back off. Make sure you get a
                    nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto
                    the after-action report.
          
          JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsu'tey, the others gathered nearby --
          
                                                                      107.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    You have to get out of Hometree! Run to
                    the forest! Please, I'm begging you!
          
          EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSU'TEY and yells --
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Take the ikran! Attack from above!
          
          Tsu'tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree.
          
          IN THE COCKPIT Quaritch grows impatient.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Alright, let's get this done. Give me
                    forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the
                    front door.
          
                               GUNNER
                    Roger.   CS forties. Going hot.
          
                               QUARITCH
                    Fire.
          
          On the Dragon's stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up
          with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and --
          
          K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM! -- the inside of Hometree ERUPTS
          with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS.
          
          THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to
          cough and gag.
          
          Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the
          gunships with their longbows.
          
          IN THE DRAGON'S COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK
          against the armored windows.
          
          AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse.

                        (yelling/subtitled)
                    Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.
          
          The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling.
          Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas.
          
          JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings.
          
          KA-WHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons.
          FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree.
          
                                                                     108.
          
          
          
          INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up
          the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside,
          coughing and dragging wounded with them.
          
          High up in the trunk, TSU'TEY and his hunters leap rapidly
          from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball.
          
          OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and
          GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts.
          
          Out of the smoke, MO'AT appears in front of Jake.    She raises
          a KNIFE and --
          
          SLASHES DOWNWARD. Jake looks down, surprised, to see his
          bonds falling away. He meets her eyes, which are filled with
          horror, but also something else. Call it faith.
          
                              MO'AT
                    You are one of us.   Help us!
          
          Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free.
          
                              JAKE
                    We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the
                    columns.
          
          As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN.
          Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion.
          
          IN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away
          from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay,
                    switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the
                    base of the west columns.
          
                              PILOTS (V.O.)
                    Copy, switching missiles.
          
          IN TRUDY'S SAMSON -- she hears the other pilots acknowledging
          Quaritch's order.
          
                                TRUDY
                    Screw it.
          
          She takes her finger OFF the fire-control and pulls her
          aircraft out of formation.
          
          PUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his
          glasses.
          
                                                                      109.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Bring it down.
          
          MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships
          and --
          
          The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE
          BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and --
          
          The Omaticaya watch in horror as --
          
          HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE.
          
          In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty
          tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness.
          
          AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU'TEY and the other hunters spur
          their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as
          the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES.
          
          It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the
          lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY.
          
          HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a
          great cloud of dust and pulverized debris.
          
          IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Nice work people. Alright, let's light
                    it up.
          
          INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts
          of FIRE in the debris of Hometree.
          
          THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire-
          storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances.
          
          JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks.
          
                               JAKE
                    Neytiri!   Neytiri!
          
          GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away
          from the fire-storm.
          
          NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of
          the INFERNO. She sees --
          
          EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a
          spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him.
          
                                                                      110.
          
          
          
                              EYTUKAN
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the
                    People.
          
          In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands.
          
          She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief.
          
          JAKE reels out of the smoke.    Kneels next to her.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm sorry --
          
          She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears
          stream down her face.
          
                               NEYTIRI
                    Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never
                    come back!
          
          Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father's body.
          Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as --
          
          NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her
          stomach. Keening like an animal.
          
          SLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the
          burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I was a warrior who dreamed he could
                    bring peace. Sooner or later though, you
                    always have to wake up...
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          SELFRIDGE watches a video feed of the destruction on one of
          the monitors. Max and NORM stare in shock.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Pull the plug.
          
          A TROOPER crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the
          MASTER BREAKER --
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          The strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp.
          
          Elsewhere in the smoky Hell, Grace slumps unconscious. The
          crying kids pull at her. Mo'at, leading a group of
          Omaticaya, comes upon the scene.
          
                                                                     111.
          
          
          
          She grabs the kids and pulls them away, leaving Grace's
          avatar helpless in the path of the flames. She hesitates,
          then --
          
                               MO'AT
                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Bring her.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          BLACKNESS. Then the top clamshell of Jake's unit is yanked
          upward, and troopers grab him, zip-tie his wrists as we --
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DUSK
          
          ON A HILLSIDE -- a grieving Neytiri stands with Mo'at and the
          Omaticaya refugees. Two hunters pull Grace's avatar on a
          travois.
          
          They watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below. A
          great pall of smoke darkens the landscape.
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. LOCK-UP - NIGHT
          
          Jake, Grace, and Norm are in a common holding cell. They
          sit, staring in silence. Too wired to sleep, too emotionally
          drained to move.
          
                              GRACE
                    They never wanted us to succeed.
          
          AT THE DESK OUTSIDE, the lone TROOPER looks up as --
          
          TRUDY approaches along the corridor, pushing a stainless
          steel trolley.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Personally I think steak's too good for
                    these traitors.
          
                              GUARD
                    They get steak?    That's bullshit. Let me
                    see that --
          
          The guard bends to look into the hot cart and   --
          
          THE MUZZLE of Trudy's pistol presses behind his ear.
          
                                                                     112.
          
          
          
                              TRUDY
                    Oops.
                        (shoving him down)
                    All the way down, pendejo.
          
          She WHISTLES and MAX trots around the corner.
          
          Trudy binds the guard with one of his own zip-ties as Max
          grabs his KEY CARD and runs to the cell. Swipes the card.
          The door is rolling open when --
          
          ANOTHER TROOPER rounds the corner. Trudy takes him down with
          a sharp BLOW to the windpipe and a THAI KNEE to the ribs.
          
          Meanwhile the first TROOPER is getting up, but Max CLOCKS him
          heartily with a coffee urn. He goes down and stays down.
          
                              MAX
                    That was unexpectedly satisfying.
          
          Trudy plants a kiss on Norm as he runs out of the cell.
          
                              NORM
                    Baby, you rock.
          
          Jake wheels out, grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper
          as Trudy binds his wrists.
          
                              JAKE
                        (to Max and Trudy)
                    Thanks.
          
          Jake faces his motley group, chambering a round.
          
                              JAKE
                    So what do you say?    Time for a
                    revolution?
          
                                GRACE
                    I'm free.
          
          Trudy grins and taps his fist.
          
                                JAKE
                    Come on.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. UTILIDOR
          
          In the utility corridor under the base, Jake pumps the chair
          furiously, as the others jog. They reach an AIRLOCK and start
          donning EXOPACKS.
          
                                                                        113.
          
          
          
                                JAKE
                          (to Trudy)
                      Get your ship fired up.
          
          Trudy nods. She grabs Norm and enters the airlock.     Jake
          turns to Max.
          
                                JAKE
                      Stay here. I need somebody on the inside
                      I can trust.
          
          Max nods.   Jake grips his hand tightly.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. AIRFIELD - NIGHT
          
          IN THE SAMSON, Norm is helping Trudy race through the
          preflight checks as the turbines spool up. A LIGHT hits
          them.
          
          An armored TROOPER approaches, aiming his AR at them.
          
                                TROOPER
                      I need you to shut down and step out of
                      the vehicle! Now!
          
          JAKE rolls up behind him, aiming his pistol.
          
                                JAKE
                      Take it nice and easy, troop.
          
          The trooper turns, sees the gun.
          
                                 JAKE
                      On the ground, face down. Hands behind
                      your head.
          
          The trooper hesitates.
          
                                GRACE
                      Do what he goddamn says!
          
          He does. Norm jumps down and grabs the trooper's rifle and
          side-arm, covering him, while Grace helps Jake from chair to
          the back bay of the chopper. She throws his chair in, and
          jumps in herself.
          
                                JAKE
                      Go! Go! Go!
          
                                                                     114.
          
          
          
          INT. OPS CENTER - NIGHT
          
          QUARITCH, watching a monitor, sees what's happening down at
          the airfield. He slams his palm down on an ALARM BUTTON.
          
          He draws his PISTOL.   Strides toward the EMERGENCY DOOR. He
          undogs it.
          
          EXT. OPS CENTER/AIRFIELD - NIGHT
          
          HOLDING HIS BREATH Quaritch yanks the hatch open and strides
          onto the outer landing. Inside people scramble for MASKS.
          
          THE SAMSON lifts off in a blast of rotor-wash just as --
          
          QUARITCH OPENS FIRE and --
          
          ROUNDS rake the ship. Trudy banks hard, using the bottom to
          shield them. Bullets WHACK into the ship as she climbs-out
          over the tree-line.
          
          Jake's fist pumps the air exultantly.
          
                              JAKE
                    Oh yeah, baby!
          
                              GRACE
                    Aaahh, crap. Not again.
          
          He looks over at Grace and freezes. She is looking down at a
          BLOODY HAND. She clutches her abdomen, covering the
          spreading stain. Looks at Jake, wide-eyed.
          
                              GRACE
                    This is gonna ruin my whole day.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hang on, Grace.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          NORM'S AVATAR, with an AR slung over his shoulder, stands on
          the roof of the LINK MODULE. He gives a thumbs up signal.
          The lift cable goes taut and --
          
          The shack LIFTS OFF THE GROUND.
          
          Trudy's Samson beats the grass of the mountain meadow,
          straining to lift the module on a long-line sling. The shack
          sways as Trudy banks across forested slopes and heads deeper
          into the HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS.
          
                                                                    115.
          
          
          
          INT. SAMSON CABIN - NIGHT
          
          Outside the windows, clouds and cliffs pass by, lit by
          Polyphemus.
          
          Jake is yanking stuff out of the Samson's trauma bag, while
          Grace lies curled across two back seats, hugging her blood-
          soaked abdomen. She is pale and shocky.
          
          Trudy is flying on visual only, by the light of Polyphemus.
          Her instruments are showing gibberish.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Well, at least they won't be able to
                    track us up here. Not this deep in the
                    vortex.
          
                              JAKE
                    It's strongest at the Well of Souls,
                    right?
          
                               TRUDY
                    Yeah.
          
                              JAKE
                    Good, `cause that's where we're going.
          
                               TRUDY
                    Copy.
          
          He gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.
          
                              GRACE
                    Forget it, it doesn't matter.
          
          Jake grabs her shoulders.
          
                               JAKE
                    No!   The People can help you. I know it.
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Dawn light paints the massive ARCHES of magnetic rock above
          the Well of Souls.
          
          Tiny as an insect, the SAMSON passes.
          
                                                                     116.

                    The Well of Souls. The heart of the
                    forest. I knew the People would go
                    there.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
          
          The WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera 100 meters across. It is
          ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down
          the sheer rock walls like candle wax.
          
          AT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya
          refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping
          which forms a kind of dais and altar.
          
          Shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto,
          lighting a single willow -- the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and
          gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock.
          
          Its ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge
          with the roots of the willows ringing the Well -- forming a
          braided mat resembling the surface of a brain.
          
          Mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT.
          
                              MO'AT

          It bumps to the ground.

          Grace lies, comatose, in her open link. Trudy gives Jake a
          look that says "not much time." Jake feels Grace's cold
          forehead, then crosses to his own link.
          
          As Trudy helps him in, Norm rapidly preps the system.
          
                              NORM
                        (LOW)
                    Tsu'tey is Olo'eyctan now. He's not
                    going to let you get near that place.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've gotta try, Norm.
          
                                                                      117.
          
          
          
          Jake pulls the clamshell down and we --
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RUINS OF HOMETREE - DAY
          
          CU JAKE'S AVATAR -- HIS EYES OPEN. He sits up. The forest is
          silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun can't penetrate. The
          animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind.
          
                                  JAKE (V.O.)
                       Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face
                       them again, I was gonna have to change
                       the rules.
          
          DISSOLVE -- JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest
          beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen.
          Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell.
          
          JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles
          through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around
          him.
          
          A SCREECH.    Jake looks up as --
          
          HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in
          front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It
          nudges his chest like a horse.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       Sometimes your whole life boils down to
                       one insane move.
          
                                 JAKE
                       Come on, boy. Time to fly.

          THE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge
          where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him.
          
          It scans for prey below, its magnificent indigo-crested head
          cocking left, then right.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       The way I had it figured, Toruk is the
                       baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks
                       him. So why would he ever look up?
          
          FROM ABOVE -- THE SMALL SHADOW of Jake's banshee falls across
          the back of the mighty Toruk.
          
                                                                    118.

                    But that was just a theory.
          
          JAKE DIVES and WE RUSH DOWN toward the great beast and our
          own shadow then --

          tragic loss and yearning for deliverance.
          
          CLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE.   She
          looks up, and her eyes go wide as --
          
          A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward.   AN ENORMOUS
          SHADOW covers the crowd as --
          
          TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow
          its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the
          sun, seem to glow from within.
          
          The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast
          alights in their midst. And that's when they see --
          
          JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its
          antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the
          paralyzed Na'vi.
          
          Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts
          and strokes the magnificent animal's flank.
          
          NEYTIRI, TSU'TEY and MO'AT watch in stunned amazement as the
          legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them.

          ON THE FACES of the Omaticaya -- new hope dawning in their
          eyes. WHISPERS flow among them, the words REPEATED --
          
                              CROWD
                    Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto...

          Jake walks through the crowd, straight to Neytiri at the foot
          of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the
          emotion between them is powerful and pure.
          
                                 NEYTIRI
                    I See you.

                    I See you.
          
          Neytiri's eyes brim with tears.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I'm
                    not any more.
          
          Jake takes Neytiri's hand and climbs the steps of the dais.
          
          MO'AT steps back in awe as he approaches. He turns to
          Tsu'tey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension.
          Jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says --

                        (SUBTITLED)
                    Tsu'tey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I
                    stand before you, ready to serve the
                    People.
                        (then just for Tsu'tey)
                    You are Olo'eyctan, and you are the best
                    warrior. I can't do this without you.
          
          Tsu'tey struggles with his emotions. Finally --
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I will fly with you.

                    Grace is dying.     I beg the help of the
                    Great Mother.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Bring her, Jakesully.
          
          TIME CUT -- AVATAR JAKE carries Grace's HUMAN BODY, lightly
          in his arms like a child. Jake walks through the crowd to
          the dais, followed by NORM, who carries GRACE'S AVATAR.
          
                                                                   120.

                    Look where we are, Grace.
          
          Her eyes flutter open. She looks up wonderingly at the Mother
          Tree.
          
                              GRACE
                        (with a wan smile)
                    I need to take some samples.
          
          Mo'at directs them to lay both bodies among the roots on the
          altar-rock.
          
          Mo'at touches Jake's shoulder and he steps back.
          
                              MO'AT
                        (QUIETLY)
                    The Great Mother may choose to save all
                    that she is --
          
          Mo'at's hand indicates Grace's AVATAR --
          
                              MO'AT
                    -- in this body.
          
          CU JAKE, realizing the enormity of what she's saying.
          
                              JAKE
                    Is that possible?
          
                              MO'AT
                    Possible, yes. She must pass through the
                    Eye of Eywa -- and return. But Jakesully--
                    she is very weak.
          
          Jake kneels next to Grace, taking her tiny human hand in his
          avatar hand.
          
                              JAKE
                    Hang on, they're gonna fix you up.
          
          Grace is barely conscious.    She grips his hand.
          
                              GRACE
                    I -- always held back. But you gave them
                    your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.
          
          Jake feels his throat close with emotion.
          
          Grace's eyes blaze with intensity though her voice is faint.
          
                                                                     121.
          
          
          
                                 GRACE
                    Help them.     You do whatever it takes. You
                    hear me?
          
                                 JAKE
                    I will.
          
          TIME CUT -- MO'AT stands in a kind of trance amongst the
          tendrils of the Mother Tree.
          
          NEYTIRI and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. All the
          Omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums.
          
          MACRO SHOT -- fine, hairlike THREADS have emerged from the
          roots and are gently spreading over Grace's HUMAN skin.
          
          JAKE, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to
          the root-floor by a thousand connections.
          
          GRACE'S AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOT-
          CILIA-- they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body.
          
          The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the
          willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MO'AT, on her
          knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance
          state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE.
          
          GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED,
          as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be
          explained.
          
          ON HER HAND -- GRIPPING Jake's convulsively, as she tries to
          anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds --
          
                              GRACE
                    I'm with her Jake --
                        (an amazed whisper)
                    -- she's real --
          
          Grace SHUDDERS, as pain shoots through her. BLOOD seeps
          through the silken white root-cilia growing across her
          abdomen. Drowning WHITE in shocking CRIMSON.
          
          She exhales a last shuddering breath -- and goes STILL.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Grace!
          
          He sees the roots falling away from her human body.
          
          JAKE TURNS hopefully toward her AVATAR -- but the roots are
          falling away from it as well. It sleeps -- VACANT.
          
                                                                       122.
          
          
          
          MO'AT stops the chant. She crosses to Jake and kneels with
          him, touching his shoulder.
          
                              MO'AT
                    Her wounds were too great, there was not
                    enough time. She is with Eywa now.
          
          NEYTIRI removes Grace's mask and gently closes her eyes.
          
          Jake stands slowly, barely holding it together.
          
          NEYTIRI comes to him and he sees the despair and hope
          conflicting on her face --
          
          -- and he raises his head.   TURNS to face TSU'TEY and the
          CROWD.
          
                              JAKE
                    With your permission, I will Speak now.
                    You would honor me by translating.
          
          Tsu'tey gestures assent, and they face the clan together.
          
          JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Grace's death in the passion and
          fury of his voice. Tsu'tey TRANSLATES beside him.
          
                              JAKE
                    The Sky People have sent a message that
                    they can take whatever they want, and no
                    one can stop them. But we will send them
                    a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind
                    can carry you, tell the other clans to
                    come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to
                    them. Fly now with me brothers and
                    sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky
                    People that this is our land!
          
          TSU'TEY finishes with a bloodcurdling war-cry, and the entire
          CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest.
          
          JAKE takes Neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx.   He
          vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him.
          
          THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jake's
          leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a
          thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it.
          
          LONG LENS -- POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise
          like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different
          directions.
                                                                  CUT TO:

          EXT. CLAN GATHERING - NIGHT
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER
          CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We don't hear the
          words.
          
          TRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in
          flickering fire-light.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    We rode out to the four winds. To the
                    horse clans of the plain, to the ikran
                    people of the mountains. When Toruk
                    Macto called them, they came.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES -- SLOW MOTION as riders vault onto their
          armored direhorses. Banshee riders raise spears and bows,
          spurring their mounts to leap skyward.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
          
          With a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS.
          Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount.
          
          Around them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing.   A gathering of
          eagles.
          
          FROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Na'vi streaming down into
          the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest
          above it.
          
          DIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails.
          
          BANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the
          grotto.
          
          JAKE, standing next to the Leonopteryx, watches his army
          gathering.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. COMMISSARY - DAY
          
          It's standing room only as all base personnel are crowded
          into the dining hall. A portable 3D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has
          been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in
          front of the display image -- a classic pre-mission briefing.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    People, you are fighting for survival.
                    There's an aboriginal horde out there
                    massing for an attack. First slide.
          
                                                                      124.
          
          
          
          The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls.    It
          looks like Woodstock in the jungle.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    These orbital images show the hostiles'
                    numbers have gone from a couple of
                    hundred to over two thousand in one day,
                    and more are pouring in. By next week it
                    could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be
                    overrunning our perimeter here. We can't
                    wait. Our only security lies in pre-
                    emptive attack. We will fight terror
                    with terror.
          
          TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers.
          Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Next slide. This mountain stronghold is
                    supposedly protected by their deity.
                    When we destroy it, we will blast a
                    crater in their racial memory so deep
                    they won't come within a thousand klicks
                    of this place.
                                                                    CUT TO:
          
          INT. ARMOR BAY - DAY
          
          TROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line
          of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red-
          blooded redneck NRA supporters they are.
          
          BLASTING TECHS are setting radio-detonated primer charges
          into two-ton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are
          band-strapped together on pallets.
          
          TRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay
          as he walks through the full-scale mobilization.
          
          He approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of
          activity around the ampsuits.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    This thing is completely out of control!
          
          Quaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance
          loading.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to
                    turn the mine-workers local into a
                    freakin' militia!
          
                                                                     125.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    I declared threat condition red. That
                    puts all on-world assets under my
                    command.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You think you can pull this palace coup
                    shit on me?! I can have your ass with
                    one call --
          
          Quaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an
          ampsuit.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    You're a long way from Earth.
          
          Selfridge is paralyzed. Physical force -- against him?
          Quaritch releases him and walks away.
          
                              QUARITCH
                        (to his men)
                    Get him out of here.
          
          Several troopers converge on Selfridge.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                    You touch me you're so fired.
          
          He pushes through them and they escort him toward the door.
                                                                  CUT TO:

                    I don't know how secure this channel is.
          
                                 JAKE
                    Talk fast.
          
                              MAX
                    It's crazy here, Jake. It's full
                    mobilization. They're rigging the
                    shuttles as bombers. They've made up
                    these big pallets of mine explosives.
                    It's for some kind of shock and awe
                    campaign.

                              JAKE
                        (to Max)
                    Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can
                    cut some kinda deal before this thing
                    goes all the way.
          
                              MAX
                    No, Quaritch has taken over. He's

                    Oh six hundred tomorrow.
          
          Jake takes that in.

                    We're screwed.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You know he's gonna commit those bombers
                    straight to the Well of Souls.
          
                              JAKE
                    That's right. Because I gave it to him
                    on a plate.
          
                              TRUDY
                    We both did.
          
                              NORM
                    If he takes out the Well of Souls -- it's
                    over. It's their main line to Eywa, to
                    their ancestors -- it'll destroy them.
          
                              JAKE
                    Then I guess we better stop him.
          
          Jake looks like he's about to collapse.   He's gaunt, eyes
          deeply shadowed, hands shaking.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You need to get some rack.
          
                                                                      127.
          
          
          
          He grabs a packet of freeze-dried crystals and pours them
          directly into his mouth, chewing them up.
          
                              JAKE
                    Gonna have to settle for coffee.
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. BATTLE CAMP - DUSK
          
          TRACKING through the warrior camp above the Well of Souls.
          Hundreds of hunters from many clans prepare their weapons.
          
          Hunters paint the wings of their banshees like war ponies.
          DIREHORSES are painted and ornamented with totemic streamers.
          
          The Na'vi paint and pierce themselves. Dance. Bathe in the
          smoke of cleansing herbs -- RITUAL PURIFICATION. HUGE DRUMS
          are beaten. A dark primeval energy. They are psyching
          themselves up for battle.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    I was a warrior who dreamed he could
                    bring peace. But there was only one
                    thing I was ever really good at. Ooh-rah.
          
          TIME CUT -- Jake, Neytiri a group of banshee riders squat
          around an animal skin on which he has drawn the silhouette of
          a Scorpion gunship -- like a hunt totem.
          
                              JAKE
                        (Na'vi/subtitled)
                    Strike here and here.
          
          Jake splats red dye at the centers of the circles symbolizing
          the rotors. The Na'vi absorb the lesson eagerly, like kids.
          
          He sees TRUDY approaching and breaks off. Neytiri stays with
          the hunters, talking about what they've learned.
          
                              TRUDY
                        (LOW)
                    You know our chances suck.
          
                              JAKE
                    Yeah.
          
                              TRUDY
                    Going up against gunships with bows and
                    arrows...
          
                              JAKE
                    What's your point?
          
                                                                      128.
          
          
          
                              TRUDY
                        (NODDING)
                    Right.
          
          She taps his fist and walks away toward her SAMSON.
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT
          
          The cook-fires of the battle camp FLICKER like a
          constellation around the edge of the Well of Souls as --
          
          JAKE slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater.
          
          He moves to the MOTHER TREE -- gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC.
          The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the
          world.
          
          Jake steps forward. The willow-like tendrils SWAY toward
          him, moving in a breeze that isn't there.
          
                              JAKE
                    I've never done this in my life.
          
          He squats at the base of the tree.
          
                              JAKE
                    And I'm probably just talking to a tree
                    right now. But if you're there -- I need
                    to give you a heads up.
          
          He looks up into the tree. The hanging tendrils undulate
          softly. It's easy to imagine a presence.
          
                              JAKE
                    If Grace is there with you -- look in her
                    memories -- she can show you the world we
                    come from. There's no green there. They
                    killed their Mother, and they're gonna do
                    the same thing here.
          
          FROM UP IN THE TREE, looking down.   WOODSPRITES float in
          silence, moving around aimlessly.
          
                              JAKE
                    More Sky People are gonna come. They're
                    gonna come like a rain that never ends --
          
          Neytiri approaches silently behind him, listening.
          
                              JAKE
                    -- until they've covered the world.
                    Unless we stop them.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                      129.
          
                              JAKE (cont'd)
                    Look, you chose me for somethin'. And
                    I'll stand and fight, you know I will.
                    But I could use a little help here.
          
          Jake senses Neytiri and turns.
          
                              NEYTIRI
                    Our Great Mother does not take sides.
                    She protects only the balance of life.
          
          She comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his.
          
                              JAKE
                    It was worth a try.
          
          They lean in, foreheads touching, bodies pressed together.
          Holding each other -- in this, the last moment of peace.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          TIGHT ON a turbine as it starts to turn. Its RISING WHINE
          carries over --
          
          A SERIES OF RHYTHMIC CUTS:
          
          MAGAZINES are slammed into automatic weapons. AMMO BELTS are
          fed into rotary cannons. MISSILES are attached to gunship
          stub-wings.
          
          TIGHT ON BLUE HANDS sharpening wooden arrows.   Stringing
          bows. Cinching direhorse harnesses.
          
          TROOPERS DROP into ampsuit cockpits. PILOTS close gunship
          canopies. TROOPERS run up shuttle ramps.
          
          LONG LENS STACK, tight and abstract on gunships as they rise
          in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor
          wash.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST/ AERIAL - DAWN
          
          WIDE SHOT -- TILTROTORS fill the sky. Deadly armored beetles.
          
          The DRAGON leads the formation, flanked by SCORPIONS. Behind
          that is a wave of SAMSONS, and last, the two enormous
          VALKYRIE shuttles, packed with troops and ampsuits.
          
          INSIDE THE DRAGON, Quaritch surveys his armada as they skim
          over the tree tops.
          
          THEY SWEEP toward the Hallelujah mountains in a thundering
          wave.
          
                                                                     130.
          
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL - DAWN
          
          SQUADRONS OF BANSHEES darken the sky in waves, led by a
          single GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Jake sits astride his mount,
          flanked by Neytiri and Tsu'tey on their banshees.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN
          
          THE DRAGON DESCENDS on final approach to a large clearing --
          the LZ. The Samsons flair and touch down, disgorging troops,
          while the gunships hover protectively.
          
          THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets.
          They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons
          leveled, advancing in a cordon.
          
          UP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables.
          Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward,
          leading the army into the forest.
          
          LYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans
          his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display --
          ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Contact. Two hundred meters.
          
          A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest -- the ululating
          WAR CRIES of untold Na'vi. The troopers, look around,
          spooked. They can't tell where the sound is coming from.
          
          Then they feel it -- the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING.    They grip
          their weapons, bracing themselves as --
          
          THREE HUNDRED NA'VI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a
          full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an
          awesome sight.
          
          NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Na'vi hunters, carrying an
          assault rifle.
          
          THE NA'VI CHARGE thunders toward the human line.   The hunters
          raise their bows as --
          
          THE AMPSUITS raise their GAU-90's.
          
          ON THE THERMAL IMAGERS target-cursors track the ghost riders.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Fire for effect.
          
          The entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the
          jungle, blasting foliage into confetti.
          
                                                                      131.
          
          
          
          CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are
          flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are
          decimated as --
          
          RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their
          marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto.
          
          TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them
          like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit,
          FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blown-out canopy. Victory
          is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
          
          NORM'S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the
          creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as --
          
          A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut
          down. It SLAMS through an ampsuit's canopy but --
          
          THE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse.
          Riders pivot their mounts to flee and --
          
          THE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders
          scattering.
          
          LYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at
          moving targets.
          
          OVERHEAD, NA'VI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running
          along the branches.
          
          As the troopers advance into bow range, the NA'VI open fire
          and --
          
          TROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks -- the targets
          Jake taught them, but --
          
          THE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS.
          TRACERS rip through the foliage and --
          
          NA'VI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted
          off the limbs beneath their feet.
          
          NORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his
          HANDSET --
          
                               NORM
                    Jake!   Jake! We're falling back!
          
          SURVIVING NA'VI flee the horrific onslaught.   It is a total
          rout.
          
          IN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures
          streaming through the forest below.
          
                                                                      132.
          
          
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Blue team, switch forties.   Fire at will.
          
          Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm
          ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts.
          Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle --
          
          STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na'vi
          leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught.
          
          HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The
          downblast of the VALKYRIE'S lift jets shreds the forest.
          
          INSIDE THE SHUTTLE'S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are
          lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp.
          
          THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and --
          
          BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge
          hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out
          across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions.
          
          AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na'vi are
          blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves.
          
          IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five.
          
                                 TROOPERS
                    Yeah baby!     Get some!
          
          GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR's and GAU-
          90's.
          
          EXT. FLOATING MOUNTAINS - AERIAL
          
          Quaritch's fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of
          Truth.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Blue team, stay with the ground units.
                    Red team, with me. We're punching for
                    the main target.
          
          Quaritch glances up to see --
          
          A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare
          like birds of prey.
          
          CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as
          he leads the charge and --
          
          SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like
          falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined.
          
                                                                      133.
          
          
          
          JAKE'S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X
          shape just before --
          
          K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around
          the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE
          can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
          
          The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
          his canopy.   Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
          CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
          There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
          
          SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee
          riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
          
          JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
          cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.
          
          JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds
          splitting the air around him and --
          
          The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as
          they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive
          down into the trees.
          
          DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like
          Messerschmidts from a B-17 as --
          
          WE FOLLOW TSU'TEY'S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops
          in from its blind spot and --
          
          THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu'tey flashes past them,
          SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
          
          A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-to-
          air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
          
          WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
          dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
          and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
          smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.
          
          IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire --
          tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the
          stub-wing pods.
          
          NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her.   A Scorpion is
          right on her ass as --
          
          SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons
          Veritatis, then rolls out, zig-zagging through the dangling
          vines but --
          
                                                                     134.
          
          
          
          THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and
          tracers FLASH toward us as --
          
          SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but --
          
          HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
          launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
          The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
          shock wave.
          
          THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons
          Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot
          rolled up on their sides and --
          
          THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but --
          
          A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
          demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and --
          
          K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
          downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
          and teeth as they fall together out of control.
          
          Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
          breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
          
          FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
          This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
          breathing mask. The door gunners wave at --
          
          TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
          cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
          with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
          
          The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.
          
                              TRUDY
                    You're not the only ones with guns, you
                    pricks.
          
          NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
          her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
          trees, under the canopy.
          
          They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
          half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
          Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
          
          THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
          follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
          of blue-skinned figures.
          
          THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --
          
                                                                     135.
          
          
          
          The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT
          backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor.
          KABOOM!!
          
          NEYTIRI'S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a
          broken kite, crashing down through branches and --
          
          SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned.
          
          IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS.
          He taps the pilot and points --
          
                              QUARITCH
                    There it is.
                        (into his headset)
                    Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is
                    in sight.
          
          IN THE CARGO BAY of Valkyrie One, the troopers ready their
          deadly loads.
          
                              TROOPER
                    Target in sight.
          
          CIRCLING ABOVE, Tsu'tey falls in beside Jake, who talks to
          him by AIRCOM HEADSET.
          
                              JAKE
                    We have to stop the shuttles, no matter
                    what it takes.
          
          TSU'TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall
          in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but --
          
          A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as --
          
          TSU'TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
          and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
          
          GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
          the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
          
          TSU'TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His
          mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and --
          
          WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and --
          
          A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
          at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
          
          NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
          floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s
          rip the forest to shreds.
          
                                                                     136.
          
          
          
          Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar
          body mortally wounded as --
          
          HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and
          Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another
          magazine, panting in fear and pain as --
          
          AN AMPSUIT stomps up.    Aims its cannon point blank. B-BLAM!
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          The top of Norm's LINK bangs open. He reels out, collapsing
          onto the floor, clutching himself as if he can still feel the
          pain of death.
          
          He sits, huddled, shivering -- crazed.
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          TSU'TEY lies gasping, mortally injured. He looks up,
          grimacing, as an ampsuit looms over him.
          
          LYLE WAINFLEET reaches down and grabs Tsu'tey by his queue,
          lifting him painfully.
          
                                 WAINFLEET
                       I hear this is worse than death for you,
                       chief.
          
          WAINFLEET cuts Tsu'tey's queue off near the base. TSU'TEY
          SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload.
          Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu'tey's only
          connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.
          
          NEYTIRI -- bleeding, bruised -- staggers amid burning
          wreckage. AMPSUIT footsteps approach and she crouches behind
          a tree. Troopers are seconds from seeing her as --
          
          NEYTIRI knocks an arrow to HER FATHER'S BOW, and readies
          herself for a last kamikaze shot when --
          
          THE TROOPER on the far right of the firing line sees
          something on his screens.
          
                                 TROOPER
                       Right flank -- something's coming!   It's
                       all lit up out there.
          
          The troopers become aware of the GROUND SHAKING. A slow
          building thunderous ROAR and --
          
          AN AMPSUIT comes FLYING out of the trees, cartwheeling past
          them, and the SHAKING BUILDS --
          
                                                                      137.
          
          
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS
          
          Mo'at opens her eyes in sudden realization as --
          
          EXT. FOREST
          
          The troopers pivot to face --
          
          A WALL OF CHARGING HAMMERHEADS CRASHING out of the foliage in
          a shower of broken branches as --
          
          THE TROOPERS open fire but -- the stampede drives over them
          like a wave. Tree-trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits.
          Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated.
          
          NEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the
          gloom as --
          
          VIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers
          FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as
          their attackers.
          
          The survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of
          the shadows.
          
          JAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of rider-less WILD BANSHEES
          converge on Quaritch's ships. They literally darken the sky.
          
                              JAKE
                    What the hell -- ?
          
          The wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them.
          
          ON JAKE -- slowly getting it.   EYWA is in the fight.
          
                              JAKE
                    WHOO-HOOOO!
          
          A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH
          and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking
          him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot's windshield.
          
          NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in
          disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her.
          
          She senses something and turns slowly to see --
          
          A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening
          black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze--
          
          -- and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just
          above the ground. It holds that position -- waiting.
          
                                                                    138.
          
          
          
          Trembling, she approaches the waiting demon.
          
          EXT. FOREST
          
          A smoky hell. Fires burn all around. The troopers are
          disorganized, falling back. Shooting at shadows. Panicked
          yelling fills the comm freq.
          
          WAINFLEET and another AMPSUIT are charging together through
          the smoky gloom.
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I
                    want --
                        (screaming on the comm)
                    Who's screaming God damn it?!
          
                              TROOPER (ON RADIO)
                    We gotta get outta here! Whoever's in
                    charge, call for extraction!
          
                              WAINFLEET
                    Shutup you crybabies!
          
          SOMETHING slams into the other `suit, tackling it OUT OF
          FRAME. Wainfleet whirls to see his squad-mate missing. He
          moves through a screen of foliage to reveal --
          
          The AMPSUIT -- ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the
          cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see --
          
          A THANATOR LEAPING straight at him -- WAINFLEET raises his
          cannon but--
          
          WHAM!! It's on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon
          goes flying. He's face to face with its nightmare jaws,
          right outside his canopy--
          
          On its back is NEYTIRI, and it's a toss up which one looks
          more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling
          as it poises to strike and --
          
          K-KRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy.
          Wainfleet's SCREAM is brief.
          
          Neytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant ROAR echoes
          through the forest.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          Max runs down the hall, leading the other scientists.   He's
          yelling into an AIRCOM HANDSET --
          
                                                                   139.

                           (to the scientists)

          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          The door is hurled open and the SCIENTISTS charge in.
          
          Science geeks barricade the door as AVATAR-DRIVERS scramble
          into their link units, pulling the clamshells down.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR
          
          Max checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a
          connecting corridor.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. SHACK
          
          HUMAN NORM emerges from the airlock, wearing breathing gear
          and carrying an AR. He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL
          
          JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at
          the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged
          creatures.
          
          THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na'vi
          hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves,
          overwhelming the troopers.
          
          HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in.
          They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and
          troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage.
          
          The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to
          close, a second before he is cut down by a spear.
          
          JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He
          swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and
          lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as --
          
          GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them
          with his AR, still running forward and --
          
          JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the
          pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of
          the VTOL turbofans as --
          
          HIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and --
          
                                                                      140.
          
          
          
          HE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the
          turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and --
          
          JAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and
          reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire
          BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle.
          
          ON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping.
          
                               PILOT
                     Mains to a hundred percent!   Get me
                     airspeed!
          
          The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and --
          
          The FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward.    It
          still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until --
          
          IT'S CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational
          lift to fly and --
          
          THE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose.
          
                               PILOT
                     We're good!
          
          BEHIND HIM, a surviving Na'vi hunter runs forward and --
          
          THOONK!   ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots' necks and chests.
          
          THE SHUTTLE CLIMBS out of control, at full acceleration. It
          SLAMS into the underside of MONS Veritatis. It EXPLODES, and
          hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest.
          
          ON THE FLIGHT DECK of the other SHUTTLE, the pilots watch the
          wreckage falling.
          
                               PILOT
                     Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any
                     of ya'll want to get off this piece of
                     shit planet, you better cover our ass,
                     `cause we're the only way back to orbit.
          
                               GUNSHIP PILOT
                     Roger that.
          
          FROM THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches the shuttle bank
          away, with most of the remaining gunships following.
          
                               QUARITCH
                     Get back here you worthless pukes!
          
                                                                     141.
          
          
          
                              PILOT
                    Are we breaking off?
          
          Quaritch draws his pistol.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    What do you think?
          
          He is over the edge-- no logic in his brain now.   Only death.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER/CORRIDOR
          
          Techs and troopers crowd around consoles, listening to all
          the yelling and confusion as they try to plot the
          disintegrating battle.
          
                              SELFRIDGE
                        (in growing alarm)
                    What the hell is going on out there?
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST
          
          Regular troopers and volunteers FLEE through the jungle,
          scrambling to board SAMSONS as they touch down.
          
          INT. DRAGON COCKPIT
          
          The pilot listens to comms from Hell's Gate.
          
                              PILOT
                    Sir, all ground units are falling back to
                    the LZ.
          
          Quaritch's jaw clenches.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Stay on target.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS
          
          Mo'at LOOKS UP as the DRAGON appears over the trees like the
          shadow of Death. Around her, the Na'vi mothers clutch their
          children to them. We see AKWEY'S BOY among them.
          
          INT. DRAGON COCKPIT
          
          Quaritch sets the target cursor on the MOTHER TREE and what
          we recognize is the ghostly figure of Mo'at.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Switch missiles. Arm all pods.
          
                                                                      142.

                                QUARITCH
                      Let's see what these blue bastards do
                      when I bitch-slap their goddess.
          
          EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL
          
          JAKE'S LEONOPTERYX drops toward the Dragon like a Mig 29.     He
          pulls out, skimming over the ship. Uncoupling, he rolls
          backward off his mount and --
          
          JAKE HITS, skidding, on the hull of the Dragon. He rolls to
          his feet, already running as --
          
          QUARITCH sees the leonopteryx WHOOSH overhead and flap away
          with no rider. He snap-looks aft to see --
          
          JAKE SPRINTING along the spine of the ship, yanking two
          grenades from his battle-harness, pulling the pins with his
          teeth, then --
          
          QUARITCH's hand shoots out and SLAMS the pilot's CYCLIC STICK
          hard over. THE DRAGON lurches sideways, rolling sharply with
          a ROAR of protesting rotors and --
          
          JAKE IS FLUNG off his feet. The grenades miss the TURBINE
          INTAKES. One bounces off the ship. The other lodges against
          a cowling and --
          
          JAKE SLIDES OFF the ship, falling as -- K-BLAM! The grenade
          blows a two meter hole in the hull --
          
          WHOOOSHH!   Pandoran air swirls inside.
          
                                QUARITCH
                          (to the pilot)
                      Put your mask on.
          
          Quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as --
          
          JAKE GRABS the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over
          open space.
          
          HOLDING HIS BREATH, Quaritch blows a RESCUE HATCH and leans
          outside. Jake sees him aim his massive PISTOL.
          
          K-WHAM! K-WHAM! Rounds clang next to Jake's head. He LETS GO,
          plummeting into the trees --
          
          Jake plunges through jungle canopy. He catches a HUGE LEAF,
          as Neytiri taught him -- it bends down, breaking his fall --
          
                                                                     143.
          
          
          
          HE LETS GO, dropping again only to catch ANOTHER LEAF, and
          then another, and --
          
          WE RUSH DOWN with him through this green blur.   Jake drops to
          the ground in a feral crouch. Unhurt.
          
                              JAKE
                        (into his headset)
                    Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of
                    Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him,
                    anybody that can! Do it now!
          
          IN HER SAMSON Trudy Chacon is all business.
          
                              TRUDY
                    On it.
          
          SHE BANKS hard, pulling g's, coming around on the Dragon.
          She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight
          at the WARSHIP.
          
          QUARITCH, DRILLS a stream of tracers at her, tearing through
          her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage.
          
          IN THE JUNGLE BELOW, Norm watches her kamikaze run --
          
                              NORM
                    No!
          
                              TRUDY
                        (clipped, pilot-like)
                    Norm, I love you.
          
          TRUDY DIVES, raking through treetops and then, at the last
          instant, YANKS BACK on the stick and --
          
          THE SAMSON leaps straight up and -- K-KRASH!! SHEARS OFF THE
          COCKPIT of the Dragon as --
          
          QUARITCH THROWS HIMSELF aft along the aisle and --
          
          TRUDY'S SAMSON disintegrates, the wreckage burning as it
          tumbles into the jungle.
          
          MILES QUARITCH grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open
          front of the fuselage. Wind howls through wreckage where the
          pilot used to be. The forest rushes up to meet him and --
          
          THE DRAGON CRASHES through splintering trees, IMPACTING in a
          lake with a WHITE BLAST of water.
          
                                                                      144.
          
          
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          Norm takes a few steps and drops to his knees.    Imploded by
          grief.
          
          INT. OPS CENTER/ HELL'S GATE
          
          ON THE PLOTTING DISPLAY as Quaritch's TRANSPONDER ICON
          disappears.
          
                                TROOPER
                      Dragon is down. It's off the board.
          
                                SELFRIDGE
                      What do you mean, off the board?!
          
          Selfridge is stunned.    Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes
          them all look up.
          
          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH-
          CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever
          forward --
          
                                 SELFRIDGE
                      Oh shit.
          
          Selfridge DIVES as --
          
          K-RASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASH-CUTTER tear
          through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms
          go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of
          glass and shredded debris.
          
          The slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE
          through the gaping hole into the Ops Center --
          
          The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down
          at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are
          holding the Ops Center.
          
          Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask.   In
          shock. How could this be happening?
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. LAKE
          
          THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape
          rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face
          bloody, his eyes burning.
          
          He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides
          into the forest.
          
                                                                      145.
          
          
          
          QUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle.    He
          sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK.
          
          INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a
          window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing.
          
          QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to
          the firing button--
          
          WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
          
          Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses
          Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its
          razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
          
          THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long
          burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which
          SHRIEKS but --
          
          NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock,
          tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but --
          
          Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost
          crushing Neytiri.
          
          CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE
          and --
          
          QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the
          thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips
          on top of it, stabbing.
          
          QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning
          Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped.
          
          Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him,
          panting, scared but defiant.
          
                              JAKE (O.S.)
                    It's all over Quaritch --
          
          Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The
          `suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    Nothing's over while I'm breathing.
          
                              JAKE
                    Kinda hoped you'd say that.
          
          QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the
          broken CANNON as --
          
                                                                      146.
          
          
          
          Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries,
          blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit
          can move and --
          
          K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy,
          crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with
          the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash
          and --
          
          SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again
          -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.
          
          QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away.
          Jake rolls just before --
          
          THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He
          scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --
          
          JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the
          canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks.
          Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --
          
          INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the
          shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks.
          The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --
          
          FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing
          it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.
          
          INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --
          
          P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air.
          Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to
          pick up his KNIFE.
          
          NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs
          free from underneath three tons of thanator.
          
          QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.
          
                              QUARITCH
                    How does it feel to betray your own race?
          
          Then, inexplicably, he TURNS.   Walks away.
          
          FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us
          and --
          
          CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the
          window. He is reaching inside for the Link when --
          
          JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he
          has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --
          
                                                                      147.
          
          
          
          JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch's shoulder
          and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge
          of the cockpit but --
          
          QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake
          slams to the ground.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic
          Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.
          
          NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull
          her other leg out.
          
          THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and --
          
          JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of
          the attack drives him to his knees as --
          
          QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is
          pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
          
          INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay
          connected as --
          
          THE KNIFE reaches his throat as --
          
          THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest.   He looks up.
          
          NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
          she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
          
          TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
          
          QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
          the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
          laugh -- he dies.
          
          NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing
          Quaritch, she lowers her father's bow.
          
          JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and --
          
          INT. SHACK
          
          HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor
          where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws
          toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.
          
          He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.
          
          NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the
          debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's
          side -- puts the mask over his face and --
          
                                                                    148.
          
          
          
          JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri,
          studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for
          the first time.
          
          Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue
          of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask --
          together, separate. Worldless.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          MO'AT tends to the mortally wounded TSU'TEY as AVATAR JAKE
          arrives with Neytiri. Mo'at has bound his wounds, but by her
          expression, it is clear he cannot be saved.
          
          Jake kneels and Tsu'tey opens his eyes.   Through a haze of
          pain, he recognizes Jake.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                        (NA'VI)
                    I See you, Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                    I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    Are the people safe?
          
                              JAKE
                    They're safe.
          
          Tsu'tey weakly clutches his severed queue.
          
                               TSU'TEY
                    I can never ride again, or bond with my
                    woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can
                    not lead the People. You will lead them,
                    Jakesully.
          
                              JAKE
                    No. I'm not officer material.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    It is decided. Now do the duty of
                    Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free.
          
                              JAKE
                    I'm not killing you.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    I am already dead.
          
                                                                     149.
          
          
          
                              JAKE
                    No.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    It is the way. And it is good. I will be
                    remembered --
          
          Tsu'tey's voice is weak, but thick with emotion.
          
                              TSU'TEY
                    -- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were
                    brothers -- and he was my last shadow.
          
          TSU'TEY'S HAND clasps with Jake's in a fierce grip. Jake
          draws his knife.
          
          TSU'TEY'S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun.
          HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu'tey.
          
                              JAKE
                        (NA'VI)
                    Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the
                    Mother Spirit.
          
          By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu'tey's pain.
          Jake's eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the
          prayer for the dead, and his Na'vi words carry over as we --
                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. HELL'S GATE -DAY
          
          Na'vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell's
          Gate.
          
          Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats
          flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and
          the GATES are open to the forest.
          
                              JAKE (V.O.)
                    A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.
          
          Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR's as the
          personnel of Hell's Gate file up the cargo ramp of the
          remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry,
          like POW's.
          
          JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of
          the Sky People.
          
          PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes -- the eyes
          of a lost soul -- meet JAKE'S. He disappears into the ship.
                                                                 CUT TO:

          EXT. SPACE
          
          ISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of
          PANDORA. The ISV's antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it
          accelerates out of orbit.
          
          What remains IN FRAME is a virgin, primeval world. Spanning
          the black continents is a vast reticulated lace-work of
          BIOLUMINESCENCE -- a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora.
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
          
          The sun's rays shaft down through the layers of canopy.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       The forest will heal, and so will the
                       hearts of the People. New life keeps the
                       energy flowing, like the breath of the
                       world.
          
          NEYTIRI, obviously pregnant, is bow-fishing in the shallows.
          Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       This is my last videolog.
          
          INT. LINK ROOM
          
          VIDEO IMAGE -- Jake sits in a chair, talking straight TO
          CAMERA. He is thin, pale. He looks around the high tech room.
          
                                 JAKE
                       The science guys will keep the lights on,
                       here. But I won't miss this place.
          
          EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT
          
          THE WILLOWS glow softly. The entire Omaticaya clan is
          gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree.
          
                                 JAKE (V.O.)
                       I better wrap this up. There's a funeral
                       tonight, and I don't want to be late. It
                       was someone very close to me.
          
          WIDE SHOT, moving in across the concentric rings of people,
          all plugged-in and softly chanting. MOVING toward the
          center, over the figure of Mo'at, to hover above --
          
          NEYTIRI, kneeling beside two FIGURES on the dais --
          
                                                                     151.
          
          
          
          JAKE and his AVATAR lie head to head. Human Jake is wearing
          an exomask. Both figures are still, hands folded, covered in
          translucent silken shrouds of ROOT-CILIA.
          
          CAMERA CLOSES IN as Neytiri removes the mask from Jake's
          human face. She gently closes his dead eyes with her
          fingertips. Then bends and kisses him.
          
          MOVE INTO CU on AVATAR JAKE as Neytiri's hand comes into
          frame, stroking his cheek. TIGHTENING slowly to--
          
          ECU JAKE'S EYES. Hold a beat, then --
          
          They open.

					THE AVENGERS



				Screenplay by Don Macpherson



























					June 21, 1995







1	BLUE SKY WITH CLOUDS

	PAN DOWN to reveal:


2	EXT - SALTFLATS - DAY

	A flat horizon, stretching to infinity.

	A 360 degree pan reveals: nothing.  Deserted, no hiding places.  No animals, no
	humans, no objects.  Except in mid distance --


3	RED PHONE BOX

	brightly painted, traditional, comforting, belongs in a village green.  Perfectly
	ordinary -- except for its location.

	Silence.  Only the wind over the plain.  Except --

	The PHONE RINGS.

	RING-RING ... a mellow, old-fashioned tone.  We wait for someone to answer it.  But
	of course nothing and nobody for miles.  Except --


4	IN DISTANCE

	a CAR ENGINE ... A puff of smoke on the horizon ... VA-VA-VOOM of high geared
	acceleration, as INTO VIEW

	ZOOM! --


5	CAR	

	speeding like a bullet.  Driven at maximum, breakneck speed, 125 mph.  A petite open
	top '65 Lotus Elan, all streamlined curves, full throttle, it nears the phone box, and --

	SCREECHES to a halt.

	Dust clears, ENGINE NOISE FADES.  From the seat, hops --


6	KINKY BOOT

	in black leather.

	Buckled.  Strap at ankle.  Crunching into the ground.
	PAN UP TO:


7	BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

	late 20's.  In CLOSEUPS of -- Tight black leather catsuit.  A flash of auburn hair. 
	Black leather like a second skin.  Smoothed over legs, thighs.  Buckled at wrists, straps
	at ankles, zips --

	Pulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, invulnerable, cool.  Very
	cool.  She locks up at clouds in the sky.  Then steps across to the phone box.  Picks up
	the phone.

					EMMA
			How now brown cow ...
				(pause)
			The rain in Spain falls mainly
			on the plain ...
				(pause)
			The quick brown fox jumped over
			the lazy --

	From the receiver, an irritated official voice.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Password affirmative. Thank you,
			Doctor.

	Emma puts down receiver.  Hangs a cardboard outside the phone box.  Then presses
	button bakelite box.

	A second's wait.  A coin from the slot.  Then a HUM as --


8	INSIDE PHONE BOX

	the floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the box, a notice
	now reads "Out of Order."

	Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84
	miles."


9	INT.  LABORATORY

	underground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi
	tech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von
	Braun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel
	Only." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud.


10      FROM AIRLOCK DOOR

	A man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  Early 40's, handsome,
	charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.

					PETER
			Ready, darling?

	Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.  She
	smiles.

					EMMA
			Ready as I'll ever be ...

	Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they walk down:


11      LONG CORRIDOR

	air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth --

	A man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.  On his name
	tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.

	In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab

					VALENTINE
			Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... 
			Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module 
			set ... Temperature control on course between 
			one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...

					PETER
			Anything else?

	Valentine smiles, shrugs --

					VALENTINE
			Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

					EMMA
			Thanks, Valentine ...

	Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

	A shy look from Valentine at Emma.  Peter senses

					PETER
			Just a minute, darling. My brother's a 
			worry wart. I better have a word ...
			Valentine --

	Peter takes Valentine over to one side.  Emma checks gauges and dials.  Behind her a
	conversation.  Peter returns.

	He takes a ring from his finger --


12      CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM

	on a gold ring.


13      BACK TO SCENE

	He slips it onto her finger.

					PETER
			Something to remember me by.

	Peter smiles.  The remark strikes Emma as curious.  But no time to query.  She smiles
	back.  He gives her a kiss --

					PETER
				(checks his watch)
			See you in an hour ...

					EMMA
			One sunny day ...

	The countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.


14      IN DISTANCE

	Valentine watches her.


15      INT.  LAB CHAMBER

	Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive
	thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

	The effect is very cold.  Frozen.  Numb.  Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty
	entombed and sealed in a glass coffin.  Plunged down into a vault.  Opposite her --

	In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.


16      FROM EMMA'S POV

	The sound of their HEARTBEATS.  Their BREATHING.  BLEEP and PULSE OF
	ELECTRONICS.  Thru glass and leather.  Like cerebral sex.  Technological, erotic.
	Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as --


17      UP IN CONTROL ROOM

	Valentine watches behind glass.  Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.  He attends to
	dials.  And to his female assistant --

					VALENTINE
				(thrilled)
			Readings still normal ...

	The assistant smiles oddly.  FOCUS ON --

	An insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404."  A replicant.
	They monitor screens.  A DULL HUM.


18      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	A weather antenna emerges from the ground:  an enigmatic phallic silver blob, like a
	Koons sculpture.  The sun glints off it ...


19      DOWN BELOW

	A temperature gauge rises.

	The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red.  Starts to heat
up     as if --

	It soaks up temperature:  from cold to hot in instants.


20      CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL

	"CUMULUS COLLECTOR." The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a
	MURMUR, a BREATH.  As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises

	The gloved  hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.

	Suddenly a BLIP.  Something wrong.


21      DOWN IN HIS VAULT

	Peter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --

					PETER
				(intercom cutting out)
			Losing control -- malfunction
			in thermal chamber -- for Christ's
			-- Emm --!


22      IN CONTROL ROOM

	Needles push off the dials, as --

	The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten
	metal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's eyes widen in alarm ...

					COUNTDOWN (V.O.)
			Five -- four --  three -- two --
			one ... Three -- two -- one ...
				(repeating)
			Three -- two -- one ...


23      INSIDE COFFIN

	Peter's glass cracks

	The emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants running ...


24      IN HER COFFIN

	Emma realizes; looks to Peter --


25      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	The "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue
	sky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into


26      INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic stations! Valentine looks
	aghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, over the intercom --

					VALENTINE
			Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!

	FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as

					VALENTINE
			Emma ...


27      FROM HER VAULT

	Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod


28      ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)

	Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a
	nightmare --


29      BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma!


30      RAPID INTERCUTS

	The purple smoke enveloping Peter's	pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within,
	looking at Emma --

					EMMA
			Peter!

	Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She
	grabs, claws on glass --

	Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod
	cover, it --

	Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as
	behind her

					VALENTINE
			Don't wait for him -- he's not --

	Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove --
	twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as:


31      ABOVE GROUND

	The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!


32      CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING

	gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass --


33      BACK TO SCENE

					PETER
				(faint)
			Emma ... Emma ...

	As a GROWLING sound grows till

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision
	separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma.


34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)	

	The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating
	backwards in --

	A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control,
	weightless, powerless, as --

	The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void
	opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --

	An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new
	version of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE --

	CREDITS SEQUENCE.


35      SERIES OF SHOTS

	In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space
	
	An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --

	A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts
	of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over --

	A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad 
	body --

	In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  Flashes of: 
	hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut.

	A thorned stem, sharp to the touch --

	FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black
	and white of a chessboard as ...

	A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --

	A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed
	back - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ...

	A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie --
	umbrella stabs like a sword --

	Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and
	tossed into --

	His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
	Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --

	Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
	Then --

	PISTOL SHOTS OVER as:


36      INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

	A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots,
	naked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus
	Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair.

	Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.

	Same every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel.
	From outside ANOTHER SHOT ...

	Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --


37      HER POV

	a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The
	damn thing BACKFIRES again ...


38      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma frowns, annoyed.


39      EXT.  STREETS - DAWN

	Zoom!  The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets.  Inside is a
	bowler-hatted man --

	JOHN STEED, late 30's.  Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes.  A
	Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat.
	A debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- hard-edged,
	steely menace.  He drives through --

40      LONDON (1999)

	This is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, forever England.
	Bright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in final decadent bloom.  White stucco
	buildings. Regency style in candy colors.  A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier
	version of the 60's preserved in aspic, where --

	Over the RADIO, a plummy voice:

					ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... The War Office today approved military 
			expenditure for the nation's new defense alert 
			system. A spokesman  said he would raise the 
			matter at the forthcoming World  Council of 
			Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was 
			still necessary in the uncertain climate.

	As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does
	not intrude.  No traffic.  No extras.  Nothing to spoil the view.

	As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --


41      EXT.  STEED'S GARAGE - DAWN	

	Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --


42      INT.  STEED'S FLAT - DAWN

	but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.

	A large bachelor's den.  Dark wood, leather armchairs ...

	Steed enters his library from a concealed door --
	Titles on wine and birdwatching.  He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet. Pours
	a brandy.  Hears a noise ...

	Instantly on guard.  In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.  Steed peers 'round a
	corner.  Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar?
	Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --

	Crack!  Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.  Who manages to dodge,
	swivel 'round, and --

	Bam!  Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.  A rapid exchange of blows.  Steed
	recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --

	His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam! a
	spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they
	freeze.

	Steed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather.

					STEED
			Brenda -- ?


43      FROM ABOVE HIM

	a voice --

					MOTHER (O.S.)
			Steed -- ?!


44      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling
	inches before him --

	Pommaded hair, fat, dandyish:  MOTHER, head of secret services; hands of extendable
	metal hooks.  And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard.  Who smiles
	seductively.

					STEED
			Mother. I thought you were burglars.

					MOTHER
			Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

	Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.

					BRENDA
			See how you're getting on ...

					STEED
			Something in the wind?

	Mother wheels himself from the study.  Taps a barometer.  It whirls around.

					MOTHER
			Weather's turning nasty.

					STEED
			You didn't come to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh yes I did. I want you to meet
			somebody.
				(off Steed's look)
			I expect you'll like her.

	Brenda coolly files her nails.  A flash of jealousy.

					STEED
			'Her'?


45      INT.  EMMA'S FLAT (PRIMROSE HILL) - DAY

	A groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).  Bach PIANO MUSIC floats in the
	air.

	Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.  On the piano, a framed
	picture of her late husband.  And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine.

	A KNOCK.  Emma gets up, goes to the door.  The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, keys
	jumping up and down automatically, as --


46      AT DOOR

	Emma flicks open a large automated eye.  Peers thru.  Opens


47      IN CORRIDOR

	A MESSENGER (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow.

					MESSENGER
			Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you ...

	Emma shuts the door.  Unties the bow, opens up  Finds an embossed card:

					EMMA
				(reads)
			'Please answer the Telephone.'

	Emma looks: The phone sits there.

	Just then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message,
	an upper-class woman's voice:

					WOMAN (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m.
			Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club,
			the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
			Steed ...

	BEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace of kippers.
	Puzzled, she holds up a fish.

					EMMA
			Kippers ...?


48      EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY

	Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car
	conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15.
	Out gets --

	-- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, "Boodles
	Gentlemen's Club."  She goes in, passing --

	-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire.


49      INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised.

					PORTER
			May I help you, madam ...

					EMMA
			Mr. John Steed, please.

					PORTER
			I'm afraid that's impossible.

					EMMA
			Impossible?

	The Porter points to a notice:  "No non-members.  No animals.  No women."

					PORTER
			You are female?

					EMMA
			As you see.

					PORTER
			Then you can't come in.

					EMMA
			I have an appointment.

					PORTER
			No women. Not in Boodles. Not
			since 1922.

					EMMA
			Really -- what happened in 1922?

	Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead
	politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave.

	The Porter rushes up to restrain her.

	Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. 
	The Porter winces and --

					EMMA
			Thank you so much. I can find Mr.
			Steed myself ...

	-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors,
	upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into


50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY

	Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room

	Steed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees --

	Emma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction.

					STEED
			Doctor Peel, I presume?

					EMMA
			And you must be Steed. Please
			don't get up.

	He doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study.

					STEED
			I was about to throw in the towel.

					EMMA
			I had a spot of bother at the door.

					STEED
			I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman
			inside Boodles since --

					EMMA
			1922. Why the kippers?

					STEED
			Red herring would have been too
			obvious, don't you think?

					EMMA
				(looks around)
			So what was all this -- some sort
			of test?

					STEED
			Congratulations, you've penetrated a 
			bastion of male privilege. I guessed 
			you weren't a stickler for Tradition, 
			doctor.

					EMMA
			Whereas you are.

					STEED
			Dyed in the wool. But I can admire 
			someone who doesn't play by the 
			rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					STEED
			Not by me. Play by the rules,
			Doctor, or the game is nothing.

					EMMA
			And just what is the game?

					STEED
			I say, this is all terribly formal.  
			Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
				(re:  the steamroom) 
			Under the circumstances, you may 
			call me Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Much better.

					EMMA
			And now that we've settled the matter 
			of honorifics, will you kindly explain 
			why you wished me to meet you?

					STEED
			I didn't. Mother did.

					EMMA
			Mother?

	Steed steps closer, smiling.

					STEED
			I expect you'll like him.

	Off Emma's reaction --


51      EXT.  THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY

	CAR ROAR OVER.  Down the embankment Parliament and Big Ben in b.g., the sleek
	Jaguar zooms at 60mph.  Steed dodges traffic --

	Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down --

	Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians,
	HONKING his HORN.  Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.  Steed turns
	charmingly.

					STEED
			Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't
			be late.
				(beat)
			A word of warning. Don't take the
			macaroon. Mother's favorite.

	Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the
	riverbank.  He pulls up before a sign:

			RIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
					No Admittance

	At a control barrier Steed inserts a card.  Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top
	Priority Clearance Only."  The barrier lifts.  She looks again at Steed, reappraising him
	as Big Ben approaches four.  The car disappears in darkness ...

52      LARGE WINDOW CURTAIN

	opens, revealing water!  We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish float past a
	window of reinforced glass.  An original Campbell's tomato soup can floats down as we
	WIDEN to reveal ...

53      INT. SECRET SERVICE HQ - UNDERWATER - DAY

	Mother in his wheelchair, pulling the curtain cord.

					MOTHER
			That's better. I much prefer a
			womb with view, don't you, Mrs.
			Peel?

	A delicate CLOCK on the mantel CHIMES FOUR.

	Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle.

					MOTHER
			Shall I be mother?

	He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web, known as The
	Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels.

	Catches Emma's wandering lock

					MOTHER
			I expect you're wondering where
			you are.

	An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -- Emma takes
	her tea ...

					EMMA
			Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret 
			service. You're so hushhush, even the 
			legit secret service knows nothing about 
			it. Am I right?

	Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming with fancies
	over to Emma and Steed.

					MOTHER
			Close. We're so hush-hush, even
			we know nothing about it.
				(before Emma can
				make sense of this) 
			Now let's see, there's coconut cake, 
			date and walnut; I recommend the 
			rum baba ...

					EMMA
			Hmmm ...

					MOTHER
			Looks like rain, Steed...

					STEED
			... Showers followed by sunny periods.

					EMMA
				(looks up from
				trolley)
			We're not here to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh, yes we are.

					BRENDA
				(to Emma, cunning)
			Macaroon?

	Emma hesitates; takes a cake.  About to take a bite, when --

	Mother switches off lights.  A screen drops, covering the water window as the mood
	changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient PROJECTOR RATTLES on ...

54      IN DARKNESS

	Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the
	English countryside:

					MOTHER
			We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.  
			We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into 
			the field for data. Case number one: 
			April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins 
			investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.  
			A field outside the village of Little Snoring, 
			one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped 
			by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death 
			in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in 
			perma-frost.
				(the picture changes)
			Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M. 
			Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, 
			investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak 
			rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a 
			flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five 
			inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size 
			of a cricket pitch ...
				(the picture changes)
			... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief 
			Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip 
			field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins 
			recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, 
			temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous 
			combustion. Not much of him left ...

	CLICK.  The lights go back on.  Emma notices - a new arrival
	
	a tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.

					MOTHER
			My number two. Special assignments.  
			She's --

					EMMA
			Let me guess -- 'Father'?

					FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)
			All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.

	Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.  Runs her fingers over Emma's face. 
	Gets the outline.  Emma realizes --

					EMMA
			You're --

	Blind ... Father smiles.

					FATHER
			God, you're quick.

					MOTHER
			Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --

	He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed investigates a
	pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.  The shoes have agent Simkins' name
	in them ...

					STEED
			Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My
			shoemaker.

					EMMA
				(unimpressed)
			A kipper. Or a red herring? What were 
			they investigating?

					FATHER
			A series of bizarre shifts in local weather 
			patterns ...

					STEED
			Global warming?

					FATHER
			Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush 
			English village transformed overnight 
			into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

					EMMA
			How curious ...

					MOTHER
			Something strange is happening. And 
			whoever knows about it doesn't want 
			us to find out.

					FATHER
				(to Steed)
			Your mission is simple. Find out
			how and why these agents died.

					EMMA
			I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

					MOTHER
			Your research into climate engineering was 
			state-of-the-art. Your experiments could 
			have revolutionized our knowledge of global 
			warming -- had they succeeded. We need 
			your expertise.

					STEED
			Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor 
			again, Mrs. Peel --

	Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ...

					EMMA
			I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.  
			I've been out of action for some time. I'll 
			consider your proposal.

	She gets up, ready to go.

					FATHER
			One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another 
			special reason we wanted you to join our 
			happy family; rather curious, actually ...

	Mother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification,
	identikit sketches.

					MOTHER
			Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.  
			One description tallied in all three places.  
			Recognize her?

	Emma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts.

					EMMA
			Me, isn't it?

	Emma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister.

					FATHER
			Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.  
			With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

					EMMA
			You're saying I have no choice.

					MOTHER
			Father will be your controller. Steed here 
			will show you the ropes.

					EMMA
				(very arch)
			Ropes?


55      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ SHOOTING GALLERY

	A life-size target of a man with blank face, bowler hat and umbrella, flips up, and --

	BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!  Is riddled with holes by

Emma, who works at reloading as


56      HIGH ABOVE IN ONE-WAY MIRRORED GALLERY

	looking on, Mother with Steed.

					STEED
			Think she really killed those agents?

					MOTHER
			She may not know. Theory goes she
			may be very ill.

					STEED
			Amnesia?

					MOTHER
			Possibly. Split personality ...

					STEED
			Insane ... ?

					MOTHER
			Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, 
			you should watch out.

					STEED
			Why?

					MOTHER
			She may try to kill you.


57      IN SHOOTING GALLERY

	Emma swiftly turns, aims, and --

	BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision. 
	All on target.  Steed reacts.  Ulp.

					STEED
			Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. 
			Darling.

58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM

	A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie
	(1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed. 
	The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show.

	As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a
	kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard,
	Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air.

					DR. DARLING
			One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
			she's obsessively devoted to the memory 
			of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. 
			You may find her a little ... remote.

	Images of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him.

					DR. DARLING
			They were a team. Met at Cambridge. 
			Working on a top secret research mission 
			into weather conditions, code name The
			Prospero Project, when Peel died.

	Steed looks meaningfully at Mother.

					MOTHER
			Something went wrong. System malfunction.  
			Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.  
			Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File 
			still open.

					STEED
			How come you took so much interest
			in her, Dr. Darling?

					DR. DARLING
			Her husband was one of ours.

					STEED
				(eyes Peel's photo,
				then Mother)
			Peel? Did she know?

					MOTHER
			Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She 
			was in a dangerous game, Steed. High 
			stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If 
			she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

					STEED
			Anyone particular in mind?

					MOTHER
			You.

	OFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ...


59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON

	Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she does, Emma is a
	champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech 
	dueling ...

	Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black ... yin and yang ...

					STEED
			You're a lady of hidden talents,
			Mrs. Peel ...

	Tic-tac ...

					EMMA
			I've no intention of hiding them ...

	Tic-tac ...

					STEED
			Scientist ...
				(tic-tac)
			... marksman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... swordsman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... To what do you attribute your 
			overachievements?

	Fast swordplay.  Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic.  Steed's good, too.

					EMMA
			My father always wanted a boy.

					STEED
			Really?  I fail to see the connection.

					EMMA
			I had a feeling you would. Touche!

	She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest.  BUZZ!  Steed removes
	his mask; holds her foil tip.

					STEED
			I take your point.

	Emma takes off her mask.

					EMMA
			Do you?

					STEED
			Yes indeed. I need protection.


60      EXT.  SIGN - DAY

	"Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756."  Steed's Jag parked in front -- of course
	there's a space.  Getting out

					EMMA
			I thought we were on our way.

					STEED
			Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man 
			worth meeting. No point setting out 
			half shod.

					EMMA
				(dry)
			Or half cocked.

61      CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW

	slips Steed's hand-made shoes an.  The "lasts" shapes of shoes beside him -- bear
	Steed's name.

					STEED
			I couldn't agree more. Thank you, 
			Trubshaw.

					TRUBSHAW
				(significantly)
			Very good, Mr. Steed.

	WIDEN to reveal:


62      INT.  TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY

	A bull moose's antlers.  A horned rhino.  A Leopard.  A tiger.  Then next to them, in a
	wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently beneath them.  Shop assistants attend
	in tails and wing-collars, very old school tie.  Steed emerges helped into a new flashy
	waistcoat ...

					EMMA
				(gags at the waistcoat)
			Steed, we really must be --

					STEED 
				(relishing his shoes)
			Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a 
			hand-made shoe. As unique as a face 
			or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?


63      BEHIND DISPLAY

	Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise ...

					EMMA
			You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

					STEED
			Thank you, Trubshaw ...

	A youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, smart suit, druggy
	high-pitched giggle.  BAILEY, a cocky, cool psychopath.  He watches Steed and
	Emma leave ...

	... and saunters after them ...  CAR ROAR OVER.


64      EXT.  LONDON STREETS - DAY

	as the Jag races through them, heading for the country.

					EMMA (V.O.)
			That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Do you really think so?

	Another car follows them ... as they pass Buckingham Palace, now painted pink and
	guarded by female grenadiers ...

65      SIGN

	reading:  "Scotland" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the Jag ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Press that button, would you?
			Tea?

66      CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT

	opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-warmed pot,
	pouring into two china cups ...

	WIDEN to reveal:

67      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar ...

					STEED
			Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt
			your flow of oratory ...


	Steed's JAG BACKFIRES again as at the beginning ...

					EMMA
			You know what I mean. This car
			-- and you. Nobody walks around
			like that. Milk?

					STEED
			Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.
			Peel. No thank you.

	She hands over a cup.

					EMMA
			But why? What's the point?

					STEED
			A Gentleman has to have a code.
			This is part of mine. A uniform.
			Think of it as my suit of shining
			armor.

					EMMA
			And I suppose you're the knight.

					STEED
			The most unpredictable piece on
			the board. And always ready to
			protect his queen.

					EMMA
			That's predictable. When I find
			a queen in need of protection
			I'll let you know.

	Steed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing?

					STEED
			I'm hoping you will.

	He puts his foot down.  Zoom ...


68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Towards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ...


69      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma consults a list, reads --

					EMMA
			Sir August Merryweather ... why
			are we seeing him first?

					STEED
			As per mother's instructions.

					EMMA
			Do we always follow Mother's
			instructions?

					STEED
			For a man in my position --

					EMMA
			Just what is your position, if you don't 
			mind my asking.  How did a stuffed 
			shirt like you get into this line of work?

					STEED
				(smiles)
			They call me in when they've reached a 
			dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

					EMMA
			I have no choice. Why should you
			risk your life?

					STEED
			After our fencing match, I was rather 
			hoping you would do the risking.  
			More tea?

					EMMA
			No thanks.

					STEED
			I meant me.

	Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours.


70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY

	The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car.

					STEED (V.O.)
			According to Mother, Sir August owns 
			half of the Highlands. A millionaire.  
			Former head of Special Projects at the 
			Ministry. Now ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			An eccentric recluse?


71      INT.  JAG - DAY

					STEED
			Not so much eccentric. More barking 
			mad. He has a wife called June. And 
			a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

					EMMA
			June, July ... August?

					STEED
			The family does seem to be somewhat 
			meteorologically inclined.

					EMMA
			Any other vices?

					STEED
			All of a piece, really. A fanatical 
			weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.
				(off her look)
			British Royal Organisation For
			Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British 
			weather has been tampered with 
			by ... aliens.

	Emma takes this in.

					EMMA
			So ... I distract him while you snoop 
			around? How?

					STEED
			Small talk.  Try the weather.


72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

	Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates

	Signs:  "Private: No Admittance."  Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded
	rifles.  They start up the drive ...

	Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails.

	One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a
	CAMERA ...

	The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them.


73      INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

	On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES
	on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal:

	A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor --

	-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit
	with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor.

					EMMA
			Original ...

					BUTLER
			This way, miss ...

					EMMA
			Missus ...

	He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into


74      INT.  A LARGE ROOM

	of semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls lined with display
	cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.  A thermometer reads:

	100 degrees with high humidity. The Butler leaves.

	Emma fans herself.  Nobody in the roam.  But hears a sound of RAINFALL from a
	smoked glass conservatory.

					EMMA
			Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Eh? In here!

	Emma follows the SOUND, steps cautiously forward.

75      INT.  CONSERVATORY

	beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain, an old man splashes in bizarre rubber togs.
	Emma stays cool.

					EMMA
			I've come to apply for membership
			in Brolly --

					SIR AUGUST
				(shouts above the tempest)
			You don't get rain like you used to in 
			England. A good shower that's the ticket.  
			Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells 
			the namby-pamby in a man.

	SIR AUGUST steps out of the shower and wind machine.  A belted rubber macintosh,
	flippers, goggles.  He starts to disrobe, the NOISE DIES DOWN --

					EMMA
			I so agree. How did you acquire a 
			taste for it?

					SIR AUGUST
			Out in India. So character-forming for the 
			British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The 
			rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen 
			inches overnight. A whole week of lovely 
			rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

	Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her.

					SIR AUGUST
			You

					EMMA
			Have we met?

					SIR AUGUST
			You mean you don't recall??

	Before Emma can reply, the door opens...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, Lady June ...

	Emma's attention switches to LADY JUNE, a buxom lady in a sou'wester and galoshes,
	who wheels in a tray of scones.

					LADY JUNE
			Dear August.  Loves his showers.
			Like a baby.
				(beat)
			Scones, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you, Lady -- June ...

	Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is rapidly 
	darkening ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

					EMMA
			Promised? Who promised?

					SIR AUGUST
			There, look!

	Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows.  Emma exchanges looks
	with June as the rain starts pouring.

					SIR AUGUST
			Imagine being caught out in a blow 
			like that!

76      EXT.  MOORLAND - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his umbrella; wanders
	over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:  "No Trespassers."  Rains more.  And more.
	Turns to a tempest, as --

					STEED
			I say, this is a bit much.

	Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill.  He looks over, peers through
	the mist at --

	A deep purple cloud.  Mushrooming towards him.

	Steed can't escape it.  It envelops him.  Starts to blink.  Cough.  Footsteps less sure. 
	Surrounded by thick purple haze

	Steed stumbles and falls

	Down a hill.  Tumbles to the bottom.  He knocks his head on a rock.  Steed blinks,
	shakes his head.  Eyes refocus.  He sees


77      UNDULATING SAND DUNES

	Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista.  Dead trees.  Suddenly Steed's in the
	Sahara.  A heat haze shimmers.

	Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees ...


78      IN DISTANCE - RED PHONE BOX

	Steed heads towards it.  The PHONE BOX seems further away.  Like an optical
	illusion.  Then hears RINGING.

	Steed still bowler-hatted.  Overcoat.  Perspiring.  Takes off bowler, wipes brow. 
	Adjusts rose in buttonhole.  It wilts.

	He arrives at the phone box. Opens the door.  Steed picks up the RINGING PHONE,
	listens to --

	A SCRATCHY ORCHESTRAL RECORDING of "The Merry Widow."

					STEED
			'The Merry Widow'...?

	Over the MUSIC, a strange --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the
			hell...? Who is this? ... You must
			leave the test area. I repeat,
			leave the area ... Help is on the
			way ...

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Steed is baffled.  Steps out, sees --


79      ON HORIZON

	a shimmering heat haze.  A figure on a camel moving towards them.  Steed watches
	amazed, as the camel pads closer ...

	The mirage arrives. The rider dismounts. A woman in yashmak and veils. She draws
	closer. Drops the veils to reveal --

	Emma Peel.  In her black leather catsuit.

					.STEED
			Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by. 
			And I see you're wearing your - 
			riding outfit?

	Emma moves closer.  Steed smiles at her.  Emma closer and -- chop! -- gives a kung-fu
	jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the stomach.  As Steed lies on the 
	ground --

					STEED
			Manners, Mrs. Peel.

	Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS --


80      EMMA'S POV

	-- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes
	close ...


81      EMMA

	moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good
	bye kiss.


82      STEED'S POV	82

	The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him.

									
		FADE TO BLACK.

	Sound of CLACKING ...

	FADE IN:

83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY

	A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her
	spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to

	Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very
	nonchalant.  Eating his grapes.

					STEED
			Ah, Brenda ...
				(as she leaves)
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			You should be dead.  How do you
			feel?

					STEED
				(eyes her)
			Strange.

					EMMA
			You were very lucky.  Four shots to 
			the heart. I found you after I slipped 
			away from Sir August. Mother brought 
			you here. Not me you should thank.

					STEED
			I wasn't about to.

					EMMA
			I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your
			bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought 
			you were just overdressed.

					STEED
			I might say the same.

84      FROM GALLERY

	Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. 
	But they both are wearing headphones.

					EMMA
			Mother and Dr. Darling have me 
			under observation. They think I 
			tried to kill you.

					STEED
			Why should they think that?

					EMMA
			You told them. You said I arrived 
			on a camel, shot you four times. 
			Left you for dead.

					STEED
			Frankly that's how I remember it.

					EMMA
			But that's absurd. I may not be 
			over-fond of you, Steed, but it's 
			not my style.

					STEED
			Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
			Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
				(conceding)
			That's possible. Sir August was convinced 
			he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.  
			Another odd thing. When it rained, he said 
			it was just as someone had promised.

					STEED
			Did he say who?

					EMMA
			No. But he must know. Incidentally, 
			my double left you with this.

	Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks
	puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by --

					STEED
			An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

					EMMA
			Did you say formal? I must dress.


85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT

	The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door.
	Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit --


86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL

	hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring --

					STEED
			I must say, you look more your
			old self --

					EMMA
			You mean my other self ...

					STEED
			Either way ... may I ask: why
			you dress in that fashion?

					EMMA
			I should have thought that was
			obvious ...
				(off his smirk)
			I'm in mourning.

	She moves off.  Stay on his poker face.

					STEED
			I can't wait to see afternoon.

	He joins her; they survey the building.

					EMMA
			Where's the picnic?

	They look up to --


87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

	A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling --

	Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous
	and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and
	ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ...

	On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes. 
	And wrapped presents before each.

	Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. pinned to
	their fur.  A children's tune, "THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC," plays.  Followed by -
	a gavel rapping order.

	A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which ECHOES through our
	story --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...

	The teddy bears look round.  Can't hear who's talking.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Today is history. The first day of the future. 
			I welcome you to the first general meeting 
			of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied 
			with our colleagues from Brolly ...

	Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			You have all given time, money and expertise 
			to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a 
			new phase of our operation. From today, 
			many of you will no longer be needed. I have 
			to warn you ...

	Dismay from the teddy bears.  As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT,

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ... 
			A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is 
			no longer secret. Agents are investigating 
			us. Their names are John Steed and Emma 
			Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us 
			... perhaps more than one ...

	Uproar from the teddy bears.  Shouts of "Who?" (*PS: One of the Teddys is a giant
	rabbit who seems especially alarmed).

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			That remains to be seen. When we find 
			the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.

					TEDDY BEAR #l
			These agents.  Where are they?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Here. In this building. By our estimate, they 
			will enter this room in thirty-five point five 
			seconds precisely ...

	Panic.  The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I am sorry the party is over.  But we 
			shall meet again.
			To each of you a gift. A token of
			my appreciation.

	In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink
	and silver bow.

	The tartan teddy opens his up:  A snow scene.  Anxious moans.


88      INT.  BUILDING - NIGHT

	UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to the
	conference room.  The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.  To FIND an empty room.
	Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the
	teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING again OVER ...

	One snow shaker left.  Steed picks it up:  Inside it:


89      TINY EMMA PEEL

	in black leather.

					STEED (O.S.)
			For you, Mrs. Peel.


90      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma stares at it.  Turns it over:  an address.

					EMMA
			Another invitation. 38 Marlborough
			Terrace ...


91      INT.  EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT

	Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.  A dilapidated hammer and sickle
	tapestry in tatters.  Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms.

	Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside.

	They search for clues.  A cigar left in an ashtray.  Steed picks it up with distaste. 
Then   moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne --

					STEED
				(admiringly)
			Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ...
				(then puzzled)
			But he bites the end of his
			Monte Cristos ... ?
				(frowning)
			Clearly, we're dealing with a
			maniac.

	Meanwhile, Emma goes into the --


92      NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV

	where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.  A few
	pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit.


93      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk.

					STEED
			Colonel Crabtree. International
			Satellite Systems. Formerly of
			the Ministry.

					EMMA
			How on earth can you tell?

	Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name.

					STEED
			Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw
			isn't the only shoemaker still
			practicing his trade ...

					EMMA
			Very good, Steed ...

	A MEWLING SOUND.

					EMMA
			What's that?

	Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into


94      ANOTHER ROOM

	Dark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps.


95      STEED

	looks up as Emma emerges with - 

	A Leopard cub.  Steed raises his brolly.

					STEED
			What on earth?

					EMMA
			Any ideas?

					STEED
			Well, he was a fellow of the Royal
			Zoological Society ...

					EMMA
			Is that written in his shoe?

					STEED
				(smug)
			Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(shrugs)
			She had this in her mouth. There,
			there...

	Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.  Inside -- another
	address:  84 Cadogan Place.

					STEED
			Not again.  There's got to be
			another. way to go about this.


96      EXT.  CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) -
	NIGHT

	Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.  Before gliding through
	an open French window --


97      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	Emma investigates.  Nobody there.  She looks 'round.  Military memorabilia.  Busts of
	Napoleon and Charlemagne.  Looks inside drawers.  Desks.  Meanwhile --


98      INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... licking, pawing him ...

					STEED
			Now, now ...
				(sings)
			'I can't give you anything but
			love, baby...'


99      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT	

	Emma searching ...


100     OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR	100

		a key in lock.  Door opens.  Silence.


101     INSIDE - EMMA

	finds a snowshaker.  About to look underneath.  Hears a NOISE.  Looks up, in front of
	her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.  Ready to strike --

	Emma swivels 'round,  a fluid balletic motion, and --

	Bam!  A kick to the teddy's stomach.  Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her
	shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as --

	The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.  She falls.  Teddy grabs a military
	sabre from the wall, and Woosh!  Slices through air at Emma's head.  She ducks.  The
	sabre skims her hair.  Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on!

	Emma counterattacks.  Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off! 
	Jesus.  The torso stands unsteadily.

	Emma's eyes widen as:

	A man's head emerges from the teddy torso.

	Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ...

	Emma's out.

102     INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.  A little milk dribbles down Steed's chin ...


103     INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	The man goes to the other room.  Starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume. 
	Throws clothes into a suitcase.

	The PHONE.  Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Naughty teddy ...

					MAN
			No! You can't ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings, it rings for thee ...

					MAN
			But I've got rid of her.  She's ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Go to the window ... To the window.

	Teddy moves to the open window.  Sudden PAIN.  LIGHTNING.

	Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.  Direct hit.  The
	teddy slumps to the ground.  Soggy, waterlogged, very dead.  Kinda like the
	other guy ...


104     IN OTHER ROOM

	Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, sees dead
	Teddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ...

					EMMA
			Major D'Arcy ... ?


105     OVER HER SHOULDER

	from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" --

	-- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.  She makes a NOISE.  Emma
	turns just in time to see.

					EMMA
			Well, well. If it isn't me ...

	Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window ...
	she wears the same black catsuit.

	The real Emma rushes, follows her "double"

	Clambers outside to rappel up the line to


106     EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

	Emma looks.  Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings,
	flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ...

	Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.  Then turns a corner to see --

	Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant
	neon signs ...

	Several floors below, Emma sees the streets.  A twinge of vertigo.  Then she looks up,
	hears a NOISE -- From:


107     BEHIND GARGOYLE

	she sees her "double" run.  Emma gives chase.

	Hot pursuit.  Over rooftops.  'Round wires.  PAST neon signs high over the city ...

	Emma follows.  Gains on the "double," who --

	Pushes faster.  Gliding between rooftop buildings.  Dodging, weaving.  But Emma
	gains more.  Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until --


108     EMMA'S POV

	as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm.  And stumble on the other side for
	a footing.


109     BACK TO SCENE

	as Emma's adrenaline surges.  She cannot stop, she --

	Jumps!  Hangs in the air.  Limbs pushing out for the edge.  And only just, she lands
	perfectly, gaining, closing, until --


110     ON NEXT ROOFTOP

	Emma gains up close.  A final burst of acceleration.  Then without warning, her
	"double" --

	Turns, Emma catches up, and --

	Wham!  Wham!  A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts
	swiftly, surges into overdrive --

	In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- a
	flurry of kicks as Emma --

	Lands on her back.  The "double" attacks.  Emma retaliates --

	Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a
	METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing

	And vanishes into the rooftop maze.


111     AGAINST SKYLINE

	Emma stands.  Looks.   She's lost her "double."  She stands alone, silhouetted against
	the night sky.

	Caught in the moonlight.  Above sparks of neon.  Daunting, muscular, poised for
	action, as --

	Ears listening to distant noises.  SWOOSHING TRAFFIC.  FLUTTER of BIRD
	WING.  HUM of WIND through wires.  Then an AUDIBLE SNAP --

112     EMMA'S POV - HIGH ANGLE

	above her a SPAM as a STEEL CABLE WIRE of an aerial is snapped.  Slowly wound 
	tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring --

113     BACK TO SCENE - EMMA

	looks 'round.  Sees nothing, hears the sound of the WHIPLASH coming seconds 
	before --

	Through the air --


114     EMMA'S POV

	a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly enough as --


115     BACK TO SCENE

	as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from
	her, as the wire --

	Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her
	over the city.  She looks down.

	A long way.

	Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back.  She drops down to the rooftop ...

	Slithers down the roof.  Slips --


116     OVER LEDGE

	Emma hangs on with fingertips.

	Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her:


117     ADVERTISEMENT

	for "Wonderland Weather" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high bikini-clad
	"Emma" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: "COMING SOON -- THE
	NATURAL BEAUTY OF WONDERLAND WEATHER."


118     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at "herself."  The surreal repetition of the loop. 
	Overlooking the whole city.

	Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out.  Just when from --


119     ABOVE HER

	an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down --

	Another CABLE for her to hold.  It uncoils down past the windows, telltale SPARKS
	flare up as it hits metal --

	Emma tries to grab for it.  Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a LIVE CABLE -- a
	thousand VOLTS surge through her body --

	-- A shock, Emma plummets DOWN TO --


120     STRIPED AWNING

	on a lower ledge.  She hangs precariously.  Catching her breath.  About to redouble her
	efforts.  When beside her from a --


121     BALCONY WINDOW

	an umbrella extended.  Steed reaches out, reels Emma in.  They are back in Teddy's 
	flat ... Emma collapses in Steed's arms.  He helps her up -- hands her a phone.

					STEED
			For you, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Thanks ...
				(dry)
			I see what you mean about letting
			me do the risking ... Hello?

	It's Sir August.

					SIR AUGUST (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly.
			Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell
			you everything ... The weather's
			getting worse and worse ... they're
			after me ... coming for me ... come
			quickly!

	CLICK.

					EMMA
			Sir August...?
				(to Steed)
			What now?

					STEED
			Ask Mother.

	Sound OVER:  RING-RING.

122     INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY

	Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG BARKS.
	Finally, Sir August answers.

					SIR AUGUST
			Mrs. Peel -- ?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings ...

					SIR AUGUST
			No, please! I beg you ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Walk over to the window ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Let it be rain, please let it be --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Stay by the window. By the window.

	Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late.


123     OUTSIDE

	a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  Then a
	LIGHTNING STRIKE. And --

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes
	in ...

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Emergency alert ...


124     EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY

	PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down
	deserted streets.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
			Completely unpredicted ...


125     INSIDE CAR

					EMMA
			Where's Mother?

					FATHER
			Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't 
			take chances. I'm looking after 
			things while he's hiding out ...

	Father drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease.

					FATHER
			You're probably wondering how I 
			can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new 
			prototype from the boys in X division.  
			Micro-sensors in the system read 
			signals and road information. Converts 
			the info into miles per hour. 
			Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.

	Father jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. 
	Steed holds onto his hat.

					STEED
			We know one thing. That suspect
			was not Mrs. Peel.

					FATHER
			So you say ... 

					EMMA
			You don't believe him?

					FATHER
			It's Mother you have to convince.
			He's very agitated.  Wait here.

	Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue

	Steed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ...

					EMMA
			But

					STEED
			Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

	A red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the
	bodyguard, Brenda.

					BRENDA
			Fares, please,


126     INT.  BUS - DAY

	Steed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay Brenda, the
	conductor.  Go upstairs.


127     UPSTAIRS

	is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks on electronic
	panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper windows have been blacked out.

					MOTHER
			Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's 
			turning quite nasty. Sir August was 
			blown to smithereens. Along with 
			half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's 
			worried.

					EMMA
			He tried to warn us ...

					STEED
			We had a lead to Wonderland
			Weather but we got there too late.
			Someone tipped them off ...

					MOTHER
			Too late anyway. Today's escapade 
			was only for starters. This is no 
			ordinary weather. It's manmade. A 
			kind of weather bomb.

					STEED
			Impossible.

					EMMA
			Not quite. This is my field.

					STEED
			Is there anything that isn't?

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			The Prospero Project was started by 
			my husband. It was an early attempt 
			to solve the problems of global warming.  
			In theory, climate engineering is entirely 
			feasible. We thought of injecting a 
			chemical cocktail into the atmosphere 
			by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

					STEED
			Filling in mother nature's blind
			spots ... ?

					EMMA
			Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts 
			to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.  
			Propane gas mostly. In small quantities 
			it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone 
			layer. But it proved impractical. 
			Too bulky ...

					STEED
			But if someone miniaturized the
			process...

					EMMA
			That's what we were working on.

					STEED
			Sounds as if someone's hijacked
			your research.

					MOTHER
			Would it be possible to use it for
			military purposes?

					EMMA
			Directed by laser. Bounced by
			satellite. Quite possible.

					STEED
			Where would they aim for?

	Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again. 
	No one pays any attention.

					MOTHER
			London. The World Council of Ministers 
			meets soon on global defence. If you can 
			control the weather, you control the world.

					EMMA
			After the cold war ...

					STEED
			The hot and cold war ...

	Sign "Grand Opening Soon."  WIDEN to reveal ...


128     EXT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	Steed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...


129     INT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	A kind of space-age travel agency.  Steed enters.

	At the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.  Steed sneaks in, moves
	behind a screen, overhears --

	A man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist

					BAILEY
			New orders. The penultimate phase. 
			Now fully operational ...

	Steed moves away from them, pushes a set of double doors open, arrives inside --


130     INT.  WONDERLAND OFFICE - DISPLAY - DAY

	A long corridor surrounded by a presentation of --

	Virtual reality weather:  clouds, sunny vistas, lush meadows, desert.  And slogans: 
	"Be natural.  Act natural.  Think natural.  The natural beauty of Wonderland Weather."

	Steed reacts; the model is the same as Emma on the big neon sign near Harrods ...

	Steed finds a desk.  Inspects papers.  Sees a postcard of a large stately home.  He
	pockets it.  Then looks 'round to see --

	Bailey before him.  We recognize him as the young dandy trailing Steed.  Neither gives
	away the other.

					BAILEY
			We're not yet open for business,
			I'm afraid.

					STEED
			Shame. I was recommended. By a
			friend.

					BAILEY
			Really?

					STEED
			Sir August Merryweather? I was
			looking for something relaxing.
			Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

					BAILEY
			Normally, we'd be eager to
			oblige --

					STEED
			Seriously?  

					BAILEY
			Of course. Natural weather delivered
			to your door on demand. Down your
			phoneline. For limited periods.

					STEED
			You don't say. How real does it feel?

					BAILEY
			As real as you wish. Hot or cold.
			Humid or dry. Anything you like.
			Within reason.

					STEED
			There are limits?

					BAILEY
			The technology is brand new. Soon 
			it will be more powerful. We 
			anticipate a huge demand. Leave us 
			your number. We'll be in touch.

					STEED
			No need. I'll call again.

	Steed raises his bowler.  Bailey watches him go.


131     EXT.  WONDERLAND OFFICES - STREET - DAY

	Steed emerges, stares at his postcard -- the stately home and:  
	"Headquarters, Wonderland Weather, Ltd." as --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			My car. I'll drive.


132     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Emma's LOTUS ELAN WHIZZES BY...

					STEED (V.O.)
			A day in the country ...


133     INT.  LOTUS - DAY

					EMMA
			Three agents killed by bad weather...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret 
			defense establishment. A group of 
			eccentrics obsessed by weather ...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything 
			points to you.  No sisters?  No 
			undiscovered twin?

					EMMA
			Not that I know of.  Explanation?

					STEED
			According to Dr. Darling, you're a 
			psychopathic personality with 
			schizophrenic delusions, suffering from 
			recurring amnesia based on traumatic 
			repression, leading to outbursts of 
			anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

	Steed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt.

					EMMA
			Is that what you think?

					STEED
			Oh, well ...
				(beat)
			Just my type, Mrs. Peel.


134     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY

	The Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train at a level crossing,
	which just misses them --


135     INT. LOTUS - DAY

	Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks --

					STEED
			Do you always drive this fast?

					EMMA
			Have I trespassed on a male
			prerogative?
				(before his reply)
			We're being followed. I saw him
			at Trubshaw's ...

	Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, trying to catch up.
	Emma glances in the mirror, and --

					EMMA
			Hold on ...

	Puts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back to his
	seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind.


136     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY

	The Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  Emma tries to
	shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  Shaking 'round corners, as ...


137     BEND

	before Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind struggles
	to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner --

	And suddenly sees in front of her --


138     HUGE TRUCK

	crossing directly in their path!

					STEED
			Turn!


139     EMMA

	swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as --


140     TRUCK

	clears in time for the following car, which keeps going.


141     ON HAYSTACK

	as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ...

					OLD LADY
			Are you alright, young man?

					STEED
			I think so, thank you so much ...

	A SQUEAL of TIRES as -

	The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the
	Old Lady react ...

					BAILEY
				(relishing)
			Reach for the sky, pardner.

	Steed raises his hands.

					OLD LADY
			Oh, dear --

	To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and

	BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun
	spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed.

					OLD LADY
			Cocky little bastard. I hope he
			was a baddy.

					STEED
			I feel sure of it.

					OLD LADY
			I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be
			on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

					STEED
				(looks around)
			She was ...

	They start pulling away hay from the haystack ...

					OLD LADY
			You with Mother or Father?

					STEED
			Both, actually.

					OLD LADY
			Good. Glad to see they're together at last.  
			They don't get along. Promotion. Top job.  
			Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.

					STEED
				(not paying attention)
			You don't say.
				(mumbles)
			Like looking for a needle in a ...


142     INSIDE HAYSTACK

	Coughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He tries to conceal
	his relief at seeing her.

					STEED
			What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
			breathing?

					EMMA
			Barely.

					STEED
			You will let me know if you find
			that queen who's in need of
			protection, won't you?

	He pulls her out.  She's annoyed.

143     OUTSIDE HAYSTACK

	Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw.

					EMMA
				(holding it ruefully)
			This must be the last straw.

					STEED
				(takes one off
				her back)
			Here's the one that broke the
			camel's back.

					EMMA
			Someone didn't want us to get to
			the party.

					STEED
			I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

					OLD LADY
			I may be able to help you.


144     EXT.  STATELY HOME FROM POSTCARD - DAY

	comes to life.  Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey ...

					STEED
				(checks postcard)
			Wonderland Weather Ltd.

					OLD LADY
			This way ...


145     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - GROTTO AND MAZE - DAY

	On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail.  A MECHANICAL CLICK, its eyes
	conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed
	inside the walled grounds.  They move stealthily forward, unaware ...

					OLD LADY
			Over here ...

	The Old Lady waves them on.  They enter a tunnel into


146     MAZE

	Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides.  They follow the
	path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and U-turns.  At first intrigued ...

	Then perplexed.  Emma leads the way, Steed following.  The Old Lady slips OUT OF
	VIEW.  Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel.  Emma rushes ahead.

					EMMA
			Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A
			trapezoid shape, dictated by twin
			diagonal paths and a single
			curving path. A late Seventeenth
			Century design, originally for
			King William of Orange, copied...
			Ah ...

	Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner.  He pursues her.  Glimpses her.  Then loses her.
	Another glimpse.  Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly --

	Thru the other side of the hedge.  In two places at once.

					STEED
			... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing
			double again.

	Out of sight, Emma rushes on.  Around her, the hedges grow taller.  She seems to
	grow smaller.  Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem.  As she pushes
	her way thru --


147     FROM ABOVE

	the maze as a formal patter-n. Three tiny figures dart round.

									
	DISSOLVE THRU TO:


148     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	A pattern on a screen.  The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines.  Steed,
	Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots.  Someone, somewhere is watching
	them.  Laughter, then a familiar voice --

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Now this is more like it ...


149     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	Steed searches for an exit.


150     ANOTHER PART OF MAZE

	Emma sees a statue of a Butler.  Which springs to life.  Summons Emma.  She follows
	down a path strewn with leaves.

	As Emma steps on the leaves, she --

	Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole.


151     INT.  RABBIT HOLE

	Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland ...

					EMMA
			Steed ... !

					STEED (V.O.)
			Mrs. Peel ... ?


152     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as --

	Steed studies the classical statue ...

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... ?

	Steed hears a noise, turns to see --

	Emma walking towards him.  She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm
	around his neck.  Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the
	mouth.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... !
				(more kiss)
			Mrs. Peel ...

	The kiss ends.  Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her lipstick.  His tongue
	traces his lips; smarts ...

					STEED
			Your lipstick ...

	Poison.  He goes dizzy.  Steed collapses to the ground.


153     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the house, a grand hall.  Deserted.  A cobweb hangs from ceiling.  A velvet
	curtain tattered and torn.
	Emma.

	A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour.  Ahead, the real Emma sees --

	A giant staircase.  There on the stairs -- a glass eye.
	She picks it up.  Puts it in a pocket.  Emma goes --


154     UPSTAIRS

	Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase.  One of herself in ornate aristocratic
	regalia.


155     LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS

	Rooms on either side.  Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors.


156     INSIDE ROOMS

	A mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets ... ventriloquists'
	dummies... and ...

	Butterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness ...

	Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...

	Snow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils. 
	Emma picks up one snow scene.

	She shakes it.


157     EXT.  HOUSE

	as if in response, a storm gathers.  Shadowy clouds roll in.


158     IN MAZE

	A drop of rain starts to fall.  Steed's eyes flicker open.

					STEED
				(re: rain)
			Not again.

	He rises, looks down, reacts --

	Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... Steed kneels, next to
	her in the rain

					OLD LADY
			It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware.
			Tell Father.

	She dies in his arms.

	Wind picks up, too.

	Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement --


159     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL   PLAYROOM - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning outside.  Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD
	TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems to grow darker.


160     FROM BEHIND

	Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:

					VOICE (V.O.)
			I wouldn't shake that too hard.
			The weather might turn nasty.

	From the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  His shape and
	face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker.

					EMMA
			Quite a collection.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			If nature gives a man a collector's mind, 
			it doesn't matter what he collects.  
			Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. 
			A true collector grows more obsessive 
			as the years pass.

	Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...

					EMMA
			Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
			We have met ...

	From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing:

	Peter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER.

					EMMA
			Peter ... ?

	Instinctively Emma moves towards him.  A long pause.

					EMMA
			I must be dreaming ...

	Emma pulls back.  Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. 
	BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...

					PETER
			Listen... Very much alive.

	Peter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. 
	Peter raises her hand to his lips.

					PETER
			Darling, it's me...

	Emma shudders, battles with herself.

					EMMA
			Peter ...

	Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.


161     CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES

	Inside her pupil --

									
		FLASH CUTS TO:


162     MEMORY FLASHES

	His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass
	obscuring his face.


163     BACK TO SCENE

					EMMA
			Impossible ... how?

	Peter smiles disarmingly.  As if the answer was obvious.

					PETER
			For you ... all for you ...

	Peter comes over, folds her in his arms.  Takes her head between his hands.  Emma
	leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until --

	Lips parted.  Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --

					PETER
			Don't be afraid, darling.

	She turns, runs to the door.  Like a trapped bird.  She tries the door -- locked.  Another
	door -- locked.  A window -- locked.

					PETER
			Don't run away. I forgive you, 
			Emma. I know you left me. But 
			I still love you. Do you still have 
			my ring? I need it.

	Peter grabs hold of Emma.  She pulls away.  Emma sees his face before her, pleading
	with her.  Seductive yet nightmarish.

	As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --

	The big window overlooking the gardens.  She runs, leaps, and in SLOW MOTION --

	Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, as she --


164     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - WINDOW - DAY

	somersaults through the window down to the ground.  Lands with a THUD on the wet
	ground.  Looks up to see --

	Steed above her, the STORM RAGING.

					EMMA
			Steed!

	She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset.

					STEED
			Oh, no. First time, shame on
			you. Third time, shame on me.

	He slugs her and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			Diagnosis confirmed.  Mrs. Peel is 
			suffering from delusions and 
			hallucinations. An extreme personality 
			disorder. She imagines her husband 
			Peter Peel has come back to her ...

	CLOSE ON Emma's face.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			A classic syndrome, to overcome her 
			subconscious guilt at her other crimes.  
			We've attached her to the dreamscape 
			machine. We'll soon see what her 
			unconscious looks like...

	Emma's eyes flicker...

	Steed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.  This time he's eating her grapes ...

	Emma looks around ... Everything blurs.  A STEADY PULSE DRONE.  Tugs at
	leather straps.  No use.  WIDEN to reveal Emma strapped to a special couch --

	Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out into a
	Dreamscape machine.  Drowsy, disoriented.

					EMMA
			Where am I?

					STEED
			The Winslow Home for Retired
			Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry
			I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please
			forgive me. I thought you were
			someone else ...

					EMMA
			Was I?

					STEED
				(no smile)
			I expect that's for you to know
			and me to find out ...

					EMMA
			It was Peter -- I saw him ...

	Drugged, Emma's eyes drop.  FOCUS CHANGES TO --


165     ABOVE HER

	A giant spiral HYPNODISC WHIRRS, creating trippy black and white zig zag op-art
	effects a la Bridget Riley.

	She blinks.

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


166     SAME SCENE - LATER

	Steed is gone.  Dr. Darling leans over her.  Emma stares at the hypnodisc.  Closes her
	eyes.


167     EXTREME CLOSEUP ON HER EYES

	Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out via wires to --


168     UP ON WALL

	A "Dreamscape" apparatus like a liquid TV screen flicks thru random images from
	Emma's unconscious.  Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card views -- childhood 
	snaps --


169     BESIDE "BED"

	Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring.  During the
	interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without
	arousing her suspicion.  Pulls gently on it.


170     UP IN GALLERY

	In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed.

					MOTHER
			This man -- did you see him?

					STEED
			No. Her husband, she says. Alice
			tried to warn us. A trap. Tell
			Mother beware. Tell Father
			That's all.


171     BY COUCH

	Dr. Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma.


172     FROM HER POV

	He looks and sounds sinister.  From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a clip of keys
	hanging from his pocket.


173     BACK TO SCENE

					DR. DARLING
			I want you to say the first thing
			that comes into your head when I
			say these words. Do you
			understand ... ?
				(as she nods)
			Blue ...

					EMMA
			... bottle ...

					DR. DARLING
			Red ...

					EMMA
			... head ...

	
					DR.  DARLING
			White ...


					EMMA
			Knight ...

					DR. DARLING
			Black...

					EMMA
			... death ...

					DR. DARLING
			Love...

					EMMA
			... death ...

	Steed watching, listening ...

					DR. DARLING
			Flower ...

					EMMA
			... power ...

	The exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; unlocks her
	straps.

					DR. DARLING
			Nature ...

					EMMA
			... preserve...

					DR. DARLING
			Secret ...

					EMMA
			... love...

					DR. DARLING
			Hope...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Fear ...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Peter ...

	As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy
	psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past.

					EMMA
			... Piper picked a peck of pickled 
			peppers how many pecks of pickled 
			peppers did Peter Peel -- ?


174     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	Quietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble.

					EMMA
			How long have I been here?

					DR. DARLING
			Three days.

	Emma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy.

					EMMA
			Do you get paid by the hour?

	Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The "Dreamscape"
	machine winds down.  Up in the gallery --

	BAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You are here under observation, 
			Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. 
			Darling's questions

	Pushes Dr. Darling aside.

					EMMA
			I resign.

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You
			can't resign.

					EMMA
			Watch me.

	Emma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of staring at the
	hypnodisc.

	Emma heads for the airlock door marked:

	"ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE"

					MOTHER
			Don't open that, Mrs. Peel!

	Fat chance ... she goes in ...


175     INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER

	Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  And float
	helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  Mother's wheelchair,
	Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "OFF"
	switch

					EMMA
				(echoing)
			What are you trying to do to me?

					MOTHER
				(flailing)
			We want to help...!

					EMMA
			I thought I was a widow. My
			husband ... the only man I ever
			loved ... is dead. For the rest
			of my life I have to live with
			that.

					MOTHER
			The death of Peter Peel was a
			great loss. To us all ...

					EMMA
			To you ... ?

	Mother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the "OFF" switch.
	They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair,
	Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother --

					STEED
			I think you owe Mrs. Peel an
			explanation ...

	Steed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations.

					MOTHER
			Peter Peel was a first class agent.
			A senior operative.
			'X' department Special operations.  
			He was engaged in top secret research.  
			Top priority.  Government approved.

					EMMA
			The Institute ... the funding ...

					MOTHER
			A cover ... for us.
				(beat)
			I'm sorry...

	A turning moment for Emma.  A life lived on a lie.

					EMMA
			So all that time. Our work, our research 
			was for you ... for this? And the 
			accident --

					DARLING
			It was no accident.

					EMMA
			The official investigation ...

					MOTHER
			... was written by me.
				(beat)
			It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.

	Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him.

					EMMA
			Who?

					MOTHER
			Quite frankly ... it could have
			been you.

	Silence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes

					STEED
			You're accusing Mrs. Peel of
			killing her own husband?

					MOTHER
			Her husband suspected someone very 
			close to the operation. On the day he 
			died, he was setting a test.
			To prove to himself -- to us that his 
			wife was beyond suspicion. He had to 
			be certain. He said he was going to 
			give Mrs. Peel something ...

	Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.

					MOTHER
			... I want you to remember. Did
			Peter give you anything on-that 
			day?


176     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	touches her ring.


177     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma looks up at Mother.  A barefaced lie.

					EMMA
			No.

	Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously.

					DR. DARLING
			He said if it vanished, he'd know
			it was ... you who betrayed him.
			He took a huge risk. The ultimate
			test.

					EMMA
			So I'm still ...

					MOTHER
			Under suspicion. Everyone died in 
			the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were 
			the only survivor ...

	Mother waits.  Emma turns round.  Looks fiercely at him.  Mother shifts uneasily as
	Emma walks past him to the airlock.

					MOTHER
			This is an official matter, Mrs.
			Peel. No need to take it
			personally. Where are you going?

					EMMA
			To find out who killed my husband.

					MOTHER
			The doors and walls are monitored, 
			Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure 
			establishment.

					EMMA
			So am I.

	Emma pushes open the doors.  Walks out.  Down a corridor.  Dr. Darling grabs
	Mother, as he exits with Steed --

					DR. DARLING
			She must remain here. She's
			highly dangerous.


178     IN HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going ...

					MOTHER
			Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs.
			Peel. Unfortunately --

					STEED
			Guilty until proven innocent?

					MOTHER
			Mother and Father know best.

	Mother wheels himself off.  Then stops; over his shoulder:

					MOTHER
			Something quick. Nothing too ...
			messy.

	ON Steed.  CAR ROAR over as --


179     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE CLINIC - DAY

	Emma drives a hot-wired Morris Minor out the open gates of the manor house, past a
	sign which reads:

	"WINSLOW HOME FOR RETIRED LEPIDOPTORISTS" (Butterfly logo)

	In the b.g., a couple of old-timers race around with butterfly nets as Steed's jag pulls
	past them in hot pursuit.


180     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Emma speeds down lanes ...

	Followed at a safe distance by Steed in his SS100.


181     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Steed looks: a bleep on his radar screen tracks the --


182     CLOSEUP - CONCEALED MICRO-BUG - INTERCUT

	on Emma's shoulder as she drives ...


183     EXT.  LANES - DAY

	The cars whiz past ...


184     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Keeping an eye on his radar and the road, Steed switches on the radio.  The weather
	forecast:

					RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			'... Sunny intervals leading to
			sudden storms and gale warnings
			for all areas.
				(as he frowns)
			... Outbursts of rain, scattered
			hailstorms and freezing fog
			greeted the World Council of
			Ministers as they arrived in
			London for their conference ...'

	Emma drives into a churchyard.  Steed follows her ...


185     INT.  COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY	

	A medieval country church.  Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma
	as Steed watches her lay --

	A red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of
	eternal sleep:  Peter Peel.

	Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed watches Emma move
	away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.  Emma swivels round -- sees Steed.

					EMMA
			You followed me.

					STEED
			Orders.

					EMMA
			To kill me?

					STEED
				(fractional pause)
			Nothing personal.

	Emma smiles. Then turns, and --

	Runs!  Steed follows Emma through a door to --


186     INT.  CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY

	Steed enters, glimpses --

	Emma above.  He follows her.  Hears her footsteps.  Trip- trapping up the spiral
	staircase.  Steed listens, follows.


187     UP BELLTOWER

	From below, Steed hears a BELL RING.  A FLUTTER of BIRDS.  As debris falls
	down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches --


188     EXT.  BELLTOWER TOP - DAY

	BELL still RINGING.  At the top, a sheer drop.  Steed edges closer to the ledge. 
	Looks.  A long way down.
	From behind --

					EMMA
			A long way down.

	Steed swivels.  Sees Emma blocking his path.  Cool menace.  Steed steps away from
	the edge, Emma circles him.

					STEED
			Careful. You might fall.

	Emma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting on the ledge. 
	Rocking to and fro ...

					EMMA
			I could save you the trouble.

					STEED
			No trouble.

					EMMA
			Because you always obey orders ...

					STEED
			Always.
				(pause)
			Except ...

	Steed nears her.  Emma pushes herself right to the edge.

					EMMA
			Yes ... ?

					STEED
			... when I don't. It comes down to one 
			thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

	Steed reaches out for her.  Holds out his hand.

					EMMA
			And do you trust me?

					STEED
			I could be convinced, if ... I knew who 
			poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

					EMMA
			It wasn't me; you have my word.

	Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.

					STEED
			I need proof.

	Emma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She hesitates, then
	pecks him on the cheek.

					STEED
			It was longer. On the lips.

	Emma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  Steed grabs her
	hand, pulls her back.

					STEED
			Much longer.  Approximately ...
			fifteen seconds.

	Emma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him.

					EMMA
			... Ready?

	Steed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... Emma looks at her
	watch.  Counts seconds ...

					EMMA
			... Four ... seven ... ni-...

	Then ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.  Edging towards passionate.  They stay
	embracing for fifteen seconds ...

					EMMA
				(aroused)
			Mmm ... what are you doing?

					STEED
			Keeping a stiff upper lip?

					EMMA
			Is that all?

	The kiss continues couple of seconds longer.  Before Emma withdraws.  With an effort,
	she regains her composure.  A long silence.

					EMMA
			So I'm in the clear?

	Steed savors the kiss.  No reply.  His smile says it all.

					EMMA
			But you did suspect me.

					STEED
			Not for a moment.

					EMMA
			You're playing games.

					STEED
			Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			I thought you played by the rules.

					STEED
			I thought you didn't.

					EMMA
			I'm playing to win.

					STEED
			Winning isn't everything.

					EMMA
			Please don't tell me it's how you
			play the game.

					STEED
				(smiles; stands
				aside)
			After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

	Steed motions down the stairs.  It's close to the edge.

					EMMA
			No, after you.

					STEED
				(back to square
				one)
			You don't trust me?

					EMMA
			As far as you trust me.

	Emma motions.  Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round
	nervously.  Emma reads his thoughts.

					EMMA
			When it happens, Steed, you'll be
			the first to know ...

	With this comforting thought, Steed descends first.


189     EXT.  CHURCH TOWER - DAY

	As Steed and Emma exit from the tower, they see --

	A tranquil village scene.  Choirboys walk out from the church.  Nearby in the deserted
	village street.  A red PHONE BOX.  Which ...

	RING-RING ... Starts to RING.

					EMMA
			Who could that be?

	A ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed looks up: a clear sky.  He's puzzled.  Suddenly
	suspicious.  As Emma moves to the phone.

					STEED
			No -- don't answer it ...

	He pulls her back.  Emma looks at him.

					STEED
			That's it. The phones trigger
			the explosions --

	RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed connects the two as -- an
	angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...

	RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.  As the Choirboy nears the
	PHONE, Steed shouts --

					STEED
		Don't -- don't answer it -- !


190     CLOSEUP - PHONE

	RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the door --


191     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The door shuts.  Noise muffled.  The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted
	warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --


192     OUTSIDE

	Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.

					STEED
			Get down -- get down -- it's
			going to explode -- !

	Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as


193     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and

	Silence.

	No explosion.  A few seconds pass.  Steed and everyone
	are down on the ground.  As they see --


194     FROM PHONE BOX	

	-- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging.  He gets out, scans the crowd.  Then walks
	calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.

					CHOIRBOY
			It's your mother.

	The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --

	Steed dusts himself off.  Emma and everyone gets up.  Steed goes to the phone box,
	takes the call.

					STEED
			Mother? How did you find me?

	His expression changes as he listens.  Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off.
	He emerges from the box.

					STEED
			I told Mother I took care of you.

					EMMA
			You lied.

					STEED
			I equivocated. But you're not
			their big worry at present. It's
			Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...

	OFF Emma's reaction to this news --


195     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the upper room, in front of a mirror --

	With his back turned to us.  Dr. Darling holds something in his hand, and waits as --


196     DOWN LONG HALL

	Bad "Emma" walks over.  She stands in front of him.

	Blank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, we recognize
	on her neck a tattoo:  Z424.

					DR. DARLING
			We are in the final phase. I shall require 
			you to be especially obedient. There 
			must be no failures.


197     CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER

	which he grips tightly. As --


198     IN MIRROR

	a metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's
	slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ...

	Shakes the snowshaker ...


199     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	THUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal:

	Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts.


200     INT.  JAG - DAY

	Steed driving, winces with the drizzle.

					STEED
			Drat. Someone wants to implicate
			you in this affair, Mrs. Peel.
			Any idea who?

					EMMA
			No idea who. No idea why ...

					STEED
				(thinks)
			Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys
			All children's things ...

					EMMA
			... Or grown-ups, who still like
			to be children.

					STEED
			Quite. Any childhood friends?
			Enemies?

					EMMA
			Not to speak of. Peter and I
			were both loners. There was
			nobody.

	Steed thinks; sighs.

					STEED
			Very well. I have a friend who
			might be of assistance. He's at
			the Ministry. We'd better be
			careful.

					EMMA
			I'm a wanted woman, I know ...


201     INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY

	Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" --

	-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella
	and bowler.  Which is

	Emma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by.

					STEED
			His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

					EMMA
			Why's he called 'Invisible'?

					STEED
			You'll find out.

	At a door marked "Information -- Col. I. Jones." Steed knocks, opens the door for her.

					EMMA
			Aren't you coming?

					STEED
			I'll catch you up. Don't worry;
			he's expecting you.

	Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor.


202     INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY

	A room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets
	full of old paper.

	Dusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly Emma 
	hears --

	FOOTSTEPS.

	She follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER. 
	She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her --

	A filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own.

	Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams shut.  Still
	nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a --

	Desk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open up.  Then the
	phone lifts up by itself, a voice:

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
				(beat)
			Colonel Jones at your service,
			Mrs. Peel. Just a moment --

	Emma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As --

	A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.  The pipe
	lights; smoke belches forth.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel.
			That usually helps. Don't worry
			about me being invisible. Other
			than that I'm perfectly normal.

					EMMA
			I see.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Or rather, you don't. Learnt the
			tricks in camouflage. Till this
			accident made a prang of things.
			How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?


203     INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE

	Steed on the phone.

					STEED
			I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ...
			Barometer's falling fast. Mrs.
			Peel and I find ourselves in
			need of foul weather gear.
				(beat)
			Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff
			for starters. And then --


204     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE

	File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are. Steed asked me
			to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

					EMMA
			Peter's brother?  But --

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Half-brother to be precise.

	Emma is surprised.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... 
			research into robotics and plastics.  
			Overtaken by Peter's work on the 
			physics of climate change ...

					EMMA
			I know all this.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) 
			Do you also know that during your 
			final experiment, your halfbrother-
			in-law was under surveillance?

					EMMA
			Surveillance? By whom?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Father. She gave him an 'all clear' 
			after a security test by Dr. Darling.

					EMMA
			Who's now vanished.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Makes two of us.

					EMMA
			Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling 
			and Valentine were somehow in this 
			together? But that's absurd.

	Steed enters behind them on the run --

					STEED
			We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Hurry?  What for?  I'm just
			now --

					STEED
			You didn't tell her?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(testy)
			I was getting to it.

					EMMA
			Getting to what?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The World Council of Ministers meets 
			tomorrow to convene the new global 
			defense initiative --

					EMMA
			I fail to see --

					STEED
			There's a reception this evening. Colonel 
			Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

					EMMA
			Have we been invited?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(poker-voiced)
			Under the circumstances Mother didn't 
			see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

					EMMA
				(surveys her male
				outfit)
			Well, I can't possibly go like this.

					STEED
			I had a feeling. That's why we're 
			in a hurry ...

	Steed proffers an arm to Emma.

					STEED
			May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?

	She decides, takes his arm.

					EMMA
			You may, Mr. Steed.

	The A-team is born.  Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones.


205     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Troops rushing in to take up defense positions.  Searchlights pierce the cloudy sky.  A
	protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall.


206     INT.  MOTHER'S 22 BUS (AKA INSIDE MOBILE HQ) - NIGHT

	At the controls, Brenda looks on.  She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother.  Who
	picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in
	passenger seats --

	ORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --

					MOTHER
			Inside that hall are some of the
			Most powerful figures in the
			world. Tight security. Our
			only option.

					FATHER
			I'll see to it personally.

	Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --


207     EXT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Wind picking up.  Outside the grand palace hall for the reception of the World Council
	of Ministers, guards stand on duty.  Barriers, flashing lights.  Nobody gets past, 
	except --


208     INT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting. 
	He with bowler and umbrella.  She in black leather and boots.  They find themselves in
	a niche and freeze, very close to one another.  Steed sniff s ...

					STEED
			What's that you're wearing?

					EMMA
			It's called Black Leather.

					STEED
			Intoxicating. Here, have one of
			these.

	He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket

					EMMA
			What is it?

					STEED
			Limpet bomb. Small, very
			compact. From Trubshaw's.

					EMMA
				(hocks it on
				belt)
			When all this is over, we simply
			must get you out of that suit.

					STEED
			You first.

					EMMA
			Shall we?

	She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet carpets, glittering
	chandeliers.  From the hall, a SPEECH ECHOES:

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			... In the uncertain climate that threatens 
			this global initiative, no magic umbrella 
			can shield us.

	Steed checks out his own.

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			Only our own vigilance. Security and 
			stability are our watchwords.

	APPLAUSE.

	Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside...

					EMMA
			Trubshaw again? What now?

					STEED
			Snuff.
				(off Emma's lock)
			I must insist you try some.

	Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you high?  They
	walk on, open doors to --


209     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	An empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a --


210     MARBLE HALLWAY

	A black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.  Otherwise,
	empty.  A chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through
	empty halls.

					STEED
			They're playing your song, Mrs.
			Peel.

					EMMA
				(annoyed)
			'The Merry Widow?' I might have
			known. Where's the reception?

	They move cautiously forward as


211     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	Outside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white. 
	A Christmassy glow --

	Even troops play with snowflakes, until --


212     SEVERAL ANGLES

	The wind rises.  The snow falls harder.


213     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They head down a 
	corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As --

	Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. 
	Steed steals --

	A chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.  Steed
	looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him.

					STEED
			Oh, hello ...

					FATHER
			We want Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Dead, I'm afraid.

	Emma in hiding, listens as --

					FATHER (O.S.)
			You disobeyed an order, Steed.  
			Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot 
			be trusted.

	Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --

					STEED (O.S.)
			I think she can.
				(beat)
			Can you?

	Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice.

	Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone.

					FATHER
			I shall summon security.

	She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.

	Emma returns as the ALARM is raised --

					STEED
			Bad news. Father's looking for you.  
			Where are those bloody ministers?

					EMMA
			Have a look at this.

	She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow.
	Steed reacts, eyes wide.

					STEED
			It's almost May, for heaven sake.


214     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	The blizzard rages through streets --

	Now impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow start to climb up
	shop fronts.  And amid the sky --

	Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting
	troops --


215     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls --

	To Emma. But up ahead, sees --


216     STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS

	A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as --


217     INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT

	Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls,
	ceiling murals --

	The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese
	Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by --

	Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a web of
	diplomatic protocol, interrupted by --


218     CENTER OF HALL

	The sight of Emma Peel in black leather.

	She strides into the room.  Picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler.  All stare,
	Emma raises her glass --

					EMMA
			Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach 
			of protocol. An emergency --

	From the hallway -- BOOM -- !  The door bursts open, Emma is blown over by the
	blast as the purple cloud races inside.


219     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall.

	From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff --

					STEED
			Quick --it'll protect you --

	Emma inhales.  Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear -- CRASH -- !  They
	see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, wearing a gas mask,
	leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- heads like black flies -- in formation
	round the ministers, helpless on the floor.  A kidnapping --

	The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --

	Escape from the rear doors.  The butlers form a guard to protect the man.

	Steed and Emma run after them.  More butlers pursue.


220     EXT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	As troops roll helplessly in the snow-covered purple haze, the butlers load the ministers
	onto waiting choppers as --


221     INT.  MOTHER'S HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION	

	Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...


222     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as --

	Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls.  A butler passes them without noticing.  They try
	to emerge.  But another patrols --

	Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground.  He rises
	but Emma kicks him into as --

	Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse
	of butlers.  He shouts --

					STEED
			After him, Mrs. Peel!

	A whole posse of butlers then advances.  Steed faces them.

					STEED
			Go -- !

	Emma hesitates.  Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator.  She bangs the
	button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from MACHINE-GUNNING gas
	masked butlers strike the brass door as --

	Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers.  To give Emma
	time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to --

	Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as --


223     EXT.  ELEVATOR (UPPER FLOORS) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The posse of butlers fan out on to keep pace with Emma.  They head upstairs, pressing
	elevator "CALL" buttons on every floor, as --


224     INSIDE ELEVATOR	

	Emma waits inside.  Until she reaches --


225     EXT.  ELEVATOR (2ND FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Doors open.  A HAIL of BULLETS hit the lift as Emma hides to one side until the
	doors close.


226     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Emma sighs with relief.  COOL HUM as the ELEVATOR rises.


227     ON STAIRS - MEANWHILE

	Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as --

228     INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	At the next floor, the doors open --

	Two butlers rush inside.  BLAM -- !  Emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow
	punch,  then --

	Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to
	grab Emma by the throat.

	She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson hold on his
	arms and throat --

	And a knee in his back in time for --

	PING!  The BELL RINGS at --

	3rd floor where --

	Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face --

	Whooomph!  a blast of fire from --

	A flamethrower launched in the hall.

	Aaargh -- !  The butler gets fried, but --


229     EXT.  ELEVATOR (3RD FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Shields Emma from the worst of the blast. She  hurls him clear of the doors, which --


230     INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION

	Slam shut.  COOL HUM ...


231     EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to
	get upstairs to help Emma...


232     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Up Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap doors.  No
	secret panels.  The "floor" light flickers between floors.

	Waiting, until ...


233     EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma
	dives to the other side, then --

	Scrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  Scrambles more.  It
	slips out ...

	Just beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a foot, kicks the
	grenade towards the butlers, and --

	As her elevator doors close --

	BOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom --

	Rushes to --


234     ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Where he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The light PINGS.
	Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when --


235     BUTLER'S POV

	No Emma.


236     BACK TO SCENE

	The butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what to do, and --

	The doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in --


237     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	-- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we --

	PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator
	roof, limbs flexed against the walls is --

	Emma, who -- drops down and --

	Scissors the butler's head between her legs.

	The grenade rolls free ...

	Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and --

	Sits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from the guy, until --

	Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags --


238     EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	His head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps out, heads up for
	the stairs, the elevators doors.

	SLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which


239     INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Breaks from its ropes, and --

	Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes --


240     INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by
	step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles...


241     INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT

	Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which --

	Flips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the
	skylight.  As the grenade --


242     INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE

	BOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  Emma rushes
	thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked.

	A moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips
	the skylight up, and --

	Emerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her.


243     EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT

	Blades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined
	whirly chopper ...

	Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city.  Stands up
	before her --

	Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees assassin in balls.
	Flicks him backwards ...

	As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward.  
	But too late:  sees --

	The chopper -- about to take off.


244     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	The gas-masked MAN in the white lab coat:

					MAN
			Goodbye, Mrs. Peel!


245     EXT.  ROOFTOP

	The chopper rises slowly.

	Emma looks.  A fifteen foot leap ... Impossible.


246     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	A farewell wave from the gas-masked man.


247     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	contemplating the jump, beneath falling snowflakes, as the distance grows.


248     EMMA'S POV

	The rope/chain ladder coils into the chopper's belly.


249     INT.  CHOPPER - NIGHT

	Above London rooftops, after dark --

	The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, CO-PILOT and a Butler (ditto).  From the
	chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command module.  A fairy tale, snow white
	city.

	OVER the RADIO, interference.  A changing of stations.  Then a CRACKLY
	broadcast of "The Merry Widow."

	As the WALTZ serenades them high above the city  -- 
	a KNOCKING from outside on the door --

	Surprised reactions.  The Butler opens the door, sees --

	Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts.  The Butler is too dumbstruck to say
	anything.

					EMMA
				(shouts, re:  the
				gas mask)
			Anyone ever tell you you look
			like a housefly?

	Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out --

	The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air.  Emma watches him fall ...

					EMMA
			Anyone else need a lift?

	The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, still
	clinging ...

					MAN
				(to Pilot; intercom)
			Can't you throw her off?

	The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as --

	Blam -- !  a kinky leather boot crashes --

	Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the GLASS from the front of the chopper,
	SMASHES so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air --

	The INSTRUMENT PANELS WHIRR round as the Pilots struggle for control --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(intercom)
			Where'd she go?


250     EXT.  CHOPPER TOP - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	with the blades whirling directly over her head, Emma crawls over the top of the
	chopper and lets herself down the other side as London's lights twinkle beneath ...

	As the Co-Pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit --

	Emma grabs him with one hand, hoists him up into the air --

	The Co-Pilot dangles over the city.  Grabs Emma.  Slithers back onto the cockpit.
	Pistol whips her.  Emma crunches back onto the metal.  Blades whirring close!  
	The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask --

					CO-PILOT
			Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.

	He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where his head get
	sliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away separately ...

	As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated Man pulls her
	down the side of the chopper --

	Emma falls, but manages a flying handhold, hangs onto the chain wire below the
	chopper.  As --


251     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT

	The Pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings.  Trying to dislodge
	Emma ...


252     THEIR POV

	Thru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up topped in
	snow, feet up ... shinnying up the chain wire ...

	"THE MERRY WIDOW WALTZ," no longer heard as old record or ensemble
	arrangement but enormous, for FULL ORCHESTRA ...


253     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	grimly hoists herself up along the struts again, hand over hand, coming up to the
	cockpit from behind --


254     BACK TO SCENE

	With a sudden movement, she yanks the Pilot out from behind and he goes flying
	towards eternity on his own.

	The chopper out of control as the white-coated Man is left to fly it himself ...


255     IN NIGHT AIR

	"THE MERRY WIDOW" BOOMS, the chopper lurches, spinning round -- up and
	down, over spiraling corkscrews, an insane waltz ...


256     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The white-coated Man gets control ...


257     EXT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows.


258     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ...


259     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ...

	Up ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going on ... rockets and
	lights in the sky thru snowflakes ...

	Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and --


260     CLOSEUP SHOT

	Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit.


261     HER POV

	The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge!


262     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The Man sees the bomb ...

	Also flings himself onto the bridge as --

	Against b.g. of the fireworks display --


263     WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.  Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in
	appreciation ... great fireworks!


264     EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him.

	He runs too -- towards --


265     ANOTHER CHOPPER

	which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... 
	The Man reaches for the dangling ladder --
	but --


266     CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT

	stuck, wedged between narrow battlements.


267     BACK TO SCENE

	The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.  He
	pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper,
	leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over,
	when she sees --


268     CLOSEUP - SHOE

	Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street."

					STEED (V.O.)
			I thought it was Cinderella
			who lost her slipper ...


269     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN

	On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  PA
	announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a
	CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. 
	Steed & Trubshaw beside her.

					EMMA
			This time the shoe's on the other
			foot. You said a hand-made shoe
			was as good as a photo-fit or
			D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is
			find the shoe that fits ...

					TRUBSHAW
			It should be easy. A Trubshaw
			client has his shoes delivered
			personally. The Ministry should
			be able to confirm our delivery.

					STEED
			I'll be back ...

					EMMA
			Where are you going?

					STEED
			Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather 
			may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

					EMMA
			You needn't bother. I can't drag you 
			further into this. After all, I am still 
			the chief suspect.

					STEED
			No bother. Mother and Father think
			I've joined you. I might as well.

					EMMA
			But --

					STEED
				(comes back)
			Oh, and by the way, I think it's about 
			time you got rid of that chip on your 
			shoulder.

					EMMA
			If you'd been through what I have,
			you wouldn't --

	Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder.

					STEED
			A microtag. One of Mother's little
			toys. There you are. Free at last.

	He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.


270     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	An armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords --
	ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ...

	Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ...


271     UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER

	Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe
	lasts.

					EMMA
			Prince Charming, I presume.
			Your name is ...


272     CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL

	with the name:  DARLING.

					EMMA
			Oh my God ...


273     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed selects his umbrella and we FOLLOW UP TO:


274     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - UPSTAIRS - DAY

	He sees only Trubshaw.

					STEED
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					TRUBSHAW
			She just left, sir. In a hurry.

					STEED
			What?

					TRUBSHAW
			She said you'd understand.


275     ON STEED

	Worried.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are ...


276     CLOSEUP - PIP PUFFING IN MID-AIR

	WIDEN to reveal:


277     INT.  MINISTRY ARCHIVES - DAY

	Inside the archives, among leather volumes.  A file goes through the air, passed to
	Emma ... As she reads.  A map is opened across a desk from her.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			'X' marks the spot. The shoes were 
			delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
			Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the 
			site of a former Ministry installation...

					EMMA
			... and now?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Privately owned by ...

					EMMA
			Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Very good, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			I shall need a small plane.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			You're not venturing alone, surely.

					EMMA
			I'm going to find out who killed
			my husband. Will you take these
			documents to Steed?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Of course.


278     ON EMMA

					EMMA
			Tell him I said ... goodbye.


279     INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ - DAY

	below the Thames as at the beginning.

	In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth.  Controls around him
	flash emergency.  Panic.  Cakes piled up beside him, uneaten.  Beside him, Father.
	Brenda hands a phone.


					BRENDA
			Steed for you.

	Mother grabs the phone, furious.

					MOTHER
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

	He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits
there.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I was hoping you could tell me.

					MOTHER
			You're getting yourself into terrible 
			trouble, my son. Weather's turning 
			very nasty -- and so am I.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I'm going to follow up on a hunch of 
			my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is 
			innocent and you have a mole.

					MOTHER
				(grabs mirror;
				searches his face)
			Where?

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			In your operation.

					MOTHER
			I'm warning you for the last time, 
			Steed: whoever's behind all this, 
			looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like 
			Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.


280     CLOSE ON MOTHER

	Furious.

					MOTHER
			Steed??
				(to Father)
			Find Mrs. Peel.

	Brenda smiles at the thought.  Father rises, grim.


281     EXT.  SKY - DAY

	Through mist, an ultralight plane zooms down -- From the plane, Emma leaps in
	parachute ...  Down, down, down through the mist ...

	Over parkland, the parachute floats down ... To an island in the middle of the
	Serpentine river.


282     EXT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - DAY

	Emma lands, buries her parachute.  Walks towards a thick jungle, then a stream.  Emma
	hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again.  Where a peacock fans its tail of
	a thousand eyes.  A CLICK of CAMERAS.

	In the midst of the jungle, Emma sees --


283     HER POV

	A red phone box.  Emma frowns in recognition; goes inside.  Picks up the phone.
	Presses "Button B", and --

	The floor goes down.  Emma goes down with it, into --


284     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND HQ

	Formerly a Ministry installation.  The "elevator" stops.  Remembering, as from a dream,
	Emma steps out into --


285     LONG DARK CORRIDOR

	A GUARD patrols.  Emma pushes herself against a wall.  The wall gives way to flip
	round, and Emma swivels into --


286     INT.  TOTALLY DARK CHAMBER

	The door locks behind.  Alone, Emma stands warily.

	From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice.  Intimate.  Seductive.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have 
			been a worthy opponent. You have 
			tracked us down. You are within an 
			ace of winning.

					EMMA
			This isn't a game.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Quite right, but we still make the rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			People, too.

					EMMA
			Then who wins?

					VOICE
			You and I. Together. But first you 
			must confront your greatest enemy.
			Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?  
			The answer is obvious ...

	Suddenly lights!

	Emma is in a hall of mirrors.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Yourself.

	In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her,
	splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and confused by the multiple images.

	Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the
	lips.

	Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls her mouth
	away, staggers back; realizes too late.  The hallucinogenic lip poison.  Emma crumples
	to her knees as --


287     EMMA'S POV

	Sees "herself" above her, before she -- falls unconscious.


288     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Steed's Jag races, skids in bad weather.


289     INT.  CAR

	Behind the wheel Steed, his face grim, concentrates on the slippery road.  On the seat
	next to him the snow shaker with little Emma inside --

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


290     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	As if in a dream, Emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage:  A life size snow shaker.
	Emma "swims" in viscous air,	suspended like a mermaid.  Thru glass she sees --

	A face peering in:  Father.

					FATHER
				(filtered)
			Emma in Wonderland. Welcome,
			Mrs. Peel.
				(filtered)
			We've been expecting you. We hope 
			you'll enjoy your stay with us. 
			Decontamination is almost complete.

					EMMA
			Decontamination -- ?

					FATHER
			And you've a new wardrobe. He
			does want you to look attractive.
				(beat )
			He tells me you're very beautiful.

	Emma pounds the glass in frustration.

					FATHER
			Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds
			of feet below ground. The Ministry
			made it impregnable. No one can
			save you.


291     EXT.  SPIRES OF ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	as Steed drives towards it ...


292     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - DINING ROOM

	Bathed in candlelight.  A romantic supper for two ...

	A door opens, admitting -- Emma. Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous.  She locks
	around, sees another door.  In search of escape she hastens to open it, only to reveal --

	A giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting.

	Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, removing the 
	head -- it's Dr. Darling!!!


					DR. DARLING
			Emma, my dear. How lovely you
			look.

	He steps out of the rest of his costume ...

					EMMA
			Would that I could say the Same.

					DR. DARLING
			Ah, but you haven't see the real
			me. Watch closely ...

	He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her --

	Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as --

	Dr. Darling turns into ... Peter!

					EMMA
			Peter ...

					PETER
			Darling Emma --

					EMMA
			It was you ... all the time?

					PETER
			Not really. Not quite. I'm
			afraid you still don't see ...

	Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting ...

	Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head.

	It's Valentine!

					TEACHER (V.O.)
			Valentine Peel ...


293     EXT.  ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	beneath Gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails.

					OLD TEACHER (V.O.)
			Yes, I remember him quite well ...

	PULL BACK THROUGH windows to reveal:  Steed and an OLD TEACHER in the
	beautiful library.

					OLD TEACHER
			This is where he used to spend his
			days. We have an old photograph
			somewhere ...

	He's flipping through yearbooks, then shows Steed --


294     CLOSEUP - PHOTO

	of Valentine Peel on stage, in wizard's garb.  Made up as an old man ...


295     BACK TO SCENE

					TEACHER
			Absolute wizard with makeup. His

			Prospero ...

					STEED
			'The Prospero Project...'

	grim.

					STEED
			'O Brave New World that hath

297     BACK TO DINNER TABLE

	Emma frozen, sinks into a chair, staring ...

					EMMA
			You.

					VALENTINE
			Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true 
			genius behind the Prospero Project ...

	He walks around the dinner table as he talks ...

					EMMA
			But you died -- in the explosion ...


298     FLASHBACK - CLOSE ON HAND IN WHITE GLOVE

	Twisting the dial.  PAN UP the arm to reveal Valentine.

					VALENTINE (V.O.)
			Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.


299     BACK TO PRESENT

					VALENTINE
			A slight miscalculation -- my face 
			was burned beyond recognition.
			Fortunately my research into plastics 
			came in handy ...

					EMMA
				(stunned)
			Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

					VALENTINE
			An unholy trinity ...

					EMMA
				(stands)
			You killed my husband.

					VALENTINE
			For starters. Of course I had to kill 
			the Teddy Bears, as well ...

					EMMA
			Too many cooks --

					VALENTINE
			Spoil the majority shareholders. In 
			Wonderland Weather. I planned 
			everything, even the Ministry 
			recruiting you ...

					EMMA
			But I found you. All the clues
			led me here ...

					VALENTINE
			Of course. I planned that, too.

					EMMA
			But -- why?

					VALENTINE
			You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't
			you guess?
				(moves toward her)
			For you. It was all for you ...

					EMMA
				(cold)
			'Our revels now are ended.'

					VALENTINE
			Oh, no, Emma. They've only
			just begun ...


300     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE - NIGHT

	The phone hangs in the air -- with the smoking pipe.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The shoes were delivered to an island

goodbye. What?


301     CLOSEUP - STEED IN RED PHONEBOX (SOMEWHERE) - NIGHT

					STEED
			I said it's not goodbye yet.
			Listen, I'm going to need some

302     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND - DINING ROOM

					VALENTINE
				(indicates supper)
			Think of this as your second
			wedding feast ...

					EMMA
			I'm already married ...

					VALENTINE
			Come, come, you're a widow -- a
			most attractive widow. Now I think 
			of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

	He pushes a button.  Bad Emma enters.  Tattooed Z424.  Unmistakably hostile.

					VALENTINE
			My latest model. A compound of 
			plastics and sensor chips. A big 
			improvement on the old X404s.
			The poor thing is quite fond of me. 
			Emma, say hello to Emma.

	BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK.

					VALENTINE 
			You know, I believe she's actually 
			jealous.

					EMMA
			Valentine, listen to me ...

					VALENTINE
			Right, bridesmaid. Now what
			have I left out? Oh, yes, I know:
			the ring.

					EMMA
				(covers her hand)
			Ring?

	He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then:

					VALENTINE
			How silly of me -- let me make
			you comfortable first ...

	As he advances, ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSEUP Emma's eye

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


303     INT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - NIGHT

	Another ball, WIDEN to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high plastic ball
	emerges -- The ball lands on the shore.  From the inside, a zip peels away the plastic
	layer to reveal --

	Steed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler.  A rose in his lapel.  He steps out, and,
	poking with his umbrella --

	Deflates the inflatable plastic submarine.  Steed heads off -- CAMERA EYES the
	peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where he sees the --


304     RED PHONEBOX

	Steed picks up the phone.  Presses all the buttons until he hits "Button B."  As the floor
	lowers, his eyes widen in surprise ...



305     SARCOPHAGUS

	carved in Emma's likeness.  Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into --


306     INT.  VALENTINE'S HIGH-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	as Valentine descends spiral steps to join it.

	Valentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within.

					VALENTINE
			That's better. I say, isn't this 
			where you came in? It's
			impenetrable, by the way ...

					EMMA
			You're mad.

					VALENTINE
			Entirely. On the other hand
				(he advances towards
				her, smiling)
			Mad people get things done. Let
			me show you --


307     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed stealing down a corridor and --

	hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras.  He waits till
	they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and --

	Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.  Brings her down.

					FATHER
			Steed

					STEED
			How did you guess?

					FATHER
			You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black
			Leather ...

					STEED
			It was you who gave Valentine
			Peel his security clearance ...
			you're the mole who betrayed
			the Ministry.


					FATHER
			Mother betrayed me. She was 
			going to replace me with a younger 
			Father.  Errand boy that's all I was.  
			'Find Steed...'

					STEED
			Well, you found me. Have a sniff of 
			this, why don't you? Careful, the 
			scent can be overpowering ...

	Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the
	rubber tube, sprays a Mist.  Father passes out.  Steed rises, locks around.
	Sees --

	A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return.  He turns 
	and --


308     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing --
	until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S.

	Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see --


309     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER

	Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as
	Valentine explains.

					VALENTINE
			People expect weather to be free. 
			They're used to it. I call that a 
			denial of freedom. No freedom of 
			choice. An abuse of human rights. 
			They buy water, electricity, gas. 
			Why shouldn't they be able to buy 
			their own weather if they want to? 
			If they have a little incentive ...

	Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.

					EMMA
			Such as?

					VALENTINE
			Destruction of their local weather 
			systems. I can zap a thousand 
			Chernobyls into the air.

					EMMA
			The result would be ...

					VALENTINE
			Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop 
			failure.  Economic disaster.  
			Frostbite or sunburn ... on a 
			massive scale. 
			You've seen a few samples...

					EMMA
			Then what's stopping you?

					VALENTINE
			One very small thing. A diamond
			'cyclone' chip. A thousand times
			more information on a fraction of
			the size. If I possess that, my
			powers would be unlimited. My
			dear half-brother was developing
			it. But he suspected sabotage.
			He gave the chip to ... you,
			'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But
			also your ring.

	Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --


310     CLOSEUP - HER RING

A diamond.  In the light, a patterned imprint.  ZOOM IN -- a complex fractal equation of circuits.


311     BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			The missing piece of the jigsaw.
			I tried to get you to give it to me 
			as Peter; I tried to steal it from 
			you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll 
			be a bit less subtle.
				(he slips it off her
				finger; holds it up)
			With this ring my plan will be
			complete.

					EMMA
			How Wagnerian ... Do you mean 
			to say you've waited all these 
			years because you couldn't create 
			a chip on your own? That would 
			have amused Peter.

					VALENTINE
			Speaking of Peter, there's more good 
			news: You won't even have to change 
			your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			What are my choices?

					VALENTINE
			Choices?

					EMMA
			I'll never marry you.

	Valentine is philosophical.  He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma 
	lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --

					VALENTINE
			One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you 
			alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, 
			you may change your mind. If you're 
			still in it.

	Valentine presses a button.  From the ceiling -- a surgical laser.  Moves down to within
	inches of her face.

					VALENTINE
			This little toy gave me back my face.
			It can replace yours. What do you think?
			Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
			Thatcher?

	He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face.

	An ALARM BELL RINGS.  Emma reacts.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Dr. Darling, this is Father. We
			have an intruder. I repeat --

	Valentine switches off the PA.

					VALENTINE
			Ah. That will be Steed. He followed 
			you. Please excuse me. I have work 
			to do. My most spectacular 
			performance. A ballet of clouds. It 
			was made for you. I want to give you 
			a heart, Emma. I want all of London 
			to see it. And now with this ...
				(flourishes ring)
			They will.
				(leans close)
			And for an encore: the biggest cyclone 
			in history will wipe the City from the 
			face of the earth.
				(winks)
			Shape of things to come, my darling.

	He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests. 
	Darkness.

	Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille.  No such luck.

					STEED
			Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!

	He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in
	that thing, anyway.

	He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.


312     EXT.  SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT

	Moonlight night.  Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows.


313     INSIDE CLOUDS

	MOISTURE SPITS and CRACKLES, static energy waiting to explode ...

	In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- over the city -- a
	strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half dreamlike.

	That stalks the city....


314     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed crawling.  A rat runs over him ...

					STEED
			The things I do for England ...

	Pitch dark, then --

	Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.

	Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo
	the gag.  Bad Emma removes it, she --

	Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh.
	Blood.  Her flesh.  Her blood.  Fascinated.

					EMMA
			You must let me go ...

	Bad Emma listens.  Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to --
	the HEARTBEAT.  Ba-boom.  Ba-boom ...

					EMMA
			Don't you understand? If he has
			me, he'll have no use for you ...
			he'll destroy you ...

	The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission.  She goes to the laser, aims
	it at Emma's face!

					EMMA
			No...

	Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --


315     ANOTHER PART OF UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him --

					STEED
			Oh, dear.

	No escape.  He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at
	the guards, and --

	Hurls it ...


316     CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)

	A glinting razor's edge, which --

	Swoosh -- !  Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed.
	He taps twice hard steel as ...


317     OTHER GUARDS

	run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a
	sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !  One drops -- Bam -- !  The other collapses, slump
	to the ground.  Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --

	A dent in its steel top.  For the first time, Steed loses his cool.  Genuine rage.

					STEED
			Someone's going to pay for this.

	Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --


318     CLOSEUP - VALENTINE

	places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ...

	WIDEN to reveal ...


319     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	Masses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... )

	Valentine hits a switch ...

					VALENTINE
			Start the countdown. Action
			stations. Five minutes ...

	The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards --

	Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts.
	A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.  The CLOCK TICKS.

	Father enters behind him.

					FATHER
			Congratulations. The clouds are
			on course ...

					VALENTINE
			To explode. London will be ashes.

					FATHER
			Not yet! They haven't heard our
			terms ... !

	Father tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off.

					VALENTINE
			Are you insane? Stop the program
			and you activate the auto-destruct!

					FATHER
			But all those people -- !

	Valentine strikes her hard --

					VALENTINE
			My cloud ballet! My cyclone!

	Father slides to the floor.  Valentine ignores her.  Concentrates on the control panel red
	lights, as --


320     EXT.  PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT

	Up in the sky, more white clouds --

	Darken into boiling black.  They move and billow.  Bubbling with gases and energy
	Swirling with motion, a life of their own.

	FROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.  It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as
	it rolls --


321     THROUGH CITY STREETS

	then RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.
	A love heart.


322     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL READOUTS

	Whirling backwards ...


323     INT.  MOTHER'S UNDERWATER HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother at the controls.  RINGS the ALARM.  Panic stations as -- SIRENS BLARE. 
	WARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --

					MOTHER
			Dense cloud formation moving south-
			west. On course for the center of the 
			city. A fog floating in from the river. 
			The prediction is ... unstable chemical 
			reaction. Enforce the curfew ... 
			Emergency stand by ... !


324     EXT.  SKY OVER BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

	Bad storm clouds advance over London ... black and furious.


325     OVER CITY - SEVERAL ANGLES

	As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter.  An airborne CYCLONE of BELCHING
	static ELECTRICITY.  The black shape now --

	Forming a sensuous female shape.  Like a dream wisp of ...

	Emma Peel with an hourglass figure.  While --


326     FROM RIVER

	The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -- trying to
	connect, to form the cyclone ...


327     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Action stations.  AIR RAID SIRENS ...

	Like a re-run Blitz.  Streets now eerily empty and dark.
	Through deserted streets --

	Troops race to positions in gas masks.  Searchlights illuminate clouds.  Worried faces
	watch the skies, as --


328     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL NUMBERS

	Fly ...


329     INT.  HI-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - DAY

	Chaos on all TV monitors as ...

	Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin.  What will he find??
	Emma's there, still gagged.  Looks asleep.

					VALENTINE
			My dear.
				(pulls the gag:
				kisses her)
			I wouldn't want you to miss the
			grand finale ...

	Emma opens her eyes.  Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale sign:  Z424. 
	Bad Emma is unmistakable.  He strikes her -- yanks her out of the coffin.

					VALENTINE
			Find her. Kill her ...

	He races back upstairs as ...


330     INT.  UNDERGROUND HYDE PARK - HQ CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling
	high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.  She hears NOISE IN the
	DISTANCE.  Suddenly --


331     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed battles more guards!  No time to lose.

	Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers,
	closing in on --


332     INT.  UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.  Pounding on door.

	He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how
	to stop the program.

	Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in
water.


333     FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH

	opens behind.  Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.  Steed
	whirls.

					VALENTINE
			John Steed.

					STEED
			Valentine Peel. I see you've gone 
			back to using your original face.

					VALENTINE
			The last one you'll ever see.

					STEED
			Perish the thought.

	Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall.

					VALENTINE
			Did they tell you at Eton that I
			was fencing champion, too?

	Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto.

					STEED
			They said you were a very naughty 
			boy.

	The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller!


334     SEVERAL ANGLES

					VALENTINE
			You're better than I expected.

					STEED
			I was at Harrow ...

					VALENTINE
			But did they teach you this?

	Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A diminished phallic
	symbol.  Steed, dumbfounded.

	Valentine advances towards Steed --

	Who points the umbrella at him.

					STEED
			Bang-bang ... you're dead.

					VALENTINE
			You wish.

	He moves to close in, when ...


335     CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT

	from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --


336     VALENTINE

	recoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  Steed blows
	smoke away from the muzzle.

					STEED
			One shot -- for emergencies.

					VALENTINE
				(clutches wound)
			That's not playing by the rules.

					STEED
				(echoes Emma!)
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VALENTINE
				(pulls his own gun)
			If you say so.

					STEED
			I do.

	He FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor.

					VALENTINE
			You said ... one shot.

					STEED
			Did I? My mistake.

	Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind
	the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --

					VALENTINE
			I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

	Steed turns.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel -- !

	Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.

					VALENTINE
			Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the 
			thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's. 
			We'll be off now, won't we, darling?
				(to Steed)
			We wouldn't want to miss the
			fireworks. Figure it out if you can, 
			Steed ...


337     DOWN HATCH

	Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.


338     ON STEED

	He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control
	module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...


339     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The biggest cyclone you've ever seen starts slowly whirling above the city, gathering
	momentum ...


340     NUMBERS

	going down, down, down, as ...


341     INT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine drags Emma backwards ...


342     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The cyclone picking up force ...


343     CLOSEUP - STEED'S HANDS

	pull up a chip.  The red numbers freeze.  WIDEN to reveal...


344     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SIRENS CEASE.  Steed allows himself a smile of relief.


345     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The giant cyclone begins to break apart ...


346     SEVERAL ANGLES - DYING STORM


347     CLOSEUP - RELIEVED FACES

	Troops pulling off gas masks as ...


348     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - ON SCREENS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ...

	Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM reconfigures.
	A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words: 

	"AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES"

	start flashing ...

	A different set of numbers start running backwards ...

					STEED
			You must be joking ...

349     EXT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS.

					VALENTINE
			Fool ...

	In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall
	down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead.

					STEED
			That will do.

	He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver.

					VALENTINE
			Aren't you forgetting about
			something?

					STEED
			You are, and it's behind you.

					VALENTINE
			Come, come. You don't really
			expect me to fall for --

	Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.

					VALENTINE
			Let go, you ... idiot ...

	Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine.

					STEED
			I think she really likes you ...
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					VALENTINE
			Ugh ...

	As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she
	chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

	One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine
	locked in her arms in a dying embrace.

	They fall into the mists and liquid below.

	Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ...


350     EMMA

	Dead.

					STEED
			Emma!

	He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body.

	Emma lying sprawled out on the ground.

	Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with
	tears.  He lays her down.

					STEED
			Emma ...

	He produces Peter's ring.


351     CLOSEUP - RING

	Slips it onto her finger and ...


352     BACK TO SCENE

	Kisses her.  A chaste kiss on the lips.  But with the force and passion of a lover.  He
	closes his eyes, looks away in grief.  The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't
	give a damn.

	Behind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  Looks up at
	him.

					EMMA
			Steed?

	Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			What kept you?

					STEED
			The plot.
				(realizing)
			Hello, we must be going ...


353     CLOSEUP - AUTO-DESTRUCT NUMBERS

	Racing backwards as ...


354     SEVERAL ANGLES

	Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's Labyrinth ...


355     MORE NUMBERS

	racing to zero, nothing to stop them ...


356     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus.

					EMMA
			Quick!

	Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ...


357     SEVERAL ANGLES

	3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is
	fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES
	OUT.


358     EXT.  ALBERT BRIDGE - NIGHT

		Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas.


359     BELOW

	it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing ...

	Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath.

					STEED
			'The owl and the pussycat went
			to sea -'

					EMMA
			'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

					STEED
			A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Still a bit chilly ...

					STEED
			English weather. You know, after 
			all we've been through, I should 
			say we deserve a long holiday ...

					EMMA
			Have you any place in mind?

					STEED
			As a matter of fact I have ...

	The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight.

									
	SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


360     EXT.  SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY				360

	A few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them,
	WHIP CRACKED by a --

	Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and
	snow into --


361     SAND

	The peasant stops, stares.


362     AHEAD OF HIM

	Sun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  POPS a
	CHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to


363     TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

	Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.

					EMMA
			I don't recall Siberia being this
			warm, Steed.

					STEED
			It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Our little paradise -- just made
			for two?

					STEED
				(looks; frowns)
			Not quite.

	On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption --
	with Brenda.  He waves to --

					STEED
			Our chaperon.

					EMMA
			Pity your mother came, too ...

	Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  Trubshaw
	pours glasses of champagne.

					STEED
			Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
			Is this the '28? A little more
			ice, I think ...

	Trubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother moves in.  Absorbed
	by Emma, now his new protegee.

					MOTHER
			About your next assignment, Mrs.
			Peel ...

					EMMA
			Next assignment?

	Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch -- an umbrella
	shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.

	PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather. 
	Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble,
	hearing --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops
			nearby?

					STEED (V.O.)
			Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll
			send Mother ...

	PULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.

					MOTHER (V.O.)
			Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps
			another macaroon ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Thank you, Steed.

					STEED (V.O.)
			Thank you, Mrs. Peel.

	Behind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.  CHINK of GLASSES.

									
			FADE OUT.

	Pulled up over flesh.  This is EMMA PEEL, scientist.  Sexual, invulnerable, cool.  Very

	the floor lowers automatically.  Emma disappears.  Hanging outside the box, a notice
	now reads "Out of Order."

	Next to the call box we notice a sign: an arrow pointing into the desert:  "London 84
	miles."


9	INT.  LABORATORY

	underground.  Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi
	tech.  Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von
	Braun goes disco.  Nears a door, marked:  "Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel
	Only." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud.


10      FROM AIRLOCK DOOR

	A man enters, older.  In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.  Early 40's, handsome,
	charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.  His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.

					PETER
			Ready, darling?

	Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.  She
	smiles.

					EMMA
			Ready as I'll ever be ...

	Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.  Peter takes her hand and they walk down:


11      LONG CORRIDOR

	air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth --

	A man joins them.  A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.  On his name
	tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.

	In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab

					VALENTINE
			Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready... 
			Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module 
			set ... Temperature control on course between 
			one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...

					PETER
			Anything else?

	Valentine smiles, shrugs --

					VALENTINE
			Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.

					EMMA
			Thanks, Valentine ...

	Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

	A shy look from Valentine at Emma.  Peter senses

					PETER
			Just a minute, darling. My brother's a 
			worry wart. I better have a word ...
			Valentine --

	Peter takes Valentine over to one side.  Emma checks gauges and dials.  Behind her a
	conversation.  Peter returns.

	He takes a ring from his finger --


12      CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM

	on a gold ring.


13      BACK TO SCENE

	He slips it onto her finger.

					PETER
			Something to remember me by.

	Peter smiles.  The remark strikes Emma as curious.  But no time to query.  She smiles
	back.  He gives her a kiss --

					PETER
				(checks his watch)
			See you in an hour ...

					EMMA
			One sunny day ...

	The countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.


14      IN DISTANCE

	Valentine watches her.


15      INT.  LAB CHAMBER

	Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive
	thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue

	The effect is very cold.  Frozen.  Numb.  Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty
	entombed and sealed in a glass coffin.  Plunged down into a vault.  Opposite her --

	In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.


16      FROM EMMA'S POV

	The sound of their HEARTBEATS.  Their BREATHING.  BLEEP and PULSE OF
	ELECTRONICS.  Thru glass and leather.  Like cerebral sex.  Technological, erotic.
	Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as --


17      UP IN CONTROL ROOM

	Valentine watches behind glass.  Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.  He attends to
	dials.  And to his female assistant --

					VALENTINE
				(thrilled)
			Readings still normal ...

	The assistant smiles oddly.  FOCUS ON --

	An insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404."  A replicant.
	They monitor screens.  A DULL HUM.


18      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	A weather antenna emerges from the ground:  an enigmatic phallic silver blob, like a
	Koons sculpture.  The sun glints off it ...


19      DOWN BELOW

	A temperature gauge rises.

	The ice is infused with pulsating colors: purple -- blue -- green -- red.  Starts to heat
up     as if --

	It soaks up temperature:  from cold to hot in instants.


20      CLOSEUP - WHITE GLOVED HAND ON DIAL

	"CUMULUS COLLECTOR." The graphs accelerate, but over the dull HUM -- a
	MURMUR, a BREATH.  As Emma's HEARTBEAT rises

	The gloved  hand turns up the dial, past a red danger mark.

	Suddenly a BLIP.  Something wrong.


21      DOWN IN HIS VAULT

	Peter Peel's "coffin" starts to overheat. Peter reacts --

					PETER
				(intercom cutting out)
			Losing control -- malfunction
			in thermal chamber -- for Christ's
			-- Emm --!


22      IN CONTROL ROOM

	Needles push off the dials, as --

	The ice swells: strange mix of colors, absorbing heat and energy in clusters of molten
	metal ... steam and sparks ignite ... Valentine's eyes widen in alarm ...

					COUNTDOWN (V.O.)
			Five -- four --  three -- two --
			one ... Three -- two -- one ...
				(repeating)
			Three -- two -- one ...


23      INSIDE COFFIN

	Peter's glass cracks

	The emergency light goes on -- the ALARM sounds -- lab assistants running ...


24      IN HER COFFIN

	Emma realizes; looks to Peter --


25      EXT.  SALTFLATS - DAY

	The "Koons" antenna is drawing a strange purple cloud towards it, from otherwise blue
	sky ... siphoning the purple atmosphere down itself into


26      INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic stations! Valentine looks
	aghast at the graphs:  all systems fucked, over the intercom --

					VALENTINE
			Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!

	FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as

					VALENTINE
			Emma ...


27      FROM HER VAULT

	Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod


28      ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)

	Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a
	nightmare --


29      BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma!


30      RAPID INTERCUTS

	The purple smoke enveloping Peter's	pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within,
	looking at Emma --

					EMMA
			Peter!

	Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.  Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She
	grabs, claws on glass --

	Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod
	cover, it --

	Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as
	behind her

					VALENTINE
			Don't wait for him -- he's not --

	Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove --
	twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as:


31      ABOVE GROUND

	The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!


32      CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING

	gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass --


33      BACK TO SCENE

					PETER
				(faint)
			Emma ... Emma ...

	As a GROWLING sound grows till

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision
	separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.  A trauma.


34      ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)	

	The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating
	backwards in --

	A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control,
	weightless, powerless, as --

	The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void
	opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --

	An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new
	version of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE --

	CREDITS SEQUENCE.


35      SERIES OF SHOTS

	In stark silhouette  The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space
	
	An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --

	A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.  Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts
	of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over --

	A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad 
	body --

	In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.  Flashes of: 
	hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut.

	A thorned stem, sharp to the touch --

	FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black
	and white of a chessboard as ...

	A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --

	A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed
	back - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ...

	A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie --
	umbrella stabs like a sword --

	Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and
	tossed into --

	His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
	Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --

	Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
	Then --

	PISTOL SHOTS OVER as:


36      INT.  EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

	A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots,
	naked beneath satin sheets.  Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus
	Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.  A toss of her hair.

	Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.

	Same every night.  Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel.
	From outside ANOTHER SHOT ...

	Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --


37      HER POV

	a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.  The
	damn thing BACKFIRES again ...


38      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma frowns, annoyed.


39      EXT.  STREETS - DAWN

	Zoom!  The sleek, sporty black Jaguar SS100 burns down deserted streets.  Inside is a
	bowler-hatted man --

	JOHN STEED, late 30's.  Handsome English gent, roguish looks, dandy's clothes.  A
	Beau Brummel figure in a Savile Row suit, velvet collar, embroidered waistcoat.
	A debonair Etonian, Steed oozes charm, wit and - when he chooses to -- hard-edged,
	steely menace.  He drives through --

40      LONDON (1999)

	This is 'Avengersland': a parallel world painted by Rene Magritte, forever England.
	Bright pinks, greens and reds, an imperial city in final decadent bloom.  White stucco
	buildings. Regency style in candy colors.  A surreally 90's city like a hipper, edgier
	version of the 60's preserved in aspic, where --

	Over the RADIO, a plummy voice:

					ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... The War Office today approved military 
			expenditure for the nation's new defense alert 
			system. A spokesman  said he would raise the 
			matter at the forthcoming World  Council of 
			Ministers, but that a state of vigilance was 
			still necessary in the uncertain climate.

	As Steed turns into a mews, we realize that in this kinky, pop world, ordinary life does
	not intrude.  No traffic.  No extras.  Nothing to spoil the view.

	As the radio continues with a weather forecast, Steed --


41      EXT.  STEED'S GARAGE - DAWN	

	Steed's car enters his garage -- Door closes as --


42      INT.  STEED'S FLAT - DAWN

	but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.

	A large bachelor's den.  Dark wood, leather armchairs ...

	Steed enters his library from a concealed door --
	Titles on wine and birdwatching.  He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet. Pours
	a brandy.  Hears a noise ...

	Instantly on guard.  In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.  Steed peers 'round a
	corner.  Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar?
	Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --

	Crack!  Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.  Who manages to dodge,
	swivel 'round, and --

	Bam!  Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.  A rapid exchange of blows.  Steed
	recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --

	His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam! a
	spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they
	freeze.

	Steed knows his opponent:  a lethal blonde in red leather.

					STEED
			Brenda -- ?


43      FROM ABOVE HIM

	a voice --

					MOTHER (O.S.)
			Steed -- ?!


44      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling
	inches before him --

	Pommaded hair, fat, dandyish:  MOTHER, head of secret services; hands of extendable
	metal hooks.  And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard.  Who smiles
	seductively.

					STEED
			Mother. I thought you were burglars.

					MOTHER
			Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.

	Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.

					BRENDA
			See how you're getting on ...

					STEED
			Something in the wind?

	Mother wheels himself from the study.  Taps a barometer.  It whirls around.

					MOTHER
			Weather's turning nasty.

					STEED
			You didn't come to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh yes I did. I want you to meet
			somebody.
				(off Steed's look)
			I expect you'll like her.

	Brenda coolly files her nails.  A flash of jealousy.

					STEED
			'Her'?


45      INT.  EMMA'S FLAT (PRIMROSE HILL) - DAY

	A groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).  Bach PIANO MUSIC floats in the
	air.

	Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.  On the piano, a framed
	picture of her late husband.  And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine.

	A KNOCK.  Emma gets up, goes to the door.  The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, keys
	jumping up and down automatically, as --


46      AT DOOR

	Emma flicks open a large automated eye.  Peers thru.  Opens


47      IN CORRIDOR

	A MESSENGER (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow.

					MESSENGER
			Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you ...

	Emma shuts the door.  Unties the bow, opens up  Finds an embossed card:

					EMMA
				(reads)
			'Please answer the Telephone.'

	Emma looks: The phone sits there.

	Just then ... RING-RING.  Emma goes over, picks up the phone.  A recorded message,
	an upper-class woman's voice:

					WOMAN (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m.
			Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club,
			the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
			Steed ...

	BEEP.  The phone goes dead.  Emma opens up the case.  Unveils a brace of kippers.
	Puzzled, she holds up a fish.

					EMMA
			Kippers ...?


48      EXT.  BOODLE-S CLUB (PALL MALL) - DAY

	Near the Mall, outside white stucco buildings, a Lotus Elan pulls up and parks as a car
	conveniently leaves, cutting off another angry CAR.  HONK!  A dash clock says 2:15.
	Out gets --

	-- Emma Peel, different attire.  She climbs steps.  On a brass plaque, "Boodles
	Gentlemen's Club."  She goes in, passing --

	-- an astonished uniformed commissionaire.


49      INT.  BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised.

					PORTER
			May I help you, madam ...

					EMMA
			Mr. John Steed, please.

					PORTER
			I'm afraid that's impossible.

					EMMA
			Impossible?

	The Porter points to a notice:  "No non-members.  No animals.  No women."

					PORTER
			You are female?

					EMMA
			As you see.

					PORTER
			Then you can't come in.

					EMMA
			I have an appointment.

					PORTER
			No women. Not in Boodles. Not
			since 1922.

					EMMA
			Really -- what happened in 1922?

	Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.  Old mahogany, portraits of dead
	politicians, leather chairs.  A male enclave.

	The Porter rushes up to restrain her.

	Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends. 
	The Porter winces and --

					EMMA
			Thank you so much. I can find Mr.
			Steed myself ...

	-- collapses on the ground in agony.  Emma ignores him.  Pushes thru double doors,
	upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into


50      INT.  BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY

	Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room

	Steed sits naked save for a towel.  He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees --

	Emma before him.  Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction.

					STEED
			Doctor Peel, I presume?

					EMMA
			And you must be Steed. Please
			don't get up.

	He doesn't.  HISSING STEAM between them as they study.

					STEED
			I was about to throw in the towel.

					EMMA
			I had a spot of bother at the door.

					STEED
			I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman
			inside Boodles since --

					EMMA
			1922. Why the kippers?

					STEED
			Red herring would have been too
			obvious, don't you think?

					EMMA
				(looks around)
			So what was all this -- some sort
			of test?

					STEED
			Congratulations, you've penetrated a 
			bastion of male privilege. I guessed 
			you weren't a stickler for Tradition, 
			doctor.

					EMMA
			Whereas you are.

					STEED
			Dyed in the wool. But I can admire 
			someone who doesn't play by the 
			rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					STEED
			Not by me. Play by the rules,
			Doctor, or the game is nothing.

					EMMA
			And just what is the game?

					STEED
			I say, this is all terribly formal.  
			Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?

					EMMA
				(re:  the steamroom) 
			Under the circumstances, you may 
			call me Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Much better.

					EMMA
			And now that we've settled the matter 
			of honorifics, will you kindly explain 
			why you wished me to meet you?

					STEED
			I didn't. Mother did.

					EMMA
			Mother?

	Steed steps closer, smiling.

					STEED
			I expect you'll like him.

	Off Emma's reaction --


51      EXT.  THAMES RIVER (NEAR WHITEHALL) - DAY

	CAR ROAR OVER.  Down the embankment Parliament and Big Ben in b.g., the sleek
	Jaguar zooms at 60mph.  Steed dodges traffic --

	Wearing racing goggles, windscreen down --

	Executes a nifty maneuver, swerves on a zebra crossing, scatters pedestrians,
	HONKING his HORN.  Beside him, Emma is cool as a cucumber.  Steed turns
	charmingly.

					STEED
			Tea time -- four o'clock.  Mustn't
			be late.
				(beat)
			A word of warning. Don't take the
			macaroon. Mother's favorite.

	Steed swerves down a narrow alleyway, into a secret car park entrance by the
	riverbank.  He pulls up before a sign:

			RIVER THAMES WATER AUTHORITY
					No Admittance

	At a control barrier Steed inserts a card.  Emma sees a light flash up: "Security -- Top
	Priority Clearance Only."  The barrier lifts.  She looks again at Steed, reappraising him
	as Big Ben approaches four.  The car disappears in darkness ...

52      LARGE WINDOW CURTAIN

	opens, revealing water!  We are beneath the Thames -- garbage and fish float past a
	window of reinforced glass.  An original Campbell's tomato soup can floats down as we
	WIDEN to reveal ...

53      INT. SECRET SERVICE HQ - UNDERWATER - DAY

	Mother in his wheelchair, pulling the curtain cord.

					MOTHER
			That's better. I much prefer a
			womb with view, don't you, Mrs.
			Peel?

	A delicate CLOCK on the mantel CHIMES FOUR.

	Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle.

					MOTHER
			Shall I be mother?

	He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web, known as The
	Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels.

	Catches Emma's wandering lock

					MOTHER
			I expect you're wondering where
			you are.

	An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -- Emma takes
	her tea ...

					EMMA
			Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret 
			service. You're so hushhush, even the 
			legit secret service knows nothing about 
			it. Am I right?

	Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming with fancies
	over to Emma and Steed.

					MOTHER
			Close. We're so hush-hush, even
			we know nothing about it.
				(before Emma can
				make sense of this) 
			Now let's see, there's coconut cake, 
			date and walnut; I recommend the 
			rum baba ...

					EMMA
			Hmmm ...

					MOTHER
			Looks like rain, Steed...

					STEED
			... Showers followed by sunny periods.

					EMMA
				(looks up from
				trolley)
			We're not here to talk about the
			weather, surely.

					MOTHER
			Oh, yes we are.

					BRENDA
				(to Emma, cunning)
			Macaroon?

	Emma hesitates; takes a cake.  About to take a bite, when --

	Mother switches off lights.  A screen drops, covering the water window as the mood
	changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient PROJECTOR RATTLES on ...

54      IN DARKNESS

	Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the
	English countryside:

					MOTHER
			We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.  
			We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into 
			the field for data. Case number one: 
			April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins 
			investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.  
			A field outside the village of Little Snoring, 
			one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped 
			by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death 
			in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in 
			perma-frost.
				(the picture changes)
			Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M. 
			Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, 
			investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak 
			rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a 
			flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five 
			inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size 
			of a cricket pitch ...
				(the picture changes)
			... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief 
			Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip 
			field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins 
			recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, 
			temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous 
			combustion. Not much of him left ...

	CLICK.  The lights go back on.  Emma notices - a new arrival
	
	a tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.

					MOTHER
			My number two. Special assignments.  
			She's --

					EMMA
			Let me guess -- 'Father'?

					FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)
			All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.

	Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.  Runs her fingers over Emma's face. 
	Gets the outline.  Emma realizes --

					EMMA
			You're --

	Blind ... Father smiles.

					FATHER
			God, you're quick.

					MOTHER
			Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --

	He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed investigates a
	pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.  The shoes have agent Simkins' name
	in them ...

					STEED
			Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My
			shoemaker.

					EMMA
				(unimpressed)
			A kipper. Or a red herring? What were 
			they investigating?

					FATHER
			A series of bizarre shifts in local weather 
			patterns ...

					STEED
			Global warming?

					FATHER
			Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush 
			English village transformed overnight 
			into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?

					EMMA
			How curious ...

					MOTHER
			Something strange is happening. And 
			whoever knows about it doesn't want 
			us to find out.

					FATHER
				(to Steed)
			Your mission is simple. Find out
			how and why these agents died.

					EMMA
			I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?

					MOTHER
			Your research into climate engineering was 
			state-of-the-art. Your experiments could 
			have revolutionized our knowledge of global 
			warming -- had they succeeded. We need 
			your expertise.

					STEED
			Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor 
			again, Mrs. Peel --

	Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ...

					EMMA
			I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.  
			I've been out of action for some time. I'll 
			consider your proposal.

	She gets up, ready to go.

					FATHER
			One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another 
			special reason we wanted you to join our 
			happy family; rather curious, actually ...

	Mother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification,
	identikit sketches.

					MOTHER
			Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.  
			One description tallied in all three places.  
			Recognize her?

	Emma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts.

					EMMA
			Me, isn't it?

	Emma stares at the screen: incredible.  Like a twin sister.

					FATHER
			Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.  
			With a twist. You're our chief suspect.

					EMMA
			You're saying I have no choice.

					MOTHER
			Father will be your controller. Steed here 
			will show you the ropes.

					EMMA
				(very arch)
			Ropes?

			Think she really killed those agents?

			Possibly. Split personality ...

					STEED
			Insane ... ?

					STEED
			Why?

					MOTHER
			She may try to kill you.


57      IN SHOOTING GALLERY

	Emma swiftly turns, aims, and --

	BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision. 
	All on target.  Steed reacts.  Ulp.

					STEED
			Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr. 
			Darling.

58      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM

	A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie
	(1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed. 
	The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show.

	As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a
	kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard,
	Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air.

					DR. DARLING
			One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
			she's obsessively devoted to the memory 
			of her husband the scientist Peter Peel. 
			You may find her a little ... remote.

	Images of Peter Peel on the wall.  Of Emma with him.

					DR. DARLING
			They were a team. Met at Cambridge. 
			Working on a top secret research mission 
			into weather conditions, code name The
			Prospero Project, when Peel died.

	Steed looks meaningfully at Mother.

					MOTHER
			Something went wrong. System malfunction.  
			Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.  
			Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File 
			still open.

					STEED
			How come you took so much interest
			in her, Dr. Darling?

					DR. DARLING
			Her husband was one of ours.

					STEED
				(eyes Peel's photo,
				then Mother)
			Peel? Did she know?

					MOTHER
			Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She 
			was in a dangerous game, Steed. High 
			stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If 
			she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.

					STEED
			Anyone particular in mind?

					MOTHER
			You.

	OFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ...


59      INT.  SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON

	Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.  Like everything else she does, Emma is a
	champion.  Steed is hard put.  Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech 
	dueling ...

	Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black ... yin and yang ...

					STEED
			You're a lady of hidden talents,
			Mrs. Peel ...

	Tic-tac ...

					EMMA
			I've no intention of hiding them ...

	Tic-tac ...

					STEED
			Scientist ...
				(tic-tac)
			... marksman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... swordsman ...
				(tic-tac)
			... To what do you attribute your 
			overachievements?

	Fast swordplay.  Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic.  Steed's good, too.

					EMMA
			My father always wanted a boy.

					STEED
			Really?  I fail to see the connection.

					EMMA
			I had a feeling you would. Touche!

	She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest.  BUZZ!  Steed removes
	his mask; holds her foil tip.

					STEED
			I take your point.

	Emma takes off her mask.

					EMMA
			Do you?

					STEED
			Yes indeed. I need protection.


60      EXT.  SIGN - DAY

	"Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street, since 1756."  Steed's Jag parked in front -- of course
	there's a space.  Getting out

					EMMA
			I thought we were on our way.

					STEED
			Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man 
			worth meeting. No point setting out 
			half shod.

					EMMA
				(dry)
			Or half cocked.

61      CLOSEUP - TRUBSHAW

	slips Steed's hand-made shoes an.  The "lasts" shapes of shoes beside him -- bear
	Steed's name.

					STEED
			I couldn't agree more. Thank you, 
			Trubshaw.

					TRUBSHAW
				(significantly)
			Very good, Mr. Steed.

	WIDEN to reveal:


62      INT.  TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY

	A bull moose's antlers.  A horned rhino.  A Leopard.  A tiger.  Then next to them, in a
	wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently beneath them.  Shop assistants attend
	in tails and wing-collars, very old school tie.  Steed emerges helped into a new flashy
	waistcoat ...

					EMMA
				(gags at the waistcoat)
			Steed, we really must be --

					STEED 
				(relishing his shoes)
			Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a 
			hand-made shoe. As unique as a face 
			or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?


63      BEHIND DISPLAY

	Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise ...

					EMMA
			You can but I wish you wouldn't ...

					STEED
			Thank you, Trubshaw ...

	A youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, smart suit, druggy
	high-pitched giggle.  BAILEY, a cocky, cool psychopath.  He watches Steed and
	Emma leave ...

	... and saunters after them ...  CAR ROAR OVER.


64      EXT.  LONDON STREETS - DAY

	as the Jag races through them, heading for the country.

					EMMA (V.O.)
			That place is so absurd, so out of date ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Do you really think so?

	Another car follows them ... as they pass Buckingham Palace, now painted pink and
	guarded by female grenadiers ...

65      SIGN

	reading:  "Scotland" with an arrow, as Steed and Emma zoom past in the Jag ...

					STEED (V.O.)
			Press that button, would you?
			Tea?

66      CLOSEUP - SPECIAL DASHBOARD COMPARTMENT

	opens, revealing a tea service: a samovar of tea, feeding into a pre-warmed pot,
	pouring into two china cups ...

	WIDEN to reveal:

67      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar ...

					STEED
			Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt
			your flow of oratory ...


	Steed's JAG BACKFIRES again as at the beginning ...

					EMMA
			You know what I mean. This car
			-- and you. Nobody walks around
			like that. Milk?

					STEED
			Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.
			Peel. No thank you.

	She hands over a cup.

					EMMA
			But why? What's the point?

					STEED
			A Gentleman has to have a code.
			This is part of mine. A uniform.
			Think of it as my suit of shining
			armor.

					EMMA
			And I suppose you're the knight.

					STEED
			The most unpredictable piece on
			the board. And always ready to
			protect his queen.

					EMMA
			That's predictable. When I find
			a queen in need of protection
			I'll let you know.

	Steed looks in the mirror.  Behind them, a car.  Tailing?

					STEED
			I'm hoping you will.

	He puts his foot down.  Zoom ...


68      EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Towards picturesque Scotland.  The JAG ROARS by - then the other car ...


69      INT.  JAG - DAY

	Emma consults a list, reads --

					EMMA
			Sir August Merryweather ... why
			are we seeing him first?

					STEED
			As per mother's instructions.

					EMMA
			Do we always follow Mother's
			instructions?

					STEED
			For a man in my position --

					EMMA
			Just what is your position, if you don't 
			mind my asking.  How did a stuffed 
			shirt like you get into this line of work?

					STEED
				(smiles)
			They call me in when they've reached a 
			dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.

					EMMA
			I have no choice. Why should you
			risk your life?

					STEED
			After our fencing match, I was rather 
			hoping you would do the risking.  
			More tea?

					EMMA
			No thanks.

					STEED
			I meant me.

	Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.  Sighing, she pours.


70      EXT.  HIGHLANDS - DAY

	The Jag winds around Loch Ness, followed by the car.

					STEED (V.O.)
			According to Mother, Sir August owns 
			half of the Highlands. A millionaire.  
			Former head of Special Projects at the 
			Ministry. Now ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			An eccentric recluse?


71      INT.  JAG - DAY

					STEED
			Not so much eccentric. More barking 
			mad. He has a wife called June. And 
			a daughter somewhere -- Julie.

					EMMA
			June, July ... August?

					STEED
			The family does seem to be somewhat 
			meteorologically inclined.

					EMMA
			Any other vices?

					STEED
			All of a piece, really. A fanatical 
			weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.
				(off her look)
			British Royal Organisation For
			Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British 
			weather has been tampered with 
			by ... aliens.

	Emma takes this in.

					EMMA
			So ... I distract him while you snoop 
			around? How?

					STEED
			Small talk.  Try the weather.


72      EXT.  HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

	Steed and Emma speed up to the huge open main gates

	Signs:  "Private: No Admittance."  Guards in hunting gear and plus fours, with loaded
	rifles.  They start up the drive ...

	Several peacocks on the lawn fan open their beautiful tails.

	One of them, a mechanical peacock whose thousand eyes CLICK with the WHIR of a
	CAMERA ...

	The other car pulls in behind. Inside, reveal Bailey watching them.


73      INT.  MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

	On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES
	on the floor.  PAN UP to reveal:

	A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor --

	-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit
	with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor.

					EMMA
			Original ...

					BUTLER
			This way, miss ...

					EMMA
			Missus ...

	He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into


74      INT.  A LARGE ROOM

	of semi-tropical climate.  Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.  Walls lined with display
	cabinets and bell jars:  stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.  A thermometer reads:

	100 degrees with high humidity. The Butler leaves.

	Emma fans herself.  Nobody in the roam.  But hears a sound of RAINFALL from a
	smoked glass conservatory.

					EMMA
			Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Eh? In here!

	Emma follows the SOUND, steps cautiously forward.

75      INT.  CONSERVATORY

	beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain, an old man splashes in bizarre rubber togs.
	Emma stays cool.

					EMMA
			I've come to apply for membership
			in Brolly --

					SIR AUGUST
				(shouts above the tempest)
			You don't get rain like you used to in 
			England. A good shower that's the ticket.  
			Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells 
			the namby-pamby in a man.

	SIR AUGUST steps out of the shower and wind machine.  A belted rubber macintosh,
	flippers, goggles.  He starts to disrobe, the NOISE DIES DOWN --

					EMMA
			I so agree. How did you acquire a 
			taste for it?

					SIR AUGUST
			Out in India. So character-forming for the 
			British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The 
			rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen 
			inches overnight. A whole week of lovely 
			rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...

	Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her.

					SIR AUGUST
			You

					EMMA
			Have we met?

					SIR AUGUST
			You mean you don't recall??

	Before Emma can reply, the door opens...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, Lady June ...

	Emma's attention switches to LADY JUNE, a buxom lady in a sou'wester and galoshes,
	who wheels in a tray of scones.

					LADY JUNE
			Dear August.  Loves his showers.
			Like a baby.
				(beat)
			Scones, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			Thank you, Lady -- June ...

	Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is rapidly 
	darkening ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.

					EMMA
			Promised? Who promised?

					SIR AUGUST
			There, look!

	Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows.  Emma exchanges looks
	with June as the rain starts pouring.

					SIR AUGUST
			Imagine being caught out in a blow 
			like that!

76      EXT.  MOORLAND - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning -- Steed is caught out in it; puts up his umbrella; wanders
	over the brow of a hill, past a big sign:  "No Trespassers."  Rains more.  And more.
	Turns to a tempest, as --

					STEED
			I say, this is a bit much.

	Lashed by rain ' Steed carries on to the brow of the hill.  He looks over, peers through
	the mist at --

	A deep purple cloud.  Mushrooming towards him.

	Steed can't escape it.  It envelops him.  Starts to blink.  Cough.  Footsteps less sure. 
	Surrounded by thick purple haze

	Steed stumbles and falls

	Down a hill.  Tumbles to the bottom.  He knocks his head on a rock.  Steed blinks,
	shakes his head.  Eyes refocus.  He sees


77      UNDULATING SAND DUNES

	Sun shining down on yellow sand, a barren vista.  Dead trees.  Suddenly Steed's in the
	Sahara.  A heat haze shimmers.

	Steed blinks, thinks he's dreaming when he sees ...


78      IN DISTANCE - RED PHONE BOX

	Steed heads towards it.  The PHONE BOX seems further away.  Like an optical
	illusion.  Then hears RINGING.

	Steed still bowler-hatted.  Overcoat.  Perspiring.  Takes off bowler, wipes brow. 
	Adjusts rose in buttonhole.  It wilts.

	He arrives at the phone box. Opens the door.  Steed picks up the RINGING PHONE,
	listens to --

	A SCRATCHY ORCHESTRAL RECORDING of "The Merry Widow."

					STEED
			'The Merry Widow'...?

	Over the MUSIC, a strange --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			... Hello ... Hello? ... Who the
			hell...? Who is this? ... You must
			leave the test area. I repeat,
			leave the area ... Help is on the
			way ...

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Steed is baffled.  Steps out, sees --


79      ON HORIZON

	a shimmering heat haze.  A figure on a camel moving towards them.  Steed watches
	amazed, as the camel pads closer ...

	The mirage arrives. The rider dismounts. A woman in yashmak and veils. She draws
	closer. Drops the veils to reveal --

	Emma Peel.  In her black leather catsuit.

					.STEED
			Mrs. Peel. Good of you to drop by. 
			And I see you're wearing your - 
			riding outfit?

	Emma moves closer.  Steed smiles at her.  Emma closer and -- chop! -- gives a kung-fu
	jab to the throat, a kick to the balls, a jab to the stomach.  As Steed lies on the 
	ground --

					STEED
			Manners, Mrs. Peel.

	Emma takes out a .38 GUN, points at his heart, FIRES -- 

	BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  FOUR SHOTS --


80      EMMA'S POV

	-- The bullets strike his chest.  Round his heart.  Steed slumps back on the sands.  Eyes
	close ...


81      EMMA

	moves over him. Drops a small toy snowshaker into his curled fingers. Blows a good
	bye kiss.


82      STEED'S POV	82

	The sun.  Clouds roll by.  The camel peers down at him.

									
		FADE TO BLACK.

	Sound of CLACKING ...

	FADE IN:

83      INT.  SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY

	A hospital ward.  Empty apart from one bed.  A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her
	spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to

	Steed in a hospital bed.  Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.  Peering over him.  Very
	nonchalant.  Eating his grapes.

					STEED
			Ah, Brenda ...
				(as she leaves)
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			You should be dead.  How do you
			feel?

					STEED
				(eyes her)
			Strange.

					EMMA
			You were very lucky.  Four shots to 
			the heart. I found you after I slipped 
			away from Sir August. Mother brought 
			you here. Not me you should thank.

					STEED
			I wasn't about to.

					EMMA
			I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your
			bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought 
			you were just overdressed.

					STEED
			I might say the same.

84      FROM GALLERY

	Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.  Emma looks up at them.  Drops to a whisper. 
	But they both are wearing headphones.

					EMMA
			Mother and Dr. Darling have me 
			under observation. They think I 
			tried to kill you.

					STEED
			Why should they think that?

					EMMA
			You told them. You said I arrived 
			on a camel, shot you four times. 
			Left you for dead.

					STEED
			Frankly that's how I remember it.

					EMMA
			But that's absurd. I may not be 
			over-fond of you, Steed, but it's 
			not my style.

					STEED
			Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
			Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
				(conceding)
			That's possible. Sir August was convinced 
			he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.  
			Another odd thing. When it rained, he said 
			it was just as someone had promised.

					STEED
			Did he say who?

					EMMA
			No. But he must know. Incidentally, 
			my double left you with this.

	Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.  A winter wonderland snow scene.  He looks
	puzzlingly at it.  On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by --

					STEED
			An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?

					EMMA
			Did you say formal? I must dress.


85      EXT.  LONDON STREET - NIGHT

	The sporty Jag pulls up outside a tall, swanky building.  Steed gets out, opens her door.
	Irritated, Emma steps out of the car, clad in her leather suit --


86      CLOSEUP OF HER HEEL

	hitting the street.   PAN UP TO Steed, admiring --

					STEED
			I must say, you look more your
			old self --

					EMMA
			You mean my other self ...

					STEED
			Either way ... may I ask: why
			you dress in that fashion?

					EMMA
			I should have thought that was
			obvious ...
				(off his smirk)
			I'm in mourning.

	She moves off.  Stay on his poker face.

					STEED
			I can't wait to see afternoon.

	He joins her; they survey the building.

					EMMA
			Where's the picnic?

	They look up to --


87      INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

	A boardroom suite, overlooking London.  Lights twinkling --

	Around a conference table.  Twelve TEDDY BEARS.  Each six feet tall.  Ridiculous
	and sinister.  In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.  Furry, giant paws and
	ears, swivel eyes.  One teddy sports a familiar tartan ...

	On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes. 
	And wrapped presents before each.

	Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. pinned to
	their fur.  A children's tune, "THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC," plays.  Followed by -
	a gavel rapping order.

	A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which ECHOES through our
	story --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...

	The teddy bears look round.  Can't hear who's talking.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Today is history. The first day of the future. 
			I welcome you to the first general meeting 
			of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied 
			with our colleagues from Brolly ...

	Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			You have all given time, money and expertise 
			to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a 
			new phase of our operation. From today, 
			many of you will no longer be needed. I have 
			to warn you ...

	Dismay from the teddy bears.  As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT,

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			A cuckoo.  The first sign of spring, and ... 
			A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is 
			no longer secret. Agents are investigating 
			us. Their names are John Steed and Emma 
			Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us 
			... perhaps more than one ...

	Uproar from the teddy bears.  Shouts of "Who?" (*PS: One of the Teddys is a giant
	rabbit who seems especially alarmed).

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			That remains to be seen. When we find 
			the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.

					TEDDY BEAR #l
			These agents.  Where are they?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Here. In this building. By our estimate, they 
			will enter this room in thirty-five point five 
			seconds precisely ...

	Panic.  The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other.

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I am sorry the party is over.  But we 
			shall meet again.
			To each of you a gift. A token of
			my appreciation.

	In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink
	and silver bow.

	The tartan teddy opens his up:  A snow scene.  Anxious moans.


88      INT.  BUILDING - NIGHT

	UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to the
	conference room.  The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.  To FIND an empty room.
	Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the
	teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING again OVER ...

	One snow shaker left.  Steed picks it up:  Inside it:


89      TINY EMMA PEEL

	in black leather.

					STEED (O.S.)
			For you, Mrs. Peel.


90      BACK TO SCENE

	Emma stares at it.  Turns it over:  an address.

					EMMA
			Another invitation. 38 Marlborough
			Terrace ...


91      INT.  EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT

	Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.  A dilapidated hammer and sickle
	tapestry in tatters.  Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms.

	Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside.

	They search for clues.  A cigar left in an ashtray.  Steed picks it up with distaste. 
Then   moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne --

					STEED
				(admiringly)
			Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ...
				(then puzzled)
			But he bites the end of his
			Monte Cristos ... ?
				(frowning)
			Clearly, we're dealing with a
			maniac.

	Meanwhile, Emma goes into the --


92      NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV

	where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.  A few
	pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit.


93      BACK TO SCENE

	Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk.

					STEED
			Colonel Crabtree. International
			Satellite Systems. Formerly of
			the Ministry.

					EMMA
			How on earth can you tell?

	Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:  the name.

					STEED
			Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw
			isn't the only shoemaker still
			practicing his trade ...

					EMMA
			Very good, Steed ...

	A MEWLING SOUND.

					EMMA
			What's that?

	Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into


94      ANOTHER ROOM

	Dark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps.


95      STEED

	looks up as Emma emerges with - 

	A Leopard cub.  Steed raises his brolly.

					STEED
			What on earth?

					EMMA
			Any ideas?

					STEED
			Well, he was a fellow of the Royal
			Zoological Society ...

					EMMA
			Is that written in his shoe?

					STEED
				(smug)
			Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(shrugs)
			She had this in her mouth. There,
			there...

	Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.  Inside -- another
	address:  84 Cadogan Place.

					STEED
			Not again.  There's got to be
			another. way to go about this.


96      EXT.  CADOGAN PLACE APARTMENT BUILDING (KNIGHTSBRIDGE) -
	NIGHT

	Down a sheer wall Emma Peel abseils with rope and crampons.  Before gliding through
	an open French window --


97      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	Emma investigates.  Nobody there.  She looks 'round.  Military memorabilia.  Busts of
	Napoleon and Charlemagne.  Looks inside drawers.  Desks.  Meanwhile --


98      INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... licking, pawing him ...

					STEED
			Now, now ...
				(sings)
			'I can't give you anything but
			love, baby...'


99      INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT	

	Emma searching ...


100     OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR	100

		a key in lock.  Door opens.  Silence.


101     INSIDE - EMMA

	finds a snowshaker.  About to look underneath.  Hears a NOISE.  Looks up, in front of
	her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.  Ready to strike --

	Emma swivels 'round,  a fluid balletic motion, and --

	Bam!  A kick to the teddy's stomach.  Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her
	shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as --

	The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.  She falls.  Teddy grabs a military
	sabre from the wall, and Woosh!  Slices through air at Emma's head.  She ducks.  The
	sabre skims her hair.  Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on!

	Emma counterattacks.  Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off! 
	Jesus.  The torso stands unsteadily.

	Emma's eyes widen as:

	A man's head emerges from the teddy torso.

	Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ...

	Emma's out.

102     INT.  STEED'S JAG - NIGHT

	so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.  A little milk dribbles down Steed's chin ...


103     INT.  KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT

	The man goes to the other room.  Starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume. 
	Throws clothes into a suitcase.

	The PHONE.  Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Naughty teddy ...

					MAN
			No! You can't ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings, it rings for thee ...

					MAN
			But I've got rid of her.  She's ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Go to the window ... To the window.

	Teddy moves to the open window.  Sudden PAIN.  LIGHTNING.

	Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.  Direct hit.  The
	teddy slumps to the ground.  Soggy, waterlogged, very dead.  Kinda like the
	other guy ...


104     IN OTHER ROOM

	Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, sees dead
	Teddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ...

					EMMA
			Major D'Arcy ... ?


105     OVER HER SHOULDER

	from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" --

	-- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.  She makes a NOISE.  Emma
	turns just in time to see.

					EMMA
			Well, well. If it isn't me ...

	Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window ...
	she wears the same black catsuit.

	The real Emma rushes, follows her "double"

	Clambers outside to rappel up the line to


106     EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

	Emma looks.  Beneath a starlit sky criss-crossed by wires, a rooftop maze of buildings,
	flanked by giant gargoyles -- goblins, lions, griffins -- over twinkling lights ...

	Emma searches the roof -- no sign, only shadows.  Then turns a corner to see --

	Above the city, fairy lights on the rooftops of Harrods, lit by a million bulbs ... giant
	neon signs ...

	Several floors below, Emma sees the streets.  A twinge of vertigo.  Then she looks up,
	hears a NOISE -- From:


107     BEHIND GARGOYLE

	she sees her "double" run.  Emma gives chase.

	Hot pursuit.  Over rooftops.  'Round wires.  PAST neon signs high over the city ...

	Emma follows.  Gains on the "double," who --

	Pushes faster.  Gliding between rooftop buildings.  Dodging, weaving.  But Emma
	gains more.  Sleek limbs, muscular, perfect body machine, until --


108     EMMA'S POV

	as she sees her "double" leap over a yawning chasm.  And stumble on the other side for
	a footing.


109     BACK TO SCENE

	as Emma's adrenaline surges.  She cannot stop, she --

	Jumps!  Hangs in the air.  Limbs pushing out for the edge.  And only just, she lands
	perfectly, gaining, closing, until --


110     ON NEXT ROOFTOP

	Emma gains up close.  A final burst of acceleration.  Then without warning, her
	"double" --

	Turns, Emma catches up, and --

	Wham!  Wham!  A kick -- a chop to Emma's body - double scissorkick -- Emma reacts
	swiftly, surges into overdrive --

	In a lightning-fast kung fu duel -- CRACK OF BONE -- CRUNCH OF BLOWS -- a
	flurry of kicks as Emma --

	Lands on her back.  The "double" attacks.  Emma retaliates --

	Kicks up her leg -- flings the "double" over her head she lands awkwardly -- a
	METALLIC CRUNCH in a blow to her head -- but picks herself up without pausing

	And vanishes into the rooftop maze.


111     AGAINST SKYLINE

	Emma stands.  Looks.   She's lost her "double."  She stands alone, silhouetted against
	the night sky.

	Caught in the moonlight.  Above sparks of neon.  Daunting, muscular, poised for
	action, as --

	Ears listening to distant noises.  SWOOSHING TRAFFIC.  FLUTTER of BIRD
	WING.  HUM of WIND through wires.  Then an AUDIBLE SNAP --

112     EMMA'S POV - HIGH ANGLE

	above her a SPAM as a STEEL CABLE WIRE of an aerial is snapped.  Slowly wound 
	tightly 'round, bent back, coiled, ready to spring --

113     BACK TO SCENE - EMMA

	looks 'round.  Sees nothing, hears the sound of the WHIPLASH coming seconds 
	before --

	Through the air --


114     EMMA'S POV

	a flashing line like a bolt of lightning, but cannot move quickly enough as --


115     BACK TO SCENE

	as a cable wire whips across, coils 'round Emma, lashing her tight, crushing air from
	her, as the wire --

	Sweeps Emma off her feet, whiplashes her back like a spring, hoists her and dangles her
	over the city.  She looks down.

	A long way.

	Emma grabs hold of the wire, which pulls her back.  She drops down to the rooftop ...

	Slithers down the roof.  Slips --


116     OVER LEDGE

	Emma hangs on with fingertips.

	Overlooking city with 100-foot neon sign above her:


117     ADVERTISEMENT

	for "Wonderland Weather" with: a repeated loop of a 100-foot high bikini-clad
	"Emma" throwing head back in holiday fun -- Sign: "COMING SOON -- THE
	NATURAL BEAUTY OF WONDERLAND WEATHER."


118     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma hangs on, looks up, stares at "herself."  The surreal repetition of the loop. 
	Overlooking the whole city.

	Dizzy, Emma threatens to pass out.  Just when from --


119     ABOVE HER

	an unseen hand from Bad Emma winds down --

	Another CABLE for her to hold.  It uncoils down past the windows, telltale SPARKS
	flare up as it hits metal --

	Emma tries to grab for it.  Misses, then grabs hold, and -- a LIVE CABLE -- a
	thousand VOLTS surge through her body --

	-- A shock, Emma plummets DOWN TO --


120     STRIPED AWNING

	on a lower ledge.  She hangs precariously.  Catching her breath.  About to redouble her
	efforts.  When beside her from a --


121     BALCONY WINDOW

	an umbrella extended.  Steed reaches out, reels Emma in.  They are back in Teddy's 
	flat ... Emma collapses in Steed's arms.  He helps her up -- hands her a phone.

					STEED
			For you, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Thanks ...
				(dry)
			I see what you mean about letting
			me do the risking ... Hello?

	It's Sir August.

					SIR AUGUST (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly.
			Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell
			you everything ... The weather's
			getting worse and worse ... they're
			after me ... coming for me ... come
			quickly!

	CLICK.

					EMMA
			Sir August...?
				(to Steed)
			What now?

					STEED
			Ask Mother.

	Sound OVER:  RING-RING.

122     INT.  MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY

	Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.  The scotty DOG BARKS.
	Finally, Sir August answers.

					SIR AUGUST
			Mrs. Peel -- ?

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Ask not for whom the telephone
			rings ...

					SIR AUGUST
			No, please! I beg you ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Walk over to the window ...

					SIR AUGUST
			Let it be rain, please let it be --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			Stay by the window. By the window.

	Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late.


123     OUTSIDE

	a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.  A luminous glow.  Then a
	LIGHTNING STRIKE. And --

	BOOM!  An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.  A WIND rushes
	in ...

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Emergency alert ...


124     EXT.  WHITEHALL STREETS - DAY

	PAST obscure imperial statues a tiny micro Messerschmidt bubble car tootles down
	deserted streets.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			A cyclone hit Banffshire last night.
			Completely unpredicted ...


125     INSIDE CAR

					EMMA
			Where's Mother?

					FATHER
			Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't 
			take chances. I'm looking after 
			things while he's hiding out ...

	Father drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease.

					FATHER
			You're probably wondering how I 
			can drive 'blind.' Simple. A new 
			prototype from the boys in X division.  
			Micro-sensors in the system read 
			signals and road information. Converts 
			the info into miles per hour. 
			Ultra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.

	Father jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. 
	Steed holds onto his hat.

					STEED
			We know one thing. That suspect
			was not Mrs. Peel.

					FATHER
			So you say ... 

					EMMA
			You don't believe him?

					FATHER
			It's Mother you have to convince.
			He's very agitated.  Wait here.

	Father SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue

	Steed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ...

					EMMA
			But

					STEED
			Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...

	A red London number 22 bus drives up.  As it arrives, in a conductor's cap is -- the
	bodyguard, Brenda.

					BRENDA
			Fares, please,


126     INT.  BUS - DAY

	Steed and Emma board the bus.  Destination:  Not In Service.  They pay Brenda, the
	conductor.  Go upstairs.


127     UPSTAIRS

	is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.  He squats in a corner.  Metal hooks on electronic
	panels.  Now paranoid.  Suspicious.  All the upper windows have been blacked out.

					MOTHER
			Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's 
			turning quite nasty. Sir August was 
			blown to smithereens. Along with 
			half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's 
			worried.

					EMMA
			He tried to warn us ...

					STEED
			We had a lead to Wonderland
			Weather but we got there too late.
			Someone tipped them off ...

					MOTHER
			Too late anyway. Today's escapade 
			was only for starters. This is no 
			ordinary weather. It's manmade. A 
			kind of weather bomb.

					STEED
			Impossible.

					EMMA
			Not quite. This is my field.

					STEED
			Is there anything that isn't?

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			The Prospero Project was started by 
			my husband. It was an early attempt 
			to solve the problems of global warming.  
			In theory, climate engineering is entirely 
			feasible. We thought of injecting a 
			chemical cocktail into the atmosphere 
			by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...

					STEED
			Filling in mother nature's blind
			spots ... ?

					EMMA
			Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts 
			to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.  
			Propane gas mostly. In small quantities 
			it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone 
			layer. But it proved impractical. 
			Too bulky ...

					STEED
			But if someone miniaturized the
			process...

					EMMA
			That's what we were working on.

					STEED
			Sounds as if someone's hijacked
			your research.

					MOTHER
			Would it be possible to use it for
			military purposes?

					EMMA
			Directed by laser. Bounced by
			satellite. Quite possible.

					STEED
			Where would they aim for?

	Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again. 
	No one pays any attention.

					MOTHER
			London. The World Council of Ministers 
			meets soon on global defence. If you can 
			control the weather, you control the world.

					EMMA
			After the cold war ...

					STEED
			The hot and cold war ...

	Sign "Grand Opening Soon."  WIDEN to reveal ...


128     EXT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	Steed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...


129     INT.  WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY

	A kind of space-age travel agency.  Steed enters.

	At the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.  Steed sneaks in, moves
	behind a screen, overhears --

	A man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist

					BAILEY
			New orders. The penultimate phase. 
			Now fully operational ...

	Steed moves away from them, pushes a set of double doors open, arrives inside --


130     INT.  WONDERLAND OFFICE - DISPLAY - DAY

	A long corridor surrounded by a presentation of --

	Virtual reality weather:  clouds, sunny vistas, lush meadows, desert.  And slogans: 
	"Be natural.  Act natural.  Think natural.  The natural beauty of Wonderland Weather."

	Steed reacts; the model is the same as Emma on the big neon sign near Harrods ...

	Steed finds a desk.  Inspects papers.  Sees a postcard of a large stately home.  He
	pockets it.  Then looks 'round to see --

	Bailey before him.  We recognize him as the young dandy trailing Steed.  Neither gives
	away the other.

					BAILEY
			We're not yet open for business,
			I'm afraid.

					STEED
			Shame. I was recommended. By a
			friend.

					BAILEY
			Really?

					STEED
			Sir August Merryweather? I was
			looking for something relaxing.
			Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?

					BAILEY
			Normally, we'd be eager to
			oblige --

					STEED
			Seriously?  

					BAILEY
			Of course. Natural weather delivered
			to your door on demand. Down your
			phoneline. For limited periods.

					STEED
			You don't say. How real does it feel?

					BAILEY
			As real as you wish. Hot or cold.
			Humid or dry. Anything you like.
			Within reason.

					STEED
			There are limits?

					BAILEY
			The technology is brand new. Soon 
			it will be more powerful. We 
			anticipate a huge demand. Leave us 
			your number. We'll be in touch.

					STEED
			No need. I'll call again.

	Steed raises his bowler.  Bailey watches him go.


131     EXT.  WONDERLAND OFFICES - STREET - DAY

	Steed emerges, stares at his postcard -- the stately home and:  
	"Headquarters, Wonderland Weather, Ltd." as --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			My car. I'll drive.


132     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Emma's LOTUS ELAN WHIZZES BY...

					STEED (V.O.)
			A day in the country ...


133     INT.  LOTUS - DAY

					EMMA
			Three agents killed by bad weather...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
				(ignores)
			Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret 
			defense establishment. A group of 
			eccentrics obsessed by weather ...

					STEED
			... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything 
			points to you.  No sisters?  No 
			undiscovered twin?

					EMMA
			Not that I know of.  Explanation?

					STEED
			According to Dr. Darling, you're a 
			psychopathic personality with 
			schizophrenic delusions, suffering from 
			recurring amnesia based on traumatic 
			repression, leading to outbursts of 
			anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.

	Steed lets it sink in.  Emma looks a little hurt.

					EMMA
			Is that what you think?

					STEED
			Oh, well ...
				(beat)
			Just my type, Mrs. Peel.


134     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - SEVERAL ANGLES - DAY

	The Lotus races 'round blind corners.  Hairpin bends.  Across a train at a level crossing,
	which just misses them --


135     INT. LOTUS - DAY

	Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks --

					STEED
			Do you always drive this fast?

					EMMA
			Have I trespassed on a male
			prerogative?
				(before his reply)
			We're being followed. I saw him
			at Trubshaw's ...

	Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.  Pulling up, trying to catch up.
	Emma glances in the mirror, and --

					EMMA
			Hold on ...

	Puts foot down.  ZOOM.  Extra ACCELERATION.  Steed's head pinned back to his
	seat.  Emma's hair tossed in the wind.


136     EXT.  COUNTRY LANES - DAY

	The Lotus twisting and turning.  The car behind always catches up.  Emma tries to
	shake it.  Gears up.  Mach force.  Over crossroads.  Shaking 'round corners, as ...


137     BEND

	before Emma pushes foot down.  Further ACCELERATION.  The car behind struggles
	to keep up.  Emma coasts ahead, turns a corner --

	And suddenly sees in front of her --


138     HUGE TRUCK

	crossing directly in their path!

					STEED
			Turn!


139     EMMA

	swerves, plunging the car into a haystack, where it is completely hidden as --


140     TRUCK

	clears in time for the following car, which keeps going.


141     ON HAYSTACK

	as Steed emerges, brushing off straw.  An old lady on a bicycle with a basket appears ...

					OLD LADY
			Are you alright, young man?

					STEED
			I think so, thank you so much ...

	A SQUEAL of TIRES as -

	The following car swerves back, stops and Bailey emerges, gun drawn as Steed and the
	Old Lady react ...

					BAILEY
				(relishing)
			Reach for the sky, pardner.

	Steed raises his hands.

					OLD LADY
			Oh, dear --

	To Steed's surprise, she pulls an Uzi from her basket and

	BANGBANGBANGBANG -- !  SPRAYS BULLETS into Bailey, who crumples, gun
	spinning along the tarmac.  Cute and sweetlooking, the Old Lady is unfazed.

					OLD LADY
			Cocky little bastard. I hope he
			was a baddy.

					STEED
			I feel sure of it.

					OLD LADY
			I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be
			on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?

					STEED
				(looks around)
			She was ...

	They start pulling away hay from the haystack ...

					OLD LADY
			You with Mother or Father?

					STEED
			Both, actually.

					OLD LADY
			Good. Glad to see they're together at last.  
			They don't get along. Promotion. Top job.  
			Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.

					STEED
				(not paying attention)
			You don't say.
				(mumbles)
			Like looking for a needle in a ...


142     INSIDE HAYSTACK

	Coughing.  Then Emma, sputtering straw as Steed's face appears.  He tries to conceal
	his relief at seeing her.

					STEED
			What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet
			breathing?

					EMMA
			Barely.

					STEED
			You will let me know if you find
			that queen who's in need of
			protection, won't you?

	He pulls her out.  She's annoyed.

143     OUTSIDE HAYSTACK

	Emma brushes herself off; pulls off a piece of straw.

					EMMA
				(holding it ruefully)
			This must be the last straw.

					STEED
				(takes one off
				her back)
			Here's the one that broke the
			camel's back.

					EMMA
			Someone didn't want us to get to
			the party.

					STEED
			I expect we'll have to gatecrash.

					OLD LADY
			I may be able to help you.


144     EXT.  STATELY HOME FROM POSTCARD - DAY

	comes to life.  Steed, Emma and the Old Lady survey ...

					STEED
				(checks postcard)
			Wonderland Weather Ltd.

					OLD LADY
			This way ...


145     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - GROTTO AND MAZE - DAY

	On a lawn, a peacock flares its thousand eye tail.  A MECHANICAL CLICK, its eyes
	conceal hidden cameras, recording Emma, Steed and the Old Lady, who've landed
	inside the walled grounds.  They move stealthily forward, unaware ...

					OLD LADY
			Over here ...

	The Old Lady waves them on.  They enter a tunnel into


146     MAZE

	Tall hedges surround Steed and Emma and the Old Lady on all sides.  They follow the
	path, slopes , round, curves, turns into hairpin bends and U-turns.  At first intrigued ...

	Then perplexed.  Emma leads the way, Steed following.  The Old Lady slips OUT OF
	VIEW.  Steed stops to pick a rose, puts it in his lapel.  Emma rushes ahead.

					EMMA
			Aha ... Yes ... It's clear now. A
			trapezoid shape, dictated by twin
			diagonal paths and a single
			curving path. A late Seventeenth
			Century design, originally for
			King William of Orange, copied...
			Ah ...

	Steed sees Emma slip 'round a corner.  He pursues her.  Glimpses her.  Then loses her.
	Another glimpse.  Sees her thru hedges, then seemingly --

	Thru the other side of the hedge.  In two places at once.

					STEED
			... Mrs. Peel? I think I'm seeing
			double again.

	Out of sight, Emma rushes on.  Around her, the hedges grow taller.  She seems to
	grow smaller.  Emma begins to realize things are not what they seem.  As she pushes
	her way thru --


147     FROM ABOVE

	the maze as a formal patter-n. Three tiny figures dart round.

									
	DISSOLVE THRU TO:


148     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	A pattern on a screen.  The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines.  Steed,
	Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots.  Someone, somewhere is watching
	them.  Laughter, then a familiar voice --

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Now this is more like it ...


149     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	Steed searches for an exit.


150     ANOTHER PART OF MAZE

	Emma sees a statue of a Butler.  Which springs to life.  Summons Emma.  She follows
	down a path strewn with leaves.

	As Emma steps on the leaves, she --

	Falls down -- a giant rabbit hole.


151     INT.  RABBIT HOLE

	Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland ...

					EMMA
			Steed ... !

					STEED (V.O.)
			Mrs. Peel ... ?


152     EXT.  MAZE - DAY

	The identical face of Emma on a marble statue, as --

	Steed studies the classical statue ...

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... ?

	Steed hears a noise, turns to see --

	Emma walking towards him.  She picks the rose from his lapel, slowly coils an arm
	around his neck.  Pulls Steed towards her, closes her eyes -- kisses him full an the
	mouth.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel ... !
				(more kiss)
			Mrs. Peel ...

	The kiss ends.  Steed recovers his composure, lips coated with her lipstick.  His tongue
	traces his lips; smarts ...

					STEED
			Your lipstick ...

	Poison.  He goes dizzy.  Steed collapses to the ground.


153     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the house, a grand hall.  Deserted.  A cobweb hangs from ceiling.  A velvet
	curtain tattered and torn.
	Emma.

	A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour.  Ahead, the real Emma sees --

	A giant staircase.  There on the stairs -- a glass eye.
	She picks it up.  Puts it in a pocket.  Emma goes --


154     UPSTAIRS

	Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase.  One of herself in ornate aristocratic
	regalia.


155     LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS

	Rooms on either side.  Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors.


156     INSIDE ROOMS

	A mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets ... ventriloquists'
	dummies... and ...

	Butterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness ...

	Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...

	Snow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils. 
	Emma picks up one snow scene.

	She shakes it.


157     EXT.  HOUSE

	as if in response, a storm gathers.  Shadowy clouds roll in.


158     IN MAZE

	A drop of rain starts to fall.  Steed's eyes flicker open.

					STEED
				(re: rain)
			Not again.

	He rises, looks down, reacts --

	Alice, the Old Lady, lies near him in the maze, her neck snapped... Steed kneels, next to
	her in the rain

					OLD LADY
			It's a trap. Tell Mother, beware.
			Tell Father.

	She dies in his arms.

	Wind picks up, too.

	Steed looks about, frowning with discouragement --


159     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL   PLAYROOM - DAY

	THUNDER and lightning outside.  Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD
	TUNE PLAYS.  Emma shakes the snow scene.  The weather seems to grow darker.


160     FROM BEHIND

	Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:

					VOICE (V.O.)
			I wouldn't shake that too hard.
			The weather might turn nasty.

	From the shadows ... a man.  A silhouette.  Behind a distorting lens.  His shape and
	face unclear.  Emma puts down the shaker.

					EMMA
			Quite a collection.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			If nature gives a man a collector's mind, 
			it doesn't matter what he collects.  
			Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. 
			A true collector grows more obsessive 
			as the years pass.

	Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...

					EMMA
			Your voice -- it's so familiar ...

					VOICE (V.O.)
			We have met ...

	From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing:

	Peter Peel, Emma's husband!  THUNDER.

					EMMA
			Peter ... ?

	Instinctively Emma moves towards him.  A long pause.

					EMMA
			I must be dreaming ...

	Emma pulls back.  Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart. 
	BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...

					PETER
			Listen... Very much alive.

	Peter touches her hand.  Emma looks into his eyes.  Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief. 
	Peter raises her hand to his lips.

					PETER
			Darling, it's me...

	Emma shudders, battles with herself.

					EMMA
			Peter ...

	Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.


161     CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES

	Inside her pupil --

									
		FLASH CUTS TO:


162     MEMORY FLASHES

	His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass
	obscuring his face.


163     BACK TO SCENE

					EMMA
			Impossible ... how?

	Peter smiles disarmingly.  As if the answer was obvious.

					PETER
			For you ... all for you ...

	Peter comes over, folds her in his arms.  Takes her head between his hands.  Emma
	leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until --

	Lips parted.  Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --

					PETER
			Don't be afraid, darling.

	She turns, runs to the door.  Like a trapped bird.  She tries the door -- locked.  Another
	door -- locked.  A window -- locked.

					PETER
			Don't run away. I forgive you, 
			Emma. I know you left me. But 
			I still love you. Do you still have 
			my ring? I need it.

	Peter grabs hold of Emma.  She pulls away.  Emma sees his face before her, pleading
	with her.  Seductive yet nightmarish.

	As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --

	The big window overlooking the gardens.  She runs, leaps, and in SLOW MOTION --

	Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, as she --


164     EXT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - WINDOW - DAY

	somersaults through the window down to the ground.  Lands with a THUD on the wet
	ground.  Looks up to see --

	Steed above her, the STORM RAGING.

					EMMA
			Steed!

	She struggles to her feet, comes towards him, upset.

					STEED
			Oh, no. First time, shame on
			you. Third time, shame on me.

	He slugs her and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			Diagnosis confirmed.  Mrs. Peel is 
			suffering from delusions and 
			hallucinations. An extreme personality 
			disorder. She imagines her husband 
			Peter Peel has come back to her ...

	CLOSE ON Emma's face.

					DR. DARLING (V.O.) 
			A classic syndrome, to overcome her 
			subconscious guilt at her other crimes.  
			We've attached her to the dreamscape 
			machine. We'll soon see what her 
			unconscious looks like...

	Emma's eyes flicker...

	Steed comes INTO FOCUS, sitting by Emma's bed.  This time he's eating her grapes ...

	Emma looks around ... Everything blurs.  A STEADY PULSE DRONE.  Tugs at
	leather straps.  No use.  WIDEN to reveal Emma strapped to a special couch --

	Her head surrounded by a plastic dome, terminals and wires leading out into a
	Dreamscape machine.  Drowsy, disoriented.

					EMMA
			Where am I?

					STEED
			The Winslow Home for Retired
			Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry
			I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please
			forgive me. I thought you were
			someone else ...

					EMMA
			Was I?

					STEED
				(no smile)
			I expect that's for you to know
			and me to find out ...

					EMMA
			It was Peter -- I saw him ...

	Drugged, Emma's eyes drop.  FOCUS CHANGES TO --


165     ABOVE HER

	A giant spiral HYPNODISC WHIRRS, creating trippy black and white zig zag op-art
	effects a la Bridget Riley.

	She blinks.

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


166     SAME SCENE - LATER

	Steed is gone.  Dr. Darling leans over her.  Emma stares at the hypnodisc.  Closes her
	eyes.


167     EXTREME CLOSEUP ON HER EYES

	Thousand REMs per sec -- a tiny chip next to her eyes, transmitting out via wires to --


168     UP ON WALL

	A "Dreamscape" apparatus like a liquid TV screen flicks thru random images from
	Emma's unconscious.  Peter Peel -- Teddy Bears -- post card views -- childhood 
	snaps --


169     BESIDE "BED"

	Dr. Darling furls his hand over Emma's, his fingers resting upon her ring.  During the
	interrogation, he soothingly strokes her hand -- tries to remove the ring without
	arousing her suspicion.  Pulls gently on it.


170     UP IN GALLERY

	In his wheelchair, Mother sits beside Steed.

					MOTHER
			This man -- did you see him?

					STEED
			No. Her husband, she says. Alice
			tried to warn us. A trap. Tell
			Mother beware. Tell Father
			That's all.


171     BY COUCH

	Dr. Darling leans forward to interrogate Emma.


172     FROM HER POV

	He looks and sounds sinister.  From a corner of her eye, she sees -- a clip of keys
	hanging from his pocket.


173     BACK TO SCENE

					DR. DARLING
			I want you to say the first thing
			that comes into your head when I
			say these words. Do you
			understand ... ?
				(as she nods)
			Blue ...

					EMMA
			... bottle ...

					DR. DARLING
			Red ...

					EMMA
			... head ...

	
					DR.  DARLING
			White ...


					EMMA
			Knight ...

					DR. DARLING
			Black...

					EMMA
			... death ...

					DR. DARLING
			Love...

					EMMA
			... death ...

	Steed watching, listening ...

					DR. DARLING
			Flower ...

					EMMA
			... power ...

	The exchange speeds up.  Unknown to Dr. Darling, Emma picks his keys; unlocks her
	straps.

					DR. DARLING
			Nature ...

					EMMA
			... preserve...

					DR. DARLING
			Secret ...

					EMMA
			... love...

					DR. DARLING
			Hope...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Fear ...

					EMMA
			... love ...

					DR. DARLING
			Peter ...

	As Emma talks, the "Dreamscape" plucks images from her unconscious in trippy
	psychedelic rush:  faces -- colors -- patterns flash past.

					EMMA
			... Piper picked a peck of pickled 
			peppers how many pecks of pickled 
			peppers did Peter Peel -- ?


174     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	Quietly unclicks a lock.  She stops in mid-gabble.

					EMMA
			How long have I been here?

					DR. DARLING
			Three days.

	Emma unlocks her straps.  Sits Up.  Woozy.

					EMMA
			Do you get paid by the hour?

	Dr. Darling is shocked, indignant.  Emma rips wires from her body.  The "Dreamscape"
	machine winds down.  Up in the gallery --

	BAM -- !  Mother bashes his metal cane on the railings

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You are here under observation, 
			Mrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. 
			Darling's questions

	Pushes Dr. Darling aside.

					EMMA
			I resign.

					MOTHER
				(filtered)
			You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You
			can't resign.

					EMMA
			Watch me.

	Emma staggers.  Mother looks at Steed.  Who snaps himself out of staring at the
	hypnodisc.

	Emma heads for the airlock door marked:

	"ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER -- NO ADMITTANCE"

					MOTHER
			Don't open that, Mrs. Peel!

	Fat chance ... she goes in ...


175     INT.  ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER

	Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.  And float
	helplessly, turning around madly.  Trying to gain on Emma.  Mother's wheelchair,
	Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "OFF"
	switch

					EMMA
				(echoing)
			What are you trying to do to me?

					MOTHER
				(flailing)
			We want to help...!

					EMMA
			I thought I was a widow. My
			husband ... the only man I ever
			loved ... is dead. For the rest
			of my life I have to live with
			that.

					MOTHER
			The death of Peter Peel was a
			great loss. To us all ...

					EMMA
			To you ... ?

	Mother looks at Emma.  He's let the cat out the bag.  Steed finds the "OFF" switch.
	They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair,
	Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.  He moves to Mother --

					STEED
			I think you owe Mrs. Peel an
			explanation ...

	Steed stares Mother out.  Who delivers his revelations.

					MOTHER
			Peter Peel was a first class agent.
			A senior operative.
			'X' department Special operations.  
			He was engaged in top secret research.  
			Top priority.  Government approved.

					EMMA
			The Institute ... the funding ...

					MOTHER
			A cover ... for us.
				(beat)
			I'm sorry...

	A turning moment for Emma.  A life lived on a lie.

					EMMA
			So all that time. Our work, our research 
			was for you ... for this? And the 
			accident --

					DARLING
			It was no accident.

					EMMA
			The official investigation ...

					MOTHER
			... was written by me.
				(beat)
			It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.

	Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him.

					EMMA
			Who?

					MOTHER
			Quite frankly ... it could have
			been you.

	Silence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes

					STEED
			You're accusing Mrs. Peel of
			killing her own husband?

					MOTHER
			Her husband suspected someone very 
			close to the operation. On the day he 
			died, he was setting a test.
			To prove to himself -- to us that his 
			wife was beyond suspicion. He had to 
			be certain. He said he was going to 
			give Mrs. Peel something ...

	Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.

					MOTHER
			... I want you to remember. Did
			Peter give you anything on-that 
			day?


176     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	touches her ring.


177     BACK TO SCENE

	Emma looks up at Mother.  A barefaced lie.

					EMMA
			No.

	Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously.

					DR. DARLING
			He said if it vanished, he'd know
			it was ... you who betrayed him.
			He took a huge risk. The ultimate
			test.

					EMMA
			So I'm still ...

					MOTHER
			Under suspicion. Everyone died in 
			the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were 
			the only survivor ...

	Mother waits.  Emma turns round.  Looks fiercely at him.  Mother shifts uneasily as
	Emma walks past him to the airlock.

					MOTHER
			This is an official matter, Mrs.
			Peel. No need to take it
			personally. Where are you going?

					EMMA
			To find out who killed my husband.

					MOTHER
			The doors and walls are monitored, 
			Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure 
			establishment.

					EMMA
			So am I.

	Emma pushes open the doors.  Walks out.  Down a corridor.  Dr. Darling grabs
	Mother, as he exits with Steed --

					DR. DARLING
			She must remain here. She's
			highly dangerous.


178     IN HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going ...

					MOTHER
			Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs.
			Peel. Unfortunately --

					STEED
			Guilty until proven innocent?

					MOTHER
			Mother and Father know best.

	Mother wheels himself off.  Then stops; over his shoulder:

					MOTHER
			Something quick. Nothing too ...
			messy.

	ON Steed.  CAR ROAR over as --


179     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE CLINIC - DAY

	Emma drives a hot-wired Morris Minor out the open gates of the manor house, past a
	sign which reads:

	"WINSLOW HOME FOR RETIRED LEPIDOPTORISTS" (Butterfly logo)

	In the b.g., a couple of old-timers race around with butterfly nets as Steed's jag pulls
	past them in hot pursuit.


180     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	Emma speeds down lanes ...

	Followed at a safe distance by Steed in his SS100.


181     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Steed looks: a bleep on his radar screen tracks the --


182     CLOSEUP - CONCEALED MICRO-BUG - INTERCUT

	on Emma's shoulder as she drives ...


183     EXT.  LANES - DAY

	The cars whiz past ...


184     INT.  STEED'S JAG - DAY

	Keeping an eye on his radar and the road, Steed switches on the radio.  The weather
	forecast:

					RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			'... Sunny intervals leading to
			sudden storms and gale warnings
			for all areas.
				(as he frowns)
			... Outbursts of rain, scattered
			hailstorms and freezing fog
			greeted the World Council of
			Ministers as they arrived in
			London for their conference ...'

	Emma drives into a churchyard.  Steed follows her ...


185     INT.  COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY	

	A medieval country church.  Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma
	as Steed watches her lay --

	A red rose by an altar tomb:  an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of
	eternal sleep:  Peter Peel.

	Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.  Steed watches Emma move
	away, toward the door.  He drops a hymn book.  Emma swivels round -- sees Steed.

					EMMA
			You followed me.

					STEED
			Orders.

					EMMA
			To kill me?

					STEED
				(fractional pause)
			Nothing personal.

	Emma smiles. Then turns, and --

	Runs!  Steed follows Emma through a door to --


186     INT.  CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY

	Steed enters, glimpses --

	Emma above.  He follows her.  Hears her footsteps.  Trip- trapping up the spiral
	staircase.  Steed listens, follows.


187     UP BELLTOWER

	From below, Steed hears a BELL RING.  A FLUTTER of BIRDS.  As debris falls
	down -- Steed runs up stairs, reaches --


188     EXT.  BELLTOWER TOP - DAY

	BELL still RINGING.  At the top, a sheer drop.  Steed edges closer to the ledge. 
	Looks.  A long way down.
	From behind --

					EMMA
			A long way down.

	Steed swivels.  Sees Emma blocking his path.  Cool menace.  Steed steps away from
	the edge, Emma circles him.

					STEED
			Careful. You might fall.

	Emma steps to the edge.  Steed freezes.  Emma locks down.  Feet resting on the ledge. 
	Rocking to and fro ...

					EMMA
			I could save you the trouble.

					STEED
			No trouble.

					EMMA
			Because you always obey orders ...

					STEED
			Always.
				(pause)
			Except ...

	Steed nears her.  Emma pushes herself right to the edge.

					EMMA
			Yes ... ?

					STEED
			... when I don't. It comes down to one 
			thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.

	Steed reaches out for her.  Holds out his hand.

					EMMA
			And do you trust me?

					STEED
			I could be convinced, if ... I knew who 
			poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...

					EMMA
			It wasn't me; you have my word.

	Steed snatches her from the edge, holds her in his arms.

					STEED
			I need proof.

	Emma thinks.  Looks at him.  Deadly serious.  Their eyes lock.  She hesitates, then
	pecks him on the cheek.

					STEED
			It was longer. On the lips.

	Emma hesitates.  Then a kiss on the lips.  Longer.  But not much.  Steed grabs her
	hand, pulls her back.

					STEED
			Much longer.  Approximately ...
			fifteen seconds.

	Emma harumphs, exasperated.  Moves closer to him.

					EMMA
			... Ready?

	Steed nods.  Emma leans forward.  A full kiss.  At first reticent ... Emma looks at her
	watch.  Counts seconds ...

					EMMA
			... Four ... seven ... ni-...

	Then ... forgets.  Warmer, more relenting.  Edging towards passionate.  They stay
	embracing for fifteen seconds ...

					EMMA
				(aroused)
			Mmm ... what are you doing?

					STEED
			Keeping a stiff upper lip?

					EMMA
			Is that all?

	The kiss continues couple of seconds longer.  Before Emma withdraws.  With an effort,
	she regains her composure.  A long silence.

					EMMA
			So I'm in the clear?

	Steed savors the kiss.  No reply.  His smile says it all.

					EMMA
			But you did suspect me.

					STEED
			Not for a moment.

					EMMA
			You're playing games.

					STEED
			Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			I thought you played by the rules.

					STEED
			I thought you didn't.

					EMMA
			I'm playing to win.

					STEED
			Winning isn't everything.

					EMMA
			Please don't tell me it's how you
			play the game.

					STEED
				(smiles; stands
				aside)
			After you -- Mrs. Peel ...

	Steed motions down the stairs.  It's close to the edge.

					EMMA
			No, after you.

					STEED
				(back to square
				one)
			You don't trust me?

					EMMA
			As far as you trust me.

	Emma motions.  Steed goes down, passes close to the edge, and swivels round
	nervously.  Emma reads his thoughts.

					EMMA
			When it happens, Steed, you'll be
			the first to know ...

	With this comforting thought, Steed descends first.


189     EXT.  CHURCH TOWER - DAY

	As Steed and Emma exit from the tower, they see --

	A tranquil village scene.  Choirboys walk out from the church.  Nearby in the deserted
	village street.  A red PHONE BOX.  Which ...

	RING-RING ... Starts to RING.

					EMMA
			Who could that be?

	A ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed looks up: a clear sky.  He's puzzled.  Suddenly
	suspicious.  As Emma moves to the phone.

					STEED
			No -- don't answer it ...

	He pulls her back.  Emma looks at him.

					STEED
			That's it. The phones trigger
			the explosions --

	RING-RING ... Another ROLL of THUNDER.  Steed connects the two as -- an
	angelic CHOIRBOY walks towards the phone ...

	RING-RING ... A LOUDER ROLL of THUNDER.  As the Choirboy nears the
	PHONE, Steed shouts --

					STEED
		Don't -- don't answer it -- !


190     CLOSEUP - PHONE

	RING-RING -- the PHONE in the f.g. as the choirboy closes in, opens the door --


191     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The door shuts.  Noise muffled.  The Choirboy can't hear Steed and Emma's shouted
	warnings, as he lifts his hand up, and --


192     OUTSIDE

	Steed sees him reach out, warns the vicar and choirboys.

					STEED
			Get down -- get down -- it's
			going to explode -- !

	Steed and Emma, all the choirboys hit the dirt, as


193     INSIDE PHONE BOX

	The Choirboy grabs the phone, and lifts it up, and

	Silence.

	No explosion.  A few seconds pass.  Steed and everyone
	are down on the ground.  As they see --


194     FROM PHONE BOX	

	-- the Choirboy leaves the phone hanging.  He gets out, scans the crowd.  Then walks
	calmly over to Steed, who's still prone.

					CHOIRBOY
			It's your mother.

	The vicar and choirboys look on sympathetically, as --

	Steed dusts himself off.  Emma and everyone gets up.  Steed goes to the phone box,
	takes the call.

					STEED
			Mother? How did you find me?

	His expression changes as he listens.  Emma goes to the phone box as Steed rings off.
	He emerges from the box.

					STEED
			I told Mother I took care of you.

					EMMA
			You lied.

					STEED
			I equivocated. But you're not
			their big worry at present. It's
			Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...

	OFF Emma's reaction to this news --


195     INT.  HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY

	Inside the upper room, in front of a mirror --

	With his back turned to us.  Dr. Darling holds something in his hand, and waits as --


196     DOWN LONG HALL

	Bad "Emma" walks over.  She stands in front of him.

	Blank expression.  Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.  With her hair up, we recognize
	on her neck a tattoo:  Z424.

					DR. DARLING
			We are in the final phase. I shall require 
			you to be especially obedient. There 
			must be no failures.


197     CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER

	which he grips tightly. As --


198     IN MIRROR

	a metamorphosis.  His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's
	slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.  He adjusts it, then ...

	Shakes the snowshaker ...


199     EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

	THUNDER as the sky darkens -- PAN DOWN to reveal:

	Steed's Jag, zooming through country lanes.  Rain starts.


200     INT.  JAG - DAY

	Steed driving, winces with the drizzle.

					STEED
			Drat. Someone wants to implicate
			you in this affair, Mrs. Peel.
			Any idea who?

					EMMA
			No idea who. No idea why ...

					STEED
				(thinks)
			Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys
			All children's things ...

					EMMA
			... Or grown-ups, who still like
			to be children.

					STEED
			Quite. Any childhood friends?
			Enemies?

					EMMA
			Not to speak of. Peter and I
			were both loners. There was
			nobody.

	Steed thinks; sighs.

					STEED
			Very well. I have a friend who
			might be of assistance. He's at
			the Ministry. We'd better be
			careful.

					EMMA
			I'm a wanted woman, I know ...


201     INT.  MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY

	Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" --

	-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:  dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella
	and bowler.  Which is

	Emma Peel, in disguise.  Steed furtively checks passers-by.

					STEED
			His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.

					EMMA
			Why's he called 'Invisible'?

					STEED
			You'll find out.

	At a door marked "Information -- Col. I. Jones." Steed knocks, opens the door for her.

					EMMA
			Aren't you coming?

					STEED
			I'll catch you up. Don't worry;
			he's expecting you.

	Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor.


202     INT.  MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY

	A room full of archives and files.  Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets
	full of old paper.

	Dusty, musty and mildewing.  Long forgotten.  Nobody there.  Suddenly Emma 
	hears --

	FOOTSTEPS.

	She follows them.  Round stacks, round corners.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER. 
	She's closing in.  The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her --

	A filing cabinet drawer opens up.  On its own.

	Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.  The drawer slams shut.  Still
	nobody there.  Emma follows the file to a --

	Desk.  Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.  The file pages open up.  Then the
	phone lifts up by itself, a voice:

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
				(beat)
			Colonel Jones at your service,
			Mrs. Peel. Just a moment --

	Emma looks ahead of her.  To the chair. As --

	A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.  The pipe
	lights; smoke belches forth.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel.
			That usually helps. Don't worry
			about me being invisible. Other
			than that I'm perfectly normal.

					EMMA
			I see.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Or rather, you don't. Learnt the
			tricks in camouflage. Till this
			accident made a prang of things.
			How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?


203     INT.  MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE

	Steed on the phone.

					STEED
			I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ...
			Barometer's falling fast. Mrs.
			Peel and I find ourselves in
			need of foul weather gear.
				(beat)
			Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff
			for starters. And then --


204     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE

	File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are. Steed asked me
			to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.

					EMMA
			Peter's brother?  But --

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Half-brother to be precise.

	Emma is surprised.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... 
			research into robotics and plastics.  
			Overtaken by Peter's work on the 
			physics of climate change ...

					EMMA
			I know all this.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.) 
			Do you also know that during your 
			final experiment, your halfbrother-
			in-law was under surveillance?

					EMMA
			Surveillance? By whom?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Father. She gave him an 'all clear' 
			after a security test by Dr. Darling.

					EMMA
			Who's now vanished.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Makes two of us.

					EMMA
			Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling 
			and Valentine were somehow in this 
			together? But that's absurd.

	Steed enters behind them on the run --

					STEED
			We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Hurry?  What for?  I'm just
			now --

					STEED
			You didn't tell her?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(testy)
			I was getting to it.

					EMMA
			Getting to what?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The World Council of Ministers meets 
			tomorrow to convene the new global 
			defense initiative --

					EMMA
			I fail to see --

					STEED
			There's a reception this evening. Colonel 
			Jones thinks it advisable we attend.

					EMMA
			Have we been invited?

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
				(poker-voiced)
			Under the circumstances Mother didn't 
			see fit, but I think I can get you in ...

					EMMA
				(surveys her male
				outfit)
			Well, I can't possibly go like this.

					STEED
			I had a feeling. That's why we're 
			in a hurry ...

	Steed proffers an arm to Emma.

					STEED
			May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?

	She decides, takes his arm.

					EMMA
			You may, Mr. Steed.

	The A-team is born.  Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones.


205     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Troops rushing in to take up defense positions.  Searchlights pierce the cloudy sky.  A
	protective ring of hardware surrounds the hall.


206     INT.  MOTHER'S 22 BUS (AKA INSIDE MOBILE HQ) - NIGHT

	At the controls, Brenda looks on.  She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother.  Who
	picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in
	passenger seats --

	ORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --

					MOTHER
			Inside that hall are some of the
			Most powerful figures in the
			world. Tight security. Our
			only option.

					FATHER
			I'll see to it personally.

	Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --


207     EXT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Wind picking up.  Outside the grand palace hall for the reception of the World Council
	of Ministers, guards stand on duty.  Barriers, flashing lights.  Nobody gets past, 
	except --


208     INT.  PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT

	Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting. 
	He with bowler and umbrella.  She in black leather and boots.  They find themselves in
	a niche and freeze, very close to one another.  Steed sniff s ...

					STEED
			What's that you're wearing?

					EMMA
			It's called Black Leather.

					STEED
			Intoxicating. Here, have one of
			these.

	He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket

					EMMA
			What is it?

					STEED
			Limpet bomb. Small, very
			compact. From Trubshaw's.

					EMMA
				(hocks it on
				belt)
			When all this is over, we simply
			must get you out of that suit.

					STEED
			You first.

					EMMA
			Shall we?

	She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet carpets, glittering
	chandeliers.  From the hall, a SPEECH ECHOES:

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			... In the uncertain climate that threatens 
			this global initiative, no magic umbrella 
			can shield us.

	Steed checks out his own.

					MINISTER (V.O.)
			Only our own vigilance. Security and 
			stability are our watchwords.

	APPLAUSE.

	Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.  Inside...

					EMMA
			Trubshaw again? What now?

					STEED
			Snuff.
				(off Emma's lock)
			I must insist you try some.

	Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.  Weird.  Does it make you high?  They
	walk on, open doors to --


209     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	An empty gallery.  Steed and Emma peer down at a --


210     MARBLE HALLWAY

	A black and white floor.  Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.  Otherwise,
	empty.  A chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through
	empty halls.

					STEED
			They're playing your song, Mrs.
			Peel.

					EMMA
				(annoyed)
			'The Merry Widow?' I might have
			known. Where's the reception?

	They move cautiously forward as


211     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	Outside, snow begins to fall.  Trees and buildings shimmer under a light layer of white. 
	A Christmassy glow --

	Even troops play with snowflakes, until --


212     SEVERAL ANGLES

	The wind rises.  The snow falls harder.


213     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.  They head down a 
	corridor, then hear a NOISE.  They hide behind pillers. As --

	Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats. 
	Steed steals --

	A chicken leg.  Nibbles on it.  Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.  Steed
	looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him.

					STEED
			Oh, hello ...

					FATHER
			We want Mrs. Peel.

					STEED
			Dead, I'm afraid.

	Emma in hiding, listens as --

					FATHER (O.S.)
			You disobeyed an order, Steed.  
			Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot 
			be trusted.

	Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --

					STEED (O.S.)
			I think she can.
				(beat)
			Can you?

	Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice.

	Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone.

					FATHER
			I shall summon security.

	She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.

	Emma returns as the ALARM is raised --

					STEED
			Bad news. Father's looking for you.  
			Where are those bloody ministers?

					EMMA
			Have a look at this.

	She leads him to the window:  sure enough -- heavy snow.
	Steed reacts, eyes wide.

					STEED
			It's almost May, for heaven sake.


214     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - NIGHT

	The blizzard rages through streets --

	Now impassable.  Snow drifts block roads.  White mountains of snow start to climb up
	shop fronts.  And amid the sky --

	Filled with snowflakes, up round the roofs, a purple cloud descends on unsuspecting
	troops --


215     INT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls --

	To Emma. But up ahead, sees --


216     STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS

	A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as --


217     INT.  PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT

	Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls,
	ceiling murals --

	The World Council ministers assemble:  slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese
	Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by --

	Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a web of
	diplomatic protocol, interrupted by --


218     CENTER OF HALL

	The sight of Emma Peel in black leather.

	She strides into the room.  Picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler.  All stare,
	Emma raises her glass --

					EMMA
			Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach 
			of protocol. An emergency --

	From the hallway -- BOOM -- !  The door bursts open, Emma is blown over by the
	blast as the purple cloud races inside.


219     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall.

	From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff --

					STEED
			Quick --it'll protect you --

	Emma inhales.  Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear -- CRASH -- !  They
	see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, wearing a gas mask,
	leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- heads like black flies -- in formation
	round the ministers, helpless on the floor.  A kidnapping --

	The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --

	Escape from the rear doors.  The butlers form a guard to protect the man.

	Steed and Emma run after them.  More butlers pursue.


220     EXT.  PALACE - NIGHT

	As troops roll helplessly in the snow-covered purple haze, the butlers load the ministers
	onto waiting choppers as --


221     INT.  MOTHER'S HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION	

	Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...


222     INT.  PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as --

	Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls.  A butler passes them without noticing.  They try
	to emerge.  But another patrols --

	Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground.  He rises
	but Emma kicks him into as --

	Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse
	of butlers.  He shouts --

					STEED
			After him, Mrs. Peel!

	A whole posse of butlers then advances.  Steed faces them.

					STEED
			Go -- !

	Emma hesitates.  Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator.  She bangs the
	button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from MACHINE-GUNNING gas
	masked butlers strike the brass door as --

	Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers.  To give Emma
	time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to --

	Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as --


223     EXT.  ELEVATOR (UPPER FLOORS) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The posse of butlers fan out on to keep pace with Emma.  They head upstairs, pressing
	elevator "CALL" buttons on every floor, as --


224     INSIDE ELEVATOR	

	Emma waits inside.  Until she reaches --


225     EXT.  ELEVATOR (2ND FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Doors open.  A HAIL of BULLETS hit the lift as Emma hides to one side until the
	doors close.


226     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Emma sighs with relief.  COOL HUM as the ELEVATOR rises.


227     ON STAIRS - MEANWHILE

	Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as --

228     INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	At the next floor, the doors open --

	Two butlers rush inside.  BLAM -- !  Emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow
	punch,  then --

	Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to
	grab Emma by the throat.

	She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson hold on his
	arms and throat --

	And a knee in his back in time for --

	PING!  The BELL RINGS at --

	3rd floor where --

	Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face --

	Whooomph!  a blast of fire from --

	A flamethrower launched in the hall.

	Aaargh -- !  The butler gets fried, but --


229     EXT.  ELEVATOR (3RD FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Shields Emma from the worst of the blast. She  hurls him clear of the doors, which --


230     INT.  ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION

	Slam shut.  COOL HUM ...


231     EXT.  PALACE MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed continues his one-sided duel with the other butlers, skewering madly, trying to
	get upstairs to help Emma...


232     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Up Emma goes.  Looks for an escape route.  Bangs on the walls.  No trap doors.  No
	secret panels.  The "floor" light flickers between floors.

	Waiting, until ...


233     EXT.  ELEVATOR (4TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The doors open.  A grenade is hurled inside the doors, it rolls to one corner, Emma
	dives to the other side, then --

	Scrambles for the grenade.  Picks it up.  It slips out of her hands.  Scrambles more.  It
	slips out ...

	Just beyond the elevator doors.  Which start to shut.  Emma leans out a foot, kicks the
	grenade towards the butlers, and --

	As her elevator doors close --

	BOOM -- !  It EXPLODES among the butlers, one of whom --

	Rushes to --


234     ELEVATOR (5TH FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Where he waits for the elevator.  Removes pin.  Grenade ready.  The light PINGS.
	Doors open.  About to throw it inside, when --


235     BUTLER'S POV

	No Emma.


236     BACK TO SCENE

	The butler hesitates.  Looks inside.  Still no Emma?  He wonders what to do, and --

	The doors shut; he jams his foot.  The doors open again.  He moves in --


237     INT.  ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	-- and looks round.  Nobody there.  Until, as we --

	PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator
	roof, limbs flexed against the walls is --

	Emma, who -- drops down and --

	Scissors the butler's head between her legs.

	The grenade rolls free ...

	Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and --

	Sits on his face.  Buries his head in her crotch.  A muffled sound from the guy, until --

	Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.  She drags --


238     EXT.  ELEVATOR (67H FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	His head out.  Leaving his neck between the doors.  So as she leaps out, heads up for
	the stairs, the elevators doors.

	SLAM! And -- BOOM!  His GRENADE rocks the elevator, which


239     INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Breaks from its ropes, and --

	Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes --


240     INT.  PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by
	step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles...


241     INT.  PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT

	Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which --

	Flips open.  The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the
	skylight.  As the grenade --


242     INT.  NARROW STAIRCASE

	BOOM!  explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.  Emma rushes
	thru smoke, choking.  She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked.

	A moment's panic.  Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips
	the skylight up, and --

	Emerges into the night air.  Snowflakes tumble around her.


243     EXT.  ROOFTOP - HELIPAD - NIGHT

	Blades whirling.  Amid the blizzard, the man ready to escape in a super-fab streamlined
	whirly chopper ...

	Another assassin attacks Emma, pins her on her back, overlooking the city.  Stands up
	before her --

	Emma held back over gargoyle, over now snow white city ...  Knees assassin in balls.
	Flicks him backwards ...

	As his body hurtles down into the snow-covered streets, Emma rushes forward.  
	But too late:  sees --

	The chopper -- about to take off.


244     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	The gas-masked MAN in the white lab coat:

					MAN
			Goodbye, Mrs. Peel!


245     EXT.  ROOFTOP

	The chopper rises slowly.

	Emma looks.  A fifteen foot leap ... Impossible.


246     FROM INSIDE CHOPPER

	A farewell wave from the gas-masked man.


247     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	contemplating the jump, beneath falling snowflakes, as the distance grows.


248     EMMA'S POV

	The rope/chain ladder coils into the chopper's belly.


249     INT.  CHOPPER - NIGHT

	Above London rooftops, after dark --

	The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, CO-PILOT and a Butler (ditto).  From the
	chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command module.  A fairy tale, snow white
	city.

	OVER the RADIO, interference.  A changing of stations.  Then a CRACKLY
	broadcast of "The Merry Widow."

	As the WALTZ serenades them high above the city  -- 
	a KNOCKING from outside on the door --

	Surprised reactions.  The Butler opens the door, sees --

	Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts.  The Butler is too dumbstruck to say
	anything.

					EMMA
				(shouts, re:  the
				gas mask)
			Anyone ever tell you you look
			like a housefly?

	Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out --

	The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air.  Emma watches him fall ...

					EMMA
			Anyone else need a lift?

	The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, still
	clinging ...

					MAN
				(to Pilot; intercom)
			Can't you throw her off?

	The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as --

	Blam -- !  a kinky leather boot crashes --

	Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the GLASS from the front of the chopper,
	SMASHES so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air --

	The INSTRUMENT PANELS WHIRR round as the Pilots struggle for control --

					VOICE (V.O.)
				(intercom)
			Where'd she go?


250     EXT.  CHOPPER TOP - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	with the blades whirling directly over her head, Emma crawls over the top of the
	chopper and lets herself down the other side as London's lights twinkle beneath ...

	As the Co-Pilot pokes his head out of the cockpit --

	Emma grabs him with one hand, hoists him up into the air --

	The Co-Pilot dangles over the city.  Grabs Emma.  Slithers back onto the cockpit.
	Pistol whips her.  Emma crunches back onto the metal.  Blades whirring close!  
	The co-Pilot peers into her eyes from inside the gas mask --

					CO-PILOT
			Happy landings, Mrs. Peel.

	He raises his hand, ready to hit her again, Emma yanks him up, where his head get
	sliced off by the blades -- body and head fall away separately ...

	As Emma reacts, her legs are grabbed from below and the white-coated Man pulls her
	down the side of the chopper --

	Emma falls, but manages a flying handhold, hangs onto the chain wire below the
	chopper.  As --


251     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT

	The Pilot and his passenger zoom at low level over buildings.  Trying to dislodge
	Emma ...


252     THEIR POV

	Thru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up topped in
	snow, feet up ... shinnying up the chain wire ...

	"THE MERRY WIDOW WALTZ," no longer heard as old record or ensemble
	arrangement but enormous, for FULL ORCHESTRA ...


253     CLOSEUP - EMMA

	grimly hoists herself up along the struts again, hand over hand, coming up to the
	cockpit from behind --


254     BACK TO SCENE

	With a sudden movement, she yanks the Pilot out from behind and he goes flying
	towards eternity on his own.

	The chopper out of control as the white-coated Man is left to fly it himself ...


255     IN NIGHT AIR

	"THE MERRY WIDOW" BOOMS, the chopper lurches, spinning round -- up and
	down, over spiraling corkscrews, an insane waltz ...


256     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The white-coated Man gets control ...


257     EXT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Zig-zags down a narrow street, trying to smash Emma into sides of windows.


258     SEVERAL ANGLES

	as Emma bounces of buildings, holding on for dear life ...


259     EXT.  WIDE ANGLE OVER THAMES - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The chopper dips down, dragging Emma through icy water ...

	Up ahead ... Tower Bridge ... twin peaks ... a firework display going on ... rockets and
	lights in the sky thru snowflakes ...

	Emma sees the bridge coming, reaches down and --


260     CLOSEUP SHOT

	Detaches her pocket limpet bomb and lobs it into the chopper cockpit.


261     HER POV

	The bridge looms up, chopper rising to cross it as Emma leaps onto the bridge!


262     INT.  CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The Man sees the bomb ...

	Also flings himself onto the bridge as --

	Against b.g. of the fireworks display --


263     WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.  Ball of flames.  The crowd roars in
	appreciation ... great fireworks!


264     EXT.  TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	Emma picks herself up, sees the Man in the white lab coat and runs for him.

	He runs too -- towards --


265     ANOTHER CHOPPER

	which unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... 
	The Man reaches for the dangling ladder --
	but --


266     CLOSEUP - ON HIS FOOT

	stuck, wedged between narrow battlements.


267     BACK TO SCENE

	The Man looks at his shoe, at Emma charging towards him, at the rope ladder.  He
	pulls his foot out of his shoe and grabs the ladder, sailing off in the second chopper,
	leaving Emma panting behind.  She's soaked, frozen, gasping for breath, bending over,
	when she sees --


268     CLOSEUP - SHOE

	Emma pulls it from its wedge, looks at the inside:  --  "Trubshaw's of Jermyn Street."

					STEED (V.O.)
			I thought it was Cinderella
			who lost her slipper ...


269     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN

	On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.  BLARING SIRENS.  Searchlights.  PA
	announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a
	CLOCK TICKS calmly.  Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes. 
	Steed & Trubshaw beside her.

					EMMA
			This time the shoe's on the other
			foot. You said a hand-made shoe
			was as good as a photo-fit or
			D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is
			find the shoe that fits ...

					TRUBSHAW
			It should be easy. A Trubshaw
			client has his shoes delivered
			personally. The Ministry should
			be able to confirm our delivery.

					STEED
			I'll be back ...

					EMMA
			Where are you going?

					STEED
			Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather 
			may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...

					EMMA
			You needn't bother. I can't drag you 
			further into this. After all, I am still 
			the chief suspect.

					STEED
			No bother. Mother and Father think
			I've joined you. I might as well.

					EMMA
			But --

					STEED
				(comes back)
			Oh, and by the way, I think it's about 
			time you got rid of that chip on your 
			shoulder.

					EMMA
			If you'd been through what I have,
			you wouldn't --

	Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder.

					STEED
			A microtag. One of Mother's little
			toys. There you are. Free at last.

	He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.


270     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	An armory.  Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords --
	ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ...

	Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ...


271     UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER

	Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.  Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe
	lasts.

					EMMA
			Prince Charming, I presume.
			Your name is ...


272     CLOSE ON WORN PAPER LABEL

	with the name:  DARLING.

					EMMA
			Oh my God ...


273     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed selects his umbrella and we FOLLOW UP TO:


274     INT.  TRUBSHAW'S - UPSTAIRS - DAY

	He sees only Trubshaw.

					STEED
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					TRUBSHAW
			She just left, sir. In a hurry.

					STEED
			What?

					TRUBSHAW
			She said you'd understand.


275     ON STEED

	Worried.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Ah, here we are ...


276     CLOSEUP - PIP PUFFING IN MID-AIR

	WIDEN to reveal:


277     INT.  MINISTRY ARCHIVES - DAY

	Inside the archives, among leather volumes.  A file goes through the air, passed to
	Emma ... As she reads.  A map is opened across a desk from her.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			'X' marks the spot. The shoes were 
			delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
			Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the 
			site of a former Ministry installation...

					EMMA
			... and now?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Privately owned by ...

					EMMA
			Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Very good, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			I shall need a small plane.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			You're not venturing alone, surely.

					EMMA
			I'm going to find out who killed
			my husband. Will you take these
			documents to Steed?


					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			Of course.


278     ON EMMA

					EMMA
			Tell him I said ... goodbye.


279     INT.  SECRET SERVICE HQ - DAY

	below the Thames as at the beginning.

	In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth.  Controls around him
	flash emergency.  Panic.  Cakes piled up beside him, uneaten.  Beside him, Father.
	Brenda hands a phone.


					BRENDA
			Steed for you.

	Mother grabs the phone, furious.

					MOTHER
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

	He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits
there.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I was hoping you could tell me.

					MOTHER
			You're getting yourself into terrible 
			trouble, my son. Weather's turning 
			very nasty -- and so am I.

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			I'm going to follow up on a hunch of 
			my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is 
			innocent and you have a mole.

					MOTHER
				(grabs mirror;
				searches his face)
			Where?

					STEED (V.O.)
				(filtered)
			In your operation.

					MOTHER
			I'm warning you for the last time, 
			Steed: whoever's behind all this, 
			looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like 
			Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.

	CLICK.  The line goes dead.


280     CLOSE ON MOTHER

	Furious.

					MOTHER
			Steed??
				(to Father)
			Find Mrs. Peel.

	Brenda smiles at the thought.  Father rises, grim.


281     EXT.  SKY - DAY

	Through mist, an ultralight plane zooms down -- From the plane, Emma leaps in
	parachute ...  Down, down, down through the mist ...

	Over parkland, the parachute floats down ... To an island in the middle of the
	Serpentine river.


282     EXT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - DAY

	Emma lands, buries her parachute.  Walks towards a thick jungle, then a stream.  Emma
	hops across on water lilies until she reaches land again.  Where a peacock fans its tail of
	a thousand eyes.  A CLICK of CAMERAS.

	In the midst of the jungle, Emma sees --


283     HER POV

	A red phone box.  Emma frowns in recognition; goes inside.  Picks up the phone.
	Presses "Button B", and --

	The floor goes down.  Emma goes down with it, into --


284     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND HQ

	Formerly a Ministry installation.  The "elevator" stops.  Remembering, as from a dream,
	Emma steps out into --


285     LONG DARK CORRIDOR

	A GUARD patrols.  Emma pushes herself against a wall.  The wall gives way to flip
	round, and Emma swivels into --


286     INT.  TOTALLY DARK CHAMBER

	The door locks behind.  Alone, Emma stands warily.

	From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice.  Intimate.  Seductive.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have 
			been a worthy opponent. You have 
			tracked us down. You are within an 
			ace of winning.

					EMMA
			This isn't a game.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Quite right, but we still make the rules.

					EMMA
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			People, too.

					EMMA
			Then who wins?

					VOICE
			You and I. Together. But first you 
			must confront your greatest enemy.
			Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?  
			The answer is obvious ...

	Suddenly lights!

	Emma is in a hall of mirrors.

					VOICE (V.O.)
			Yourself.

	In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her,
	splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and confused by the multiple images.

	Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the
	lips.

	Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls her mouth
	away, staggers back; realizes too late.  The hallucinogenic lip poison.  Emma crumples
	to her knees as --


287     EMMA'S POV

	Sees "herself" above her, before she -- falls unconscious.


288     EXT.  COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

	Steed's Jag races, skids in bad weather.


289     INT.  CAR

	Behind the wheel Steed, his face grim, concentrates on the slippery road.  On the seat
	next to him the snow shaker with little Emma inside --

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


290     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	As if in a dream, Emma awakes captive inside a bizarre cage:  A life size snow shaker.
	Emma "swims" in viscous air,	suspended like a mermaid.  Thru glass she sees --

	A face peering in:  Father.

					FATHER
				(filtered)
			Emma in Wonderland. Welcome,
			Mrs. Peel.
				(filtered)
			We've been expecting you. We hope 
			you'll enjoy your stay with us. 
			Decontamination is almost complete.

					EMMA
			Decontamination -- ?

					FATHER
			And you've a new wardrobe. He
			does want you to look attractive.
				(beat )
			He tells me you're very beautiful.

	Emma pounds the glass in frustration.

					FATHER
			Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds
			of feet below ground. The Ministry
			made it impregnable. No one can
			save you.


291     EXT.  SPIRES OF ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	as Steed drives towards it ...


292     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - DINING ROOM

	Bathed in candlelight.  A romantic supper for two ...

	A door opens, admitting -- Emma. Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous.  She locks
	around, sees another door.  In search of escape she hastens to open it, only to reveal --

	A giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting.

	Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, removing the 
	head -- it's Dr. Darling!!!


					DR. DARLING
			Emma, my dear. How lovely you
			look.

	He steps out of the rest of his costume ...

					EMMA
			Would that I could say the Same.

					DR. DARLING
			Ah, but you haven't see the real
			me. Watch closely ...

	He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her --

	Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as --

	Dr. Darling turns into ... Peter!

					EMMA
			Peter ...

					PETER
			Darling Emma --

					EMMA
			It was you ... all the time?

					PETER
			Not really. Not quite. I'm
			afraid you still don't see ...

	Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting ...

	Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head.

	It's Valentine!

					TEACHER (V.O.)
			Valentine Peel ...


293     EXT.  ETON COLLEGE - EVENING

	beneath Gothic turrets pupils in top hats and tails.

					OLD TEACHER (V.O.)
			Yes, I remember him quite well ...

	PULL BACK THROUGH windows to reveal:  Steed and an OLD TEACHER in the
	beautiful library.

					OLD TEACHER
			This is where he used to spend his
			days. We have an old photograph
			somewhere ...

	He's flipping through yearbooks, then shows Steed --


294     CLOSEUP - PHOTO

	of Valentine Peel on stage, in wizard's garb.  Made up as an old man ...


295     BACK TO SCENE

					TEACHER
			Absolute wizard with makeup. His
			favorite roll from Shakespeare.
			Prospero ...

					STEED
			'The Prospero Project...'

					TEACHER
			... From The Tempest. A banished
			duke, ousted by his brother,
			marooned on a magic island. Who
			controlled the weather.


296     CLOSEUP - STEED

	grim.

					STEED
			'O Brave New World that hath
			such people in it.'


297     BACK TO DINNER TABLE

	Emma frozen, sinks into a chair, staring ...

					EMMA
			You.

					VALENTINE
			Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true 
			genius behind the Prospero Project ...

	He walks around the dinner table as he talks ...

					EMMA
			But you died -- in the explosion ...


298     FLASHBACK - CLOSE ON HAND IN WHITE GLOVE

	Twisting the dial.  PAN UP the arm to reveal Valentine.

					VALENTINE (V.O.)
			Oh, no. I arranged the explosion.


299     BACK TO PRESENT

					VALENTINE
			A slight miscalculation -- my face 
			was burned beyond recognition.
			Fortunately my research into plastics 
			came in handy ...

					EMMA
				(stunned)
			Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...

					VALENTINE
			An unholy trinity ...

					EMMA
				(stands)
			You killed my husband.

					VALENTINE
			For starters. Of course I had to kill 
			the Teddy Bears, as well ...

					EMMA
			Too many cooks --

					VALENTINE
			Spoil the majority shareholders. In 
			Wonderland Weather. I planned 
			everything, even the Ministry 
			recruiting you ...

					EMMA
			But I found you. All the clues
			led me here ...

					VALENTINE
			Of course. I planned that, too.

					EMMA
			But -- why?

					VALENTINE
			You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't
			you guess?
				(moves toward her)
			For you. It was all for you ...

					EMMA
				(cold)
			'Our revels now are ended.'

					VALENTINE
			Oh, no, Emma. They've only
			just begun ...


300     INT.  INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE - NIGHT

	The phone hangs in the air -- with the smoking pipe.

					INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
			The shoes were delivered to an island 
			in the Serpentine - former Ministry 
			installation ... she said to tell you 
goodbye. What?


301     CLOSEUP - STEED IN RED PHONEBOX (SOMEWHERE) - NIGHT

					STEED
			I said it's not goodbye yet.
			Listen, I'm going to need some
			help. In a hurry ...


302     INT.  HYDE PARK UNDERGROUND - DINING ROOM

					VALENTINE
				(indicates supper)
			Think of this as your second
			wedding feast ...

					EMMA
			I'm already married ...

					VALENTINE
			Come, come, you're a widow -- a
			most attractive widow. Now I think 
			of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.

	He pushes a button.  Bad Emma enters.  Tattooed Z424.  Unmistakably hostile.

					VALENTINE
			My latest model. A compound of 
			plastics and sensor chips. A big 
			improvement on the old X404s.
			The poor thing is quite fond of me. 
			Emma, say hello to Emma.

	BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK.

					VALENTINE 
			You know, I believe she's actually 
			jealous.

					EMMA
			Valentine, listen to me ...

					VALENTINE
			Right, bridesmaid. Now what
			have I left out? Oh, yes, I know:
			the ring.

					EMMA
				(covers her hand)
			Ring?

	He stands very near her -- she's terrified -- then:

					VALENTINE
			How silly of me -- let me make
			you comfortable first ...

	As he advances, ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSEUP Emma's eye

									
		DISSOLVE TO:


303     INT.  ISLAND (HYDE PARK) - NIGHT

	Another ball, WIDEN to reveal, from the lake, an odd eight foot high plastic ball
	emerges -- The ball lands on the shore.  From the inside, a zip peels away the plastic
	layer to reveal --

	Steed, like an urban dandy in suit and bowler.  A rose in his lapel.  He steps out, and,
	poking with his umbrella --

	Deflates the inflatable plastic submarine.  Steed heads off -- CAMERA EYES the
	peacock swivel towards him, as he heads into the jungle where he sees the --


304     RED PHONEBOX

	Steed picks up the phone.  Presses all the buttons until he hits "Button B."  As the floor
	lowers, his eyes widen in surprise ...



305     SARCOPHAGUS

	carved in Emma's likeness.  Lowered from the ceiling hydraulically into --


306     INT.  VALENTINE'S HIGH-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	as Valentine descends spiral steps to join it.

	Valentine opens the coffin to reveal Emma strapped within.

					VALENTINE
			That's better. I say, isn't this 
			where you came in? It's
			impenetrable, by the way ...

					EMMA
			You're mad.

					VALENTINE
			Entirely. On the other hand
				(he advances towards
				her, smiling)
			Mad people get things done. Let
			me show you --


307     INT.  UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed stealing down a corridor and --

	hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras.  He waits till
	they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and --

	Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.  Brings her down.

					FATHER
			Steed

					STEED
			How did you guess?

					FATHER
			You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black
			Leather ...

					STEED
			It was you who gave Valentine
			Peel his security clearance ...
			you're the mole who betrayed
			the Ministry.


					FATHER
			Mother betrayed me. She was 
			going to replace me with a younger 
			Father.  Errand boy that's all I was.  
			'Find Steed...'

					STEED
			Well, you found me. Have a sniff of 
			this, why don't you? Careful, the 
			scent can be overpowering ...

	Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the
	rubber tube, sprays a Mist.  Father passes out.  Steed rises, locks around.
	Sees --

	A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return.  He turns 
	and --


308     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing --
	until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S.

	Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see --


309     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER

	Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as
	Valentine explains.

					VALENTINE
			People expect weather to be free. 
			They're used to it. I call that a 
			denial of freedom. No freedom of 
			choice. An abuse of human rights. 
			They buy water, electricity, gas. 
			Why shouldn't they be able to buy 
			their own weather if they want to? 
			If they have a little incentive ...

	Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.

					EMMA
			Such as?

					VALENTINE
			Destruction of their local weather 
			systems. I can zap a thousand 
			Chernobyls into the air.

					EMMA
			The result would be ...

					VALENTINE
			Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop 
			failure.  Economic disaster.  
			Frostbite or sunburn ... on a 
			massive scale. 
			You've seen a few samples...

					EMMA
			Then what's stopping you?

					VALENTINE
			One very small thing. A diamond
			'cyclone' chip. A thousand times
			more information on a fraction of
			the size. If I possess that, my
			powers would be unlimited. My
			dear half-brother was developing
			it. But he suspected sabotage.
			He gave the chip to ... you,
			'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But
			also your ring.

	Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --


310     CLOSEUP - HER RING

A diamond.  In the light, a patterned imprint.  ZOOM IN -- a complex fractal equation of circuits.


311     BACK TO SCENE

					VALENTINE
			The missing piece of the jigsaw.
			I tried to get you to give it to me 
			as Peter; I tried to steal it from 
			you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll 
			be a bit less subtle.
				(he slips it off her
				finger; holds it up)
			With this ring my plan will be
			complete.

					EMMA
			How Wagnerian ... Do you mean 
			to say you've waited all these 
			years because you couldn't create 
			a chip on your own? That would 
			have amused Peter.

					VALENTINE
			Speaking of Peter, there's more good 
			news: You won't even have to change 
			your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			What are my choices?

					VALENTINE
			Choices?

					EMMA
			I'll never marry you.

	Valentine is philosophical.  He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma 
	lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --

					VALENTINE
			One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you 
			alive, darling Emma. In a year or five, 
			you may change your mind. If you're 
			still in it.

	Valentine presses a button.  From the ceiling -- a surgical laser.  Moves down to within
	inches of her face.

					VALENTINE
			This little toy gave me back my face.
			It can replace yours. What do you think?
			Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
			Thatcher?

	He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face.

	An ALARM BELL RINGS.  Emma reacts.

					FATHER (V.O.)
			Dr. Darling, this is Father. We
			have an intruder. I repeat --

	Valentine switches off the PA.

					VALENTINE
			Ah. That will be Steed. He followed 
			you. Please excuse me. I have work 
			to do. My most spectacular 
			performance. A ballet of clouds. It 
			was made for you. I want to give you 
			a heart, Emma. I want all of London 
			to see it. And now with this ...
				(flourishes ring)
			They will.
				(leans close)
			And for an encore: the biggest cyclone 
			in history will wipe the City from the 
			face of the earth.
				(winks)
			Shape of things to come, my darling.

	He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests. 
	Darkness.

	Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille.  No such luck.

					STEED
			Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!

	He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in
	that thing, anyway.

	He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.


312     EXT.  SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT

	Moonlight night.  Dark clouds approach like an army, spreading shadows.


313     INSIDE CLOUDS

	MOISTURE SPITS and CRACKLES, static energy waiting to explode ...

	In the sky -- clouds join together like a genie from a lamp, forming -- over the city -- a
	strange dark sensuous figure, half human, half dreamlike.

	That stalks the city....


314     INT.  DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed crawling.  A rat runs over him ...

					STEED
			The things I do for England ...

	Pitch dark, then --

	Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.

	Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo
	the gag.  Bad Emma removes it, she --

	Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh.
	Blood.  Her flesh.  Her blood.  Fascinated.

					EMMA
			You must let me go ...

	Bad Emma listens.  Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to --
	the HEARTBEAT.  Ba-boom.  Ba-boom ...

					EMMA
			Don't you understand? If he has
			me, he'll have no use for you ...
			he'll destroy you ...

	The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission.  She goes to the laser, aims
	it at Emma's face!

					EMMA
			No...

	Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --


315     ANOTHER PART OF UNDERGROUND H.Q.

	The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him --

					STEED
			Oh, dear.

	No escape.  He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at
	the guards, and --

	Hurls it ...


316     CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)

	A glinting razor's edge, which --

	Swoosh -- !  Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed.
	He taps twice hard steel as ...


317     OTHER GUARDS

	run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a
	sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !  One drops -- Bam -- !  The other collapses, slump
	to the ground.  Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --

	A dent in its steel top.  For the first time, Steed loses his cool.  Genuine rage.

					STEED
			Someone's going to pay for this.

	Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --


318     CLOSEUP - VALENTINE

	places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ...

	WIDEN to reveal ...


319     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	Masses of dials and switches.  ( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... )

	Valentine hits a switch ...

					VALENTINE
			Start the countdown. Action
			stations. Five minutes ...

	The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards --

	Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts.
	A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.  The CLOCK TICKS.

	Father enters behind him.

					FATHER
			Congratulations. The clouds are
			on course ...

					VALENTINE
			To explode. London will be ashes.

					FATHER
			Not yet! They haven't heard our
			terms ... !

	Father tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off.

					VALENTINE
			Are you insane? Stop the program
			and you activate the auto-destruct!

					FATHER
			But all those people -- !

	Valentine strikes her hard --

					VALENTINE
			My cloud ballet! My cyclone!

	Father slides to the floor.  Valentine ignores her.  Concentrates on the control panel red
	lights, as --


320     EXT.  PARLIAMENT SQUARE - NIGHT

	Up in the sky, more white clouds --

	Darken into boiling black.  They move and billow.  Bubbling with gases and energy
	Swirling with motion, a life of their own.

	FROM river, a scarlet fog floats upwards.  It gains mass and weight, slowly forming as
	it rolls --


321     THROUGH CITY STREETS

	then RISES ABOVE them -- into a weird pulsating red shape.
	A love heart.


322     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL READOUTS

	Whirling backwards ...


323     INT.  MOTHER'S UNDERWATER HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Mother at the controls.  RINGS the ALARM.  Panic stations as -- SIRENS BLARE. 
	WARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --

					MOTHER
			Dense cloud formation moving south-
			west. On course for the center of the 
			city. A fog floating in from the river. 
			The prediction is ... unstable chemical 
			reaction. Enforce the curfew ... 
			Emergency stand by ... !


324     EXT.  SKY OVER BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

	Bad storm clouds advance over London ... black and furious.


325     OVER CITY - SEVERAL ANGLES

	As shadows in a whirl of chemical matter.  An airborne CYCLONE of BELCHING
	static ELECTRICITY.  The black shape now --

	Forming a sensuous female shape.  Like a dream wisp of ...

	Emma Peel with an hourglass figure.  While --


326     FROM RIVER

	The heart-shaped cloud seems to -- move towards the black genie shape -- trying to
	connect, to form the cyclone ...


327     EXT.  LONDON STREETS - SEVERAL ANGLES - NIGHT

	Action stations.  AIR RAID SIRENS ...

	Like a re-run Blitz.  Streets now eerily empty and dark.
	Through deserted streets --

	Troops race to positions in gas masks.  Searchlights illuminate clouds.  Worried faces
	watch the skies, as --


328     CLOSEUP - DIGITAL NUMBERS

	Fly ...


329     INT.  HI-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - DAY

	Chaos on all TV monitors as ...

	Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin.  What will he find??
	Emma's there, still gagged.  Looks asleep.

					VALENTINE
			My dear.
				(pulls the gag:
				kisses her)
			I wouldn't want you to miss the
			grand finale ...

	Emma opens her eyes.  Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale sign:  Z424. 
	Bad Emma is unmistakable.  He strikes her -- yanks her out of the coffin.

					VALENTINE
			Find her. Kill her ...

	He races back upstairs as ...


330     INT.  UNDERGROUND HYDE PARK - HQ CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS
	ACTION

	Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling
	high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.  She hears NOISE IN the
	DISTANCE.  Suddenly --


331     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed battles more guards!  No time to lose.

	Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers,
	closing in on --


332     INT.  UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.  Pounding on door.

	He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how
	to stop the program.

	Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in
water.


333     FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH

	opens behind.  Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.  Steed
	whirls.

					VALENTINE
			John Steed.

					STEED
			Valentine Peel. I see you've gone 
			back to using your original face.

					VALENTINE
			The last one you'll ever see.

					STEED
			Perish the thought.

	Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall.

					VALENTINE
			Did they tell you at Eton that I
			was fencing champion, too?

	Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto.

					STEED
			They said you were a very naughty 
			boy.

	The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller!


334     SEVERAL ANGLES

					VALENTINE
			You're better than I expected.

					STEED
			I was at Harrow ...

					VALENTINE
			But did they teach you this?

	Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A diminished phallic
	symbol.  Steed, dumbfounded.

	Valentine advances towards Steed --

	Who points the umbrella at him.

					STEED
			Bang-bang ... you're dead.

					VALENTINE
			You wish.

	He moves to close in, when ...


335     CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT

	from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --


336     VALENTINE

	recoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  Steed blows
	smoke away from the muzzle.

					STEED
			One shot -- for emergencies.

					VALENTINE
				(clutches wound)
			That's not playing by the rules.

					STEED
				(echoes Emma!)
			Rules are made to be broken.

					VALENTINE
				(pulls his own gun)
			If you say so.

					STEED
			I do.

	He FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor.

					VALENTINE
			You said ... one shot.

					STEED
			Did I? My mistake.

	Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind
	the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --

					VALENTINE
			I wouldn't do that, if I were you.

	Steed turns.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel -- !

	Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.

					VALENTINE
			Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the 
			thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's. 
			We'll be off now, won't we, darling?
				(to Steed)
			We wouldn't want to miss the
			fireworks. Figure it out if you can, 
			Steed ...


337     DOWN HATCH

	Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.


338     ON STEED

	He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control
	module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...


339     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The biggest cyclone you've ever seen starts slowly whirling above the city, gathering
	momentum ...


340     NUMBERS

	going down, down, down, as ...


341     INT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine drags Emma backwards ...


342     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The cyclone picking up force ...


343     CLOSEUP - STEED'S HANDS

	pull up a chip.  The red numbers freeze.  WIDEN to reveal...


344     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SIRENS CEASE.  Steed allows himself a smile of relief.


345     EXT.  LONDON - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

	The giant cyclone begins to break apart ...


346     SEVERAL ANGLES - DYING STORM


347     CLOSEUP - RELIEVED FACES

	Troops pulling off gas masks as ...


348     INT.  CONTROL ROOM - ON SCREENS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ...

	Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM reconfigures.
	A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words: 

	"AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES"

	start flashing ...

	A different set of numbers start running backwards ...

					STEED
			You must be joking ...

349     EXT.  CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Valentine, dragging Emma, reacts to the new ALARMS.

					VALENTINE
			Fool ...

	In his hesitation, Emma suddenly makes her move.  A struggle -- Emma takes a bad fall
	down a landing below.  Ugly THUD.  Dead.

					STEED
			That will do.

	He's materialized across the girder from Valentine.  Who pulls his revolver.

					VALENTINE
			Aren't you forgetting about
			something?

					STEED
			You are, and it's behind you.

					VALENTINE
			Come, come. You don't really
			expect me to fall for --

	Bad Emma's arms go 'round Valentine in a lethal embrace.

					VALENTINE
			Let go, you ... idiot ...

	Uh uh.  She holds him in a vice-like grip.  Hugging Valentine.

					STEED
			I think she really likes you ...
			Where's Mrs. Peel?

					VALENTINE
			Ugh ...

	As the life is squeezed out of him, Bad Emma finally smiles.  Cradled together, she
	chokes Valentine, who gasps for breath, as --

	One last desperate move on his part and Bad Emma tumbles backwards, Valentine
	locked in her arms in a dying embrace.

	They fall into the mists and liquid below.

	Steed almost falls himself as he grabs a beam for support.  Looks down, sees ...


350     EMMA

	Dead.

					STEED
			Emma!

	He has said her name.  He scrambles down to her body.

	Emma lying sprawled out on the ground.

	Steed picks up her limp body in his arms like "Sleeping Beauty."  His eyes fill with
	tears.  He lays her down.

					STEED
			Emma ...

	He produces Peter's ring.


351     CLOSEUP - RING

	Slips it onto her finger and ...


352     BACK TO SCENE

	Kisses her.  A chaste kiss on the lips.  But with the force and passion of a lover.  He
	closes his eyes, looks away in grief.  The ALARM STILL SOUNDS but Steed doesn't
	give a damn.

	Behind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  Looks up at
	him.

					EMMA
			Steed?

	Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight.

					STEED
			Mrs. Peel?

					EMMA
			What kept you?

					STEED
			The plot.
				(realizing)
			Hello, we must be going ...


353     CLOSEUP - AUTO-DESTRUCT NUMBERS

	Racing backwards as ...


354     SEVERAL ANGLES

	Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's Labyrinth ...


355     MORE NUMBERS

	racing to zero, nothing to stop them ...


356     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus.

					EMMA
			Quick!

	Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ...


357     SEVERAL ANGLES

	3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is
	fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES
	OUT.


358     EXT.  ALBERT BRIDGE - NIGHT

		Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas.


359     BELOW

	it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing ...

	Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath.

					STEED
			'The owl and the pussycat went
			to sea -'

					EMMA
			'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'

					STEED
			A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...

					EMMA
			Still a bit chilly ...

					STEED
			English weather. You know, after 
			all we've been through, I should 
			say we deserve a long holiday ...

					EMMA
			Have you any place in mind?

					STEED
			As a matter of fact I have ...

	The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight.

									
	SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


360     EXT.  SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY				360

	A few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them,
	WHIP CRACKED by a --

	Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and
	snow into --


361     SAND

	The peasant stops, stares.


362     AHEAD OF HIM

	Sun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  POPS a
	CHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to


363     TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS

	Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini.

					EMMA
			I don't recall Siberia being this
			warm, Steed.

					STEED
			It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.

					EMMA
			Our little paradise -- just made
			for two?

					STEED
				(looks; frowns)
			Not quite.

	On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption --
	with Brenda.  He waves to --

					STEED
			Our chaperon.

					EMMA
			Pity your mother came, too ...

	Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  Trubshaw
	pours glasses of champagne.

					STEED
			Still a little warm, Trubshaw.
			Is this the '28? A little more
			ice, I think ...

	Trubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother moves in.  Absorbed
	by Emma, now his new protegee.

					MOTHER
			About your next assignment, Mrs.
			Peel ...

					EMMA
			Next assignment?

	Steed gives his champagne to the Siberian peasant.  He presses a switch -- an umbrella
	shoots up between them, opens up, twirls.

	PULL BACK to reveal the strip of beach, like a tiny bubble of tropical weather. 
	Against a Siberian b.g. of snow.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a giant glass bubble,
	hearing --

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops
			nearby?

					STEED (V.O.)
			Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll
			send Mother ...

	PULL BACK to reveal no shop for miles around.

					MOTHER (V.O.)
			Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps
			another macaroon ...

					EMMA (V.O.)
			Thank you, Steed.

					STEED (V.O.)
			Thank you, Mrs. Peel.

	Behind the umbrella -- LAUGHTER.  CHINK of GLASSES.

									
			FADE OUT.




					THE END
THE AVENGERS

          BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT.

          Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE
          OTHER, bows.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
           little world. A human world. They would
           wield its power,...

                          CUT TO:
          THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           But our ally knows its workings as they
           never will. He is ready to lead. And
           our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

          HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a

          EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY ­ NIGHT

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY
           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY
           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY
           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY
           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Campus should be clear in the next half
           hour.

                          NICK FURY
           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY
           We should tell them to go back to
           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           If we can't control the Tesseract's
           energy, there may not be a minimum safe
           distance.

                          NICK FURY
           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, is that really a priority right
           now?

                          NICK FURY
           Until such time as the world ends, we
           will act as though it intends to spin
           on. Clear out the tech below. Every
           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.
           (to standing agents)
           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY
           Talk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG
           Director.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG
           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG
           No, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG
           She's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY
           We've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG
           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY
           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG
           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY
           I gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY
           Are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)
           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON
           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

                          NICK FURY
           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY
           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI
           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI
           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)
           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI
           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

                          SELVIG
           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY
           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI
           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY
           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI
           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

                          NICK FURY
           Free from what?

                          LOKI
           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI
           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY
           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

                          NICK FURY
           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG
           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI
           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON
           (pointing to the Loki team)
           Need these vehicles.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON
           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY
           (through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!
          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY
           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY
           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

          EXT. VAN ­ NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD ­ CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER ­ NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.
          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is with the hostile
           force. I have men down. Hill?

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL ­ NIGHT

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
          luckily, not her.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           A lot of men still under, don't know
           how many survivors.

          EXT. DESERT ­ NIGHT


                          NICK FURY
           Sound the general call. I want every
           living soul not working rescue looking
           for that brief case.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Roger that.

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson, get back to base. This is a
           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
           war.
          A beat.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           What do we do?
          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR ­ NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV
           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

                          NATASHA
           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV
           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA
           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV
           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA
           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV
           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG
           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV
           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA
           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA
           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV
           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA
           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

                          NATASHA
           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA
           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We don't know.

                          NATASHA
           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We think so. I'll brief you on
           everything when you get back. But
           first, we need you to talk to the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
           about as far as he can throw me.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No, I've got Stark. You get the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Bozhe moi.

          EXT. INDIAN SLUM ­ NIGHT

          A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way
          through.

          INT. SHACK ­ NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN
           What are doing here?! Get out! You
           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL
           I have to see the doctor! It's my
           father!

                          BANNER
           Calm down. What's wrong?

                          LITTLE GIRL
           My father...
          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER
           Is he like them?
          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS ­ CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER
           Should have got paid up front, Banner.
          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA
           You know, for a man who's supposed to
           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER
           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA
           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER
           You brought me to the edge of the city,
           smart. I uh... assume the whole place
           is surrounded?

                          NATASHA
           Just you and me.

                          BANNER
           And your actress buddy, is she a spy
           too? Do they start that young?

                          NATASHA
           I did.

                          BANNER
           Who are you?

                          NATASHA
           Natasha Romanoff.

                          BANNER
           Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
           Because that's not gonna work out for
           everyone.

                          NATASHA
           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER
           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA
           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

                          BANNER
           Why?

                          NATASHA
           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

                          BANNER
           What if I said no?

                          NATASHA
           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER
           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA
           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

                          BANNER
           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA
           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

                          BANNER
           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA
           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER
           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
           it?

                          NATASHA
           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER
           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA
           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER
           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA
           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER
           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA
           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!
          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER
           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA
           Stand down. We're good here.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack
          outside.

          INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK ­ NIGHT

          Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.

                          BANNER
           Just you and me?
          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           This is out of line, Director. You're
           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY
           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
           a firefight? Did you feel an
           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           You saying that this Asgard has
           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY
           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           He can't be working alone. What about
           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY
           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Which is why you should be focusing on
           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY
           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY
           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           We're running the world's greatest
           covert security network and you're
           gonna leave the fate of human race to a
           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
           need a response team. These people
           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY
           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)
           There's not enough time! I gotta put
           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)
           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA ­ DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST
           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM ­ NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY
           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE
           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY
           Then you should be out, celebrating,
           seeing the world.
          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE
           I went under, the world was at war, I
           wake up, they say we won. They didn't
           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY
           We've made some mistakes along the way.
           Some very recently.

                          STEVE
           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

                          STEVE
           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY
           Trying to save it.
          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE
           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE
           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY
           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

                          STEVE
           At this point, I doubt anything would
           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY
           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything you can tell us about
           the Tesseract that we ought to know
           now?

                          STEVE
           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN ­ NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY
           You're good on this end. The rest is up
           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS
           (on the other line)
           You disconnected the transition lines?
           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY
           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER
           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
           and it actually works?

                          TONY
           I assume. Light her up.
          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER
           How does it look?

                          TONY
           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER
           Gotta go wider on the public awareness
           campaign. You need to do some press. I
           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY
           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER
           Then get in here and I will.
          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
          gadgets.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
           line.

                          TONY
           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY
           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE ­ NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER
           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY
           Of course they are, I was directly
           involved. Which brings me to my next
           question: how does it feel to be a
           genius?

                          PEPPER
           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
           would I?

                          TONY
           What do you mean? All this came from
           you.

                          PEPPER
           No. All this came from that.
          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY
           Give yourself some credit, please.
           Stark Tower is your baby. Give
           yourself... twelve percent of the
           credit.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent?

                          TONY
           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY
           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
           And sorry, but the security snafu? That
           was on you.

                          PEPPER
           Oooooh.

                          TONY
           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER
           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY
           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
           going to pay for that comment about
           percentages in some subtle way later,
           aren't I?
          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER
           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY
           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER
           On the lease.

                          TONY
           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS
           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY
           You have reached the life model decoy
           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This is urgent.

                          TONY
           Then leave it urgently.
          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY
           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)
           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY
           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER
           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY
           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to look this over.
           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)
           Soon as possible.

                          TONY
           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER
           That's alright, `cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Thank you.

                          TONY
           Official consulting hours are between
           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER
           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

                          TONY
           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER
           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY
           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER
           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't about personality profiles
           anymore.

                          TONY
           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

                          TONY
           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

                          PEPPER
           I was having twelve percent of a
           moment. This seems serious, Phil's
           pretty shaken.

                          TONY
           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER
           What is all of this?

                          TONY
           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

                          TONY
           This.
          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER
           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

                          TONY
           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER
           You've got homework. You've got a lot
           of homework.

                          TONY
           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER
           If you didn't?

                          TONY
           Yeah.

                          PEPPER
           You mean if you finished?
           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY
           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER
           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

                          PILOT
           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE
           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE
           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE
           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE
           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB ­ DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM ­ NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER
           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI
           Let them go at themselves. I will lead
           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER
           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

                          LOKI
           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER
           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

                          LOKI
           I was a king! The rightful king of
           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER
           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

                          LOKI
           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

                          LOKI
           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER
           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP ­ DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE
           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA
           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)
           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA
           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

                          STEVE
           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA
           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

                          STEVE
           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER
           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

                          STEVE
           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER
           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE
           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER
           (takes in the sentiment)
           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE
           Well, this is actually kind of
           familiar.

                          NATASHA
           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
           to breath.
          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

                          STEVE
           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER
           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP ­ a flurry of
          activity ­ dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY
           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY
           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER
           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY
           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER
           Where are you with that?
          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We're sweeping every wirelessly
           accessible camera on the planet.
           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
           us.

                          NATASHA
           That's still not gonna find them in
           time.

                          BANNER
           You have to narrow the field. How many
           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY
           How many are there?

                          BANNER
           Call every lab you know, tell them to
           put the spectrometers on the roof and
           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
           rough out a tracking algorithm based on
           cluster recognition. At least we could
           rule out a few places. Do you have
           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you show
           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA
           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM ­ DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG
           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)
           Where did you find all these people?

                          CLINT BARTON
           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
           Doctor.
          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG
           Yeah, iridium. It's found in
           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

                          SELVIG
           Well, I didn't know!
           (sees Loki coming)
           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
           much. It's more than just knowledge,
           it's... truth.

                          LOKI
           I know. What did it show you, Agent
           Barton?

                          CLINT BARTON
           My next target.

                          LOKI
           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I'll need a distraction.
           (grabs his bow)
           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE
           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
           of years to collect them all. Near
           mint, slight foxing around the edges,
           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
           nine percent.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
           He's not exactly hiding.

                          NICK FURY
           Captain, you're up.
          Steve nods. Leaves.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER ­ NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!
          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM ­ NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
          screen.
          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA ­ NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI
           Kneel before me.
          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI
           I said. KNEEL!!!
          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI
           Is not this simpler? Is this not your
           natural state? It's the unspoken truth
           of humanity, that you crave
           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
           diminishes your life's joy in a mad
           scramble for power, for identity. You
           were made to be ruled. In the end, you
           will always kneel.
          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI
           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI
           Look to your elder, people. Let him be
           an example.
          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You know, the last time I was in
           Germany and saw a man standing above
           everybody else, we ended up
           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)
           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm not the one who's out of time.
          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA
           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI
           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Not today!
          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
          FLIPS him over.

          INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT


                          NATASHA
           The guy's all over the place.
          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
          speakers.

                          IRON MAN
           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
          Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his
          IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN
          touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry
          the suit has.

                          IRON MAN
           Make your move, Reindeer Games.
          Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes
          away.

                          IRON MAN
           Good move.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Mr. Stark.

                          IRON MAN
           Captain.

          INT. QUINJET ­ NIGHT

          Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury
          speaks over her headset.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Said anything?

                          NATASHA
           Not a word.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Just get him here. We're low on time.
          With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch
          from a distance, whispering.

                          STEVE
           I don't like it.

                          TONY
           What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

                          STEVE
           I don't remember it being ever that
           easy. This guy packs a wallop.

                          TONY
           Still, you are pretty spry, for an
           older fellow. What's your thing?
           Pilates?

                          STEVE
           What?

                          TONY
           It's like calisthenics. You might have
           missed a couple things, you know, doing
           time as a Capsicle.
          Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

                          STEVE
           Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
           in.

                          TONY
           Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
           doesn't tell you.
          THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
          violently.

                          NATASHA
           Where's this coming from?
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

                          STEVE
           What's the matter? Scared of a little
           lightning?

                          LOKI
           I'm not overly fond of what follows.
          What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
          Not a light. A King.
          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
          throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
          puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

                          IRON MAN
           Now there's that guy.

                          NATASHA
           Another Asgardian?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Think the guy's a friendly?

                          IRON MAN
           Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
           kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
          Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
          Thor.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, we need a plan of attack!

                          IRON MAN
           I have a plan. Attack.
          IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
          parachute to follow.

                          NATASHA
           I'd sit this one out, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I don't see how I can.

                          NATASHA
           These guys come from legends, they're
           basically gods.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
           pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
          Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE ­ NIGHT

          Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR.
          He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
          angry to see him alive in this fashion.

                          THOR
           Where is the Tesseract?

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           I missed you too.

                          THOR
           Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

                          LOKI
           Oh, you should thank me. With the
           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
           the Allfather have to muster to conjure
           you here? Your precious Earth.
          Thor drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
          Loki. His brother.
          Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
          everything to a man or god.

                          THOR
           I thought you dead.

                          LOKI
           Did you mourn?

                          THOR
           We all did. Our father...

                          LOKI
           Your father. He did tell you my true
           parentage, did he not?
          Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
          bigger wedge between them.

                          THOR
           We were raised together, we played
           together, we fought together. Do you
           remember none of that?

                          LOKI

                          (TURNS AROUND)
           I remember a shadow. Living in the
           shade of your greatness. I remember you
           tossing me into an abyss. I was and
           should be king!

                          THOR
           So you take the world I love as
           recompense for your imagined slights.
           No, the Earth is under my protection,
           Loki.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           And you're doing a marvelous job with
           that. The humans slaughter each other
           in droves, while you idly threat. I
           mean to rule them. And why should I
           not?

                          THOR
           You think yourself above them.

                          LOKI
           Well, yes.

                          THOR
           Then you miss the truth of ruling,
           brother. Throne would suit you ill.
          Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
          to the ledge. Turns around.

                          LOKI
           I've seen worlds you've never known
           about! I have grown, Odinson, in my
           exile! I have seen the true power of
           the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

                          THOR
           Who showed you this power? Who controls
           the would-be-king?

                          LOKI
           I am a king!

                          THOR
           Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
           You give up this poisonous dream! You
           come home.

                          LOKI
           I don't have it. You need the cube to
           bring me home, but I've sent it off I
           know not where.
          Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.

                          THOR
           You listen well, brother. I...

          THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

          MID-FLIGHT.

                          LOKI
           I'm listening.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
          IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
          opens up.

                          THOR
           Do not touch me again!

                          TONY
           Then don't take my stuff.

                          THOR
           You have no idea what you're dealing
           with.

                          TONY
           Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
           know you weareth her drapes?

                          THOR
           This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
           will face Asgardian justice!

                          TONY
           He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
           Until then, stay out of my way...
           tourist.
          The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
          move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
          across into a tree.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Okay.
          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
          his hand. Mjölnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjölnir to his hand, raises
          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
          the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
          increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Power at 400% capacity.

                          TONY
           How about that?
          IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
          knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON
          MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

          EXT. SKY ­ NIGHT

          The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
          him into the side of a mountain.
          THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

          EXT. FOREST ­ CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
          tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back Mjölnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
          top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Hey! That's enough!
           (comes down; looks at Thor)
           Now, I don't know what you plan on
           doing here.

                          THOR
           I've come here to put an end to Loki's
           schemes!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Then prove it! Put the hammer down.

                          IRON MAN
           Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his
           hammer!

          THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJÖLNIR.
          Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,
          raises the hammer.

                          THOR

                          (TO CAP)
           You want me to put the hammer down?

          THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR
          brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION
          OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE

          SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.
          IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right
          next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks
          at both men.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are we done here?

          THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.

          INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY ­ NIGHT

          DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
          smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working
          on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,
          nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE
          GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control
          panel of the cell.

                          NICK FURY
           In case it's unclear. You try to
           escape. You so much as scratch that
           glass.
          Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's
          cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.
          Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit
          his pants. Not a god, though.

                          NICK FURY
           Thirty thousand feet, straight down in
           a steel trap. You get how that works?!
          Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.

                          NICK FURY
           Ant.
          Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel
          trap.

           Boot.

                          LOKI

                          (SMIRKING)
           It's an impressive cage. Not built, I
           think, for me.

                          NICK FURY
           Built for something a lot stronger than
           you.

                          LOKI
           Oh, I've heard.
          Loki looks into the camera.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS

          The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.
          Banner looks at the monitor, intently.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ CONTINUOUS


                          LOKI
           The mindless beast, makes play he's
           still a man. How desperate are you,
           that you call upon such lost creatures
           to defend you?

                          NICK FURY
           How desperate am I? You threaten my
           world with war. You steal a force you
           can't hope to control.

                          (MORE)

           NICK FURY (CONT'D)
           You talk about peace and you kill
           `cause it's fun. You have made me very
           desperate. You might not be glad that
           you did.

                          LOKI
           Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To
           have the Tesseract, to have power,
           unlimited power. And for what? A warm
           light for all mankind to share, and
           then to be reminded what real power is.

                          NICK FURY

                          (SMILING)
           Well, you let me know if Real Power
           wants a magazine or something.
          Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back
          at the camera, smirking.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ CONTINUOUS

          Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't
          even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all
          just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

                          BANNER
           He really grows on you, doesn't he?

                          STEVE
           Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,
           what's his play?

                          THOR

                          (COMING TOO)
           He has an army called the Chitauri.
           They're not of Asgard or any world
           known. He means to lead them against
           your people. They will win him the
           earth. In return, I suspect, for the
           Tesseract.

                          STEVE

                          (SERIOUSLY)
           An army? From outer space?

                          BANNER
          So he's building another portal. That's
          what he needs Erik Selvig for.

                          THOR
          Selvig?

                          BANNER
          He's an astrophysicist.

                          THOR
          He's a friend.

                          NATASHA
          Loki has him under some kind of spell,
          along with one of ours.

                          STEVE
          I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
          He's not leading an army from here.

                          BANNER
          I don't think we should be focusing on
          Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of
          cats, you could smell crazy on him.

                          THOR
          Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond
          reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's
          my brother.

                          NATASHA
          He killed eighty people in two days.

                          THOR
          He's adopted.

                          BANNER
          Iridium, what did they need the Iridium
          for?

                          TONY
          It's a stabilizing agent.
           (walks in with Coulson; to

                          COULSON)
          I'll fly you there. Keep the love
          alive. Means the portal won't collapse
          on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

                          (TO THOR)
           No hard feelings, Point Break. You've
           got a mean swing.
           (referring to the Iridium)
           Also, it means the portal can open as
           wide, and stay open as long, as Loki
           wants.

                          (TO CREW)
           Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top
           sails. That man is playing GALAGA!
           Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.
           (covering his eye, looks

                          AROUND)
           How does Fury do this?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           He turns.
          Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING
          IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.

                          TONY
           Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest
           of the raw materials, Agent Barton can
           get his hands on pretty easily. Only
           major component he still needs is a
           power source. A high energy density,
           something to kick start the cube.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           When did you become an expert in
           thermonuclear astrophysics?

                          TONY
           Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,
           the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the
           only one who did the reading?

                          STEVE
           Does Loki need any particular kind of
           power source?

                          BANNER
           He's got to heat the cube to a
           hundredand twenty million Kelvin just
           to break through the Coulomb barrier.

                          TONY
           Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
           stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

                          BANNER
           Well, if he could do that he could
           achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
           on the planet.

                          TONY
           Finally, someone who speaks English.

                          STEVE
           Is that what just happened?
          Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as
          the mutual respect for each other shows.

                          TONY
           It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
           You're work on anti-electron collisions
           is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
           the way you lose control and turn into
           an enormous green rage monster.

                          BANNER

                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Thanks.

                          NICK FURY

                          (WALKING IN)
           Dr. Banner is only here to track the
           cube. I was hoping you might join him.

                          STEVE
           Let's start with that stick of his. It
           may be magical, but it works an awful
           lot like a HYDRA weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           I don't know about that, but it is
           powered by the cube. And I'd like to
           know how Loki used it to turn two of
           the sharpest men I know into his
           personal flying monkeys.

                          THOR
           Monkeys? I do not understand.

                          STEVE
           I do! I understood that reference.
          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

                          TONY
           Shall we play, doctor?

                          BANNER
           Let's play some.
          As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
          discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
          playing.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

          Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
          the scepter for radiation.
          Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
          algorithms and equations.

                          BANNER
           The gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with Selvig's reports on the
           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
           process.

                          TONY
           If we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops.

                          BANNER
           All I packed was a tooth brush.

                          TONY

                          (SMILES)
           You know, you should come by STARK
           TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all
           R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

                          BANNER
           Thanks, but the last time I was in New
           York I kind of broke...Harlem.

                          TONY
           Well, I promise a stress free
           environment. No tension. No surprises.
          Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.
          Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.

                          BANNER

           OW!
          Tony looks at Banner closely.

                          TONY
           Nothing?

                          STEVE

                          (TO BANNER)
           Hey! Are you nuts?

                          TONY
           You really have got a lid on it,
           haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow
           jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

                          STEVE
           Is everything a joke to you?

                          TONY
           Funny things are.

                          STEVE
           Threatening the safety of everyone on
           this ship isn't funny. No offense,
           doctor.

                          BANNER
           No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come
           aboard if I couldn't handle pointy
           things.

                          TONY
           You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to
           strut.

                          STEVE
           And you need to focus on the problem,
           Mr. Stark.

                          TONY
           You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us
           and why now? Why not before? What isn't
           he telling us? I can't do the equation
           unless I have all the variables.

                          STEVE
           You think Fury's hiding something?

                          TONY
           He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His
           secrets have secrets.
           (points to Banner)
           It's bugging him too, isn't it?

                          BANNER
           (bobbling the words)
           Uh...I just wanna finish my work here
           and...

                          STEVE
           Doctor?
          A beat.

                          BANNER
           'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's
           jab at Fury about the cube.

                          STEVE
           I heard it.

                          BANNER
           (pointing at Tony)
           Well, I think that was meant for you.
           Even if Barton didn't post that all
           over the news.

                          STEVE
           The Stark Tower? That big ugly
           (Tony gives him a look)
           ...building in New York?

                          BANNER
          It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-
          sustaining energy source. That building
          will run itself for what, a year?

                          TONY
          That's just the prototype. I'm kind of
          the only name in clean energy right
          now.

                          BANNER
           (referring to Tony)
          So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on
          the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
          they doing in the energy business in
          the first place?

                          TONY
          I should probably look into that once
          my decryption programmer finishes
          breaking into all of SHIELD's secure
          files.

                          STEVE
           (taken by that)
          I'm sorry, did you say...?

                          TONY
          Jarvis has been running it since I hit
          the bridge. In a few hours we'll know
          every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
          tried to hide.
           (holds out a bag of blueberries)
          Blueberry?

                          STEVE
          Yet you're confused about why they
          didn't want you around?

                          TONY
          An intelligence organization that fears
          intelligence? Historically, not
          possible.

                          STEVE
           I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
           This is a man who means to start a war,
           and if don't stay focused, he'll
           succeed. We have orders, we should
           follow them.

                          TONY
           Following is not really my style.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           And you're all about style, aren't you?

                          TONY
           (a nerve hit)
           Of the people in this room, which one
           is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.
           not of use?

                          BANNER
           Steve, tell me none of this smells a
           little funky to you?
          Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
          shakes it off.

                          STEVE
           Just find the cube.
          Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,
          he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.

          BACK IN THE LAB

                          TONY
           That's the guy my dad never shut up
           about? Wondering if they shouldn't have
           kept him on ice.

                          BANNER
           The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does
           have the jump on us.

                          TONY
           What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm
           gonna be there when it does.

                          BANNER
           And I'll read all about it.

                          TONY
           Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like
           the rest of us.

                          BANNER
           Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
           I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a
           nightmare.

                          TONY
           You know, I've got a cluster of
           shrapnel, trying every second to crawl
           its way into my heart.
           (points at the MINI-ARC
           REACTOR in his chest)
           This stops it. This little circle of
           light. It's part of me now, not just
           armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

                          BANNER
           But you can control it.

                          TONY
           Because I learned how.

                          BANNER
           It's different.
          Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
          data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

                          TONY
           Hey, I've read all about your accident.
           That much gamma exposure should have
           killed you.

                          BANNER
           So you're saying that the Hulk... the
           other guy... saved my life?

                          (MORE)

                          BANNER (CONT'D)
           That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.
           Saved it for what?

                          TONY

                          (A BEAT)
           I guess we'll find out.
          Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

                          BANNER
           You might not like that.

                          TONY
           You just might.

          INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C ­ NIGHT

          Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and
          STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,
          filled with METAL CRATES stacked.
          Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds
          onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

          INT. VAN ­ NIGHT

          Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are
          driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig
          carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal
          prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS
          ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM ­ NIGHT

          On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor
          looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           As soon as Loki took the doctor we
           moved Jane Foster. We've got an
           excellent observatory in Traunsee. She
           was asked to consult there very
           suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,
           private plane, very remote. She'll be
           safe.

                          THOR
           Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking
           Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for
           him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He talks about you a lot. You changed
           his life. You changed everything around
           here.

                          THOR
           They were better as they were. We
           pretend on Asgard that we're more
           advanced, but we...we come here
           battling like BILCHSTEIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Like what?

                          THOR
           BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big
           antlers. You don't have those?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Don't think so.

                          THOR
           They are repulsive, and they trample
           everything in their path.
          Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the
          window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

                          THOR
           When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
           followed me here and your people paid
           the price. And now again. In my youth I
           courted war.

           NICK FURY (O.S.)
           War hasn't started yet.

                          (WALKING IN)
           You think you can make Loki tell us
           what the Tesseract is?

                          THOR
           I do not know. Loki's mind is far
           afield, it's not just power he craves,
           it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain
           that would prize his need from him.

                          NICK FURY
           A lot of guys think that, until the
           pain stops.

                          THOR
           What are you asking me to do?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm asking. What are you prepared to
           do?

                          THOR
           Loki is a prisoner.

                          NICK FURY
           Then why do I feel like he's the only
           person on this boat that wants to be
           here?
          Thor doesn't answer.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he
          stops.

                          LOKI
           There's not many people that can sneak
           up on me.
           (turns to see NATASHA

                          STANDING THERE)

                          NATASHA
           But you figured I'd come.

                          LOKI
           After. After whatever tortures Fury can
           concoct, you would appear as a friend,
           as a balm. And I would cooperate.

                          NATASHA
          I wanna know what you've done to Agent
          Barton.

                          LOKI
          I'd say I've expanded his mind.

                          NATASHA
          And once you've won. Once you're king
          of the mountain. What happens to his
          mind?

                          LOKI
          Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

                          NATASHA
          Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

                          LOKI

                          (SITTING DOWN)
          Tell me.

                          NATASHA
           (she pulls up a chair as

                          WELL)
          Before I worked for SHIELD, I
          uh...well, I made a name for myself. I
          have a very specific skillset. I didn't
          care who I used it for, or on. I got on
          SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent
          Barton was sent to kill me, he made a
          different call.

                          LOKI
          And what will you do if I vow to spare
          him?

                          NATASHA
          Not let you out.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
          Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in
          the balance, and you bargain for one
          man?

                          NATASHA
           Regimes fall every day. I tend not to
           weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

                          LOKI
           What is it you want?

                          NATASHA
           It's really not that complicated. I've
           got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe
           it out.

                          LOKI
           Can you? Can you wipe out that much
           red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE
           HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me
           everything. Your ledger is dripping,
           it's gushing red, and you think saving
           a man no more virtuous than yourself
           will change anything?

                          (STANDING; ANGRY)
           This is the basest sentimentality. This
           is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

                         INTERCUTS
          - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You lie and kill in the service of
           liars and killers.
          - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury
          oversees.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You pretend to be separate, to have
           your own code, something that makes up
           for the horrors. But they are a part of
           you, and they will never go away!
          - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and
          looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

          HYDRA WEAPONS.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ NIGHT

          Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

                          LOKI
           I won't touch Barton. Not until I make
           him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In
           every way he knows you fear! And when
           he'll wake just long enough to see his
           good work, and when he screams, I'll
           split his skull! This is my bargain,
           you mewling quim!
          NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

                          NATASHA

                          (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)
           You're a monster.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           No, you brought the monster.

                          NATASHA
           (turns back around; poised)
           So, Banner... that's your play.

                          LOKI

                          (STAGGERED)
           What?

                          NATASHA

                          (ON EARPIECE)
           Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep
           Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send
           Thor as well.

                          (TO LOKI)
           Thank you for your cooperation.
          Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on
          the scepter.

                          NICK FURY

                          (ANGRY)
           What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

                          TONY
           Uh...kind of been wondering the same
           thing about you.

                          NICK FURY
           You're supposed to be locating the
           Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           We are. The model's locked and we're
           sweeping for the signature now. When we
           get a hit, we'll have the location
           within half a mile.

                          TONY
           And you'll get your cube back, no muss,
           no fuss.
           (suddenly his monitor show a
           collection of SECRET FILES)
           What is PHASE 2?
          Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing
          Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

                          STEVE
           PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make
           weapons.

                          (TO TONY)
           Sorry, the computer was moving a little
           slow.

                          NICK FURY
           (trying to explain)
           Rogers, we gathered everything related
           to the Tesseract. This does not mean
           that we're...

                          TONY
           I'm sorry, Nick.
          Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

          THE WEAPONS.

                          TONY
           What were you lying?

                          STEVE
           I was wrong, director. The world hasn't
           changed a bit.
          At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha
          keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

                          BANNER
           Did you know about this?

                          NATASHA
           You wanna think about removing yourself
           from this environment, doctor?

                          BANNER
           I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well
           removed.

                          NATASHA
           Loki's manipulating you.

                          BANNER
           And you've been doing what exactly?

                          NATASHA
           You didn't come here because I bat my
           eyelashes at you.

                          BANNER
           Yes, and I'm not leaving because
           suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd
           like to know why SHIELD is using the
           Tesseract to build weapons of mass
           destruction.

                          NICK FURY
           Because of him.
           (pointing at Thor)

                          THOR

                          (STUNNED)
           Me?

                          NICK FURY
          Last year earth had a visitor from
          another planet who had a grudge match
          that leveled a small town. We learned
          that not only are we not alone, but we
          are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

                          THOR
          My people want nothing but peace with
          your planet.

                          NICK FURY
          But you're not the only people out
          there, are you? And, you're not the
          only threat. The world's filling up
          with people who can't be matched, they
          can't be controlled.

                          STEVE
          Like you controlled the cube?

                          THOR
          You're work with the Tesseract is what
          drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is
          the signal to all the realms that the
          earth is ready for a higher form of
          war.

                          STEVE
          A higher form?

                          NICK FURY
          You forced our hand. We had to come up
          with something.

                          TONY
          Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always
          calms everything right down.

                          NICK FURY
          Remind me again how you made your
          fortune, Stark?

                          STEVE TONY
          I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is
          weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?
          deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR
          everything?
           I thought humans were more
           evolved than this.

                          NICK FURY
           Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet
           and blow stuff up?

                          THOR
           Did you always give your champions such
           mistrust?

                          NATASHA BANNER
          Are you all really that Captain America is on
          naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential
          threats? watch list?

                          TONY STEVE
           (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
          You're on that list? Are you more crack...
          above or below angry bees?
          Threatening! I feel
          threatened!
          As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's
          scepter is glowing brightly.

          INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER ­ DAY

          Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the
          ship.

           SHIELD BASE VOICE
           661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.
           What is your hull, over?

                          BARTON
           Arms to ammunition, over.
          Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton
          pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off
          each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

                          THOR
           You speak of control, yet you court
           chaos.

                          BANNER
           It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what
           are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a
           chemical mixture that makes chaos.
           We're... we're a time-bomb.

                          NICK FURY
           You need to step away.

                          TONY
           (puts his arm around Steve)
           Why shouldn't the guy let off a little
           steam?

                          STEVE
           (pushes Tony off)
           You know damn well why! Back off!

                          TONY
           (comes face-to-face with Cap)
           Oh, I'm starting to want you to make
           me.

                          STEVE
           Big man in a suit of armor. Take that
           off, what are you?

                          TONY
           Genius, billionaire, playboy,
           philanthropist.

                          STEVE
           I know guys with none of that worth ten
           of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

                          (MORE)

                          STEVE (CONT'D)
           The only thing you really fight for is
           yourself. You're not the guy to make
           the sacrifice play, to lay down on a
           wire and let the other guy crawl over
           you.

                          TONY
           I think I would just cut the wire.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           Always a way out... You know, you may
           not be a threat, but you better stop
           pretending to be a hero.

                          TONY
           (that did it)
           A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,
           Rogers. Everything special about you
           came out of a bottle!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one
          of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding
          out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points
          right at the engine.
          Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred
          feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then
          SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the
          engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just
          stands there, unmoving.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
          Thor laughs at them.

                          THOR
           You people are so petty... and tiny.
          Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

                          BANNER
           Yeah, this is a tee...

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you escort
           Dr.Banner back to his...

                          BANNER
           Where? You rented my room.

                          NICK FURY
           The cell was just in case...

                          BANNER
           In case you needed to kill me, but you
           can't! I know! I tried!

                          (A BEAT)
           I got low. I didn't see an end, so I
           put a bullet in my mouth and the other
           guy spit it out! So I moved on. I
           focused on helping other people. I was
           good, until you dragged me back into
           this freak show and put everyone here
           at risk!
          Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets
          unnerved.

                          BANNER
           You wanna know my secret, Agent
           Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay
           calm?
          BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

                          STEVE
           Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

          BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S
          SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

                          TONY
           Got it.
          Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

                          BANNER
           Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my
           little party trick after all.

                          THOR
           Located the Tesseract?

                          TONY
           I can get there faster.

                          STEVE
           Look, all of us...

                          THOR
           The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no
           human is a match for it.
          Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

                          STEVE
           You're not going alone!

                          TONY
           You gonna stop me?

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's find out.

                          TONY
           I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit.
          At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices
          something about the Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           Oh, my God!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

          ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING

          Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and
          Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the
          lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit!

                          TONY
           Yep!
          Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching
          his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

                          NICK FURY
           Hill?!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers
          activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning
          scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the
          bridge as calm as possible.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is
           down! Can we get a run in?
           (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER)
           Talk to me.

                          GALAGA PLAYER
           (points to monitor)
           Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but
           it's impossible to get out there and
           make repairs while we're in the air.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We lose one more engine, we won't be.
           Somebody's got to get inside and patch
           that engine.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB ­ MORNING


                          NICK FURY
           Stark! You copy that?!

           TONY (V.O.)
           I'm on it!

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson! Initiate official lock down in
           the detention section then get to the
           armory! Move out!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ MORNING

          Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having
          landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain
          control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

                          NATASHA (CONT'D)
           (quietly, to herself)
           I'm okay. We're okay, right?

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY

          Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel
          down into a corridor.

                          BARTON
           Get that engine down! Detention! Get
           him through the dark! Come with me.
          Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.

          EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER ­ MORNING

          Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.

                          TONY
           Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
          Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's
          IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ CONTINUOUS

          ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress
          the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.
          Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

                          NATASHA
           Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.
           This is just what Loki wants. We're
           gonna be okay. Listen to me.
          Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She
          furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

                          NATASHA
           We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on
           my life I will get you out of this, you
           will walk away, and never...

                          BANNER
           Your life?
          His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
          morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the
          carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the
          lights go out.

                          NATASHA

                          (PLEADING)
           Bruce.
          Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives
          Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the
          rubble. She stops.
          The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a
          disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK
          chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
          She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
          pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
          Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
          stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
          anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Loki looks up, smiling mischievously.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than
          before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray.

                          NICK FURY
           Bring the carrier inwards and head
           south. Take us to the water.

                          HELMSMAN
           Why water? Navigations recalibrated
           after the engine failure.

                          NICK FURY
           Is the sun coming up?!

                          HELMSMAN
           Yes, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Then put it on the left! Get us over
           water! One more turbine goes down and
           we drop.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to
          portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire
          extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do
          anything.
          Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN

          OFF.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, I'm here!

                          TONY
           Good. See what we got.
          Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged
          engine.

          INSIDE THE SUIT
          Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and
          its layouts.

                          TONY
           I gotta get this super conducting
           cooling system back online before I can
           access the rotors and work on
           dislodging the debris.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.

                          IRON MAN
           I need you to get to that engine
           control panel and tell me which relays
           are in overload position.
          IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a
          man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

                          IRON MAN
           What's it look like in there?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           It seems to run on some form of
           electricity.

                          IRON MAN
           Well, you're not wrong.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.
          Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.
          Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
          and spins.
          ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
          nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
          SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of
          corridors. The sound the monster is coming.
          Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind
          her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.
          Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

          SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.
          The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has
          never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS
          KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ CONTINUOUS

          Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the
          hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK
          stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.
          The HULK makes his move.
          SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
          HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
          off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
          wraps around it.

                          THOR
           We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to
           think!
          HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

          FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine
          engine. It's bad, but still fixable.

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           The relays are intact. What's our next
           move?

                          TONY
           Even if I clear the rotors, this thing
           won't re-engage without a jump. I'm
           gonna have to get in there and push.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Well if that thing gets up to speed,
           you'll get shredded!

                          TONY
           Then stay in the control unit and
           reverse polarity long enough to
           disengage mag...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Speak English!

                          TONY
           See that red lever? It'll slow the
           rotors down long enough for me to get
           out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He
          sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY

          Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
          head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
          off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
          out.
          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
          right at him. At the last second, MJÖLNIR flies into his hand
          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
          happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
          jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

          THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
          Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
          Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
          heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
          can't. Mjölnir rests atop his hand.
          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
          hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
          CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors.

                          NICK FURY
           We need a full evac on the lower hangar
           bay.
          Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE
          appears.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           GRENADE!
          The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a
          shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the
          entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,
          waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.
          A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop
          one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,
          who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.

          INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION ­ DAY

          Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into
          a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
           We got perimeter breach! Hostiles are
           in SHIELD gear. Hold on to every
           junction.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT ­ DAY

          HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK
          grabs him by the neck.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally
          efficient tactical soldiers.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (V.O.)
           Sir, the HULK and Thor are in shuttle
           levels 2, 3 and 4!

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, the Hulk will tear this place
           apart!

                          NICK FURY
           Get his attention.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           (on her EARPIECE)
           Escort 606, proceed to 270 MAIN
           SHUTTLE! Don't get too close.

          ESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going
          between Thor and the HULK.

           Target acquired. Target engaged.
           (pulls the trigger; fires
           guns at HULK)
          A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for
          cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He
          jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

          ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

                          ESCORT 606 PILOT

           TARGET ANGRY! TARGET ANGRY!
          HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK
          tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but

          HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

          THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.
          ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

          PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS
          on it, relieving the rotors.
          On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as
          they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with
          Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as
          throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
          for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
          down at them.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
          are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

                          NICK FURY
           They are not getting through here, so
           what the hell...
          Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
          critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
          Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

          OUTLETS.
          Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
          activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
          single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
          shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
          to one side.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)
           Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

                          NICK FURY
           It's Barton. He took out our systems.
           He's headed for the detention level.
           Does anybody copy?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY

          Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking
          back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her
          coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.

                          NATASHA
           This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
          Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Stark, we're losing altitude.

                          IRON MAN
           Yeah. Noticed.
          The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S
          BOOSTERS get more and more bright.
          On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at
          Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA
          loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto
          a LOOSE CABLE.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,
          escaping.

                          THOR

           NO!
          Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES
          down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki
          dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind
          the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki
          smiles.

                          LOKI
           Are you ever not going to fall for
           that?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,
          Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand
          fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making
          Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJÖLNIR onto the glass cell. To
          his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES
          the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

          SOLDIER.

                          LOKI
           (smiles; walks over to the

                          CONTROL PANEL)
           The humans think us immortal. Should we
           test that?
          Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON
          stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Move away, please.
          Loki moves away from the switch.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You like this? We started working on
           the prototype after you sent THE
           DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it
           does. Do you wanna find out?

          A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

          REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

                          THOR
           Nooo!
          Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps
          down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.
          He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.
          Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

          DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY

          Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
          KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
          her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
          Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
          SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
          LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
          wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
          Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
          LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
          down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

                          BARTON
           Natasha...
          Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

          EXT. SKY

          Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell
          pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,
          but misses. Land draws closer.
          In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto
          the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit
          the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out
          into the meadow.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and
          proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're gonna lose.

                          LOKI

                          (TURNING)
           Am I?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's in your nature.

                          LOKI
           Your heroes are scattered, your
           floating fortress falls from the
           sky...where is my disadvantage?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You lack conviction.

                          LOKI
           I don't think I...

          AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

          CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           So that's what it does.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch
          has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE
          ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS
          itself.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

           Cap, I need the lever!

           STEVE (V.O.)
           I need a minute here!

                          TONY
           Lever. Now!
          Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
          then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
          rotors, getting chewed up.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
          railing.
          BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
          up and finally PULLS the lever.
          A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
          heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
          BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
          wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking
          Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

           Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No. I'm clocked out here.

                          NICK FURY
           Not an option.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's okay, boss. This was never going
           to work... if they didn't have
           something... to...
          Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks
          on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Agent Coulson is down.
          Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on
          her headset, standing up.

           SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)
           Paramedics are on their way.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They're here.

          Steve and Tony listen in as well.

           They called it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ LATER

          Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
          there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
          on their devastated faces.

                          NICK FURY
           These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
           Guess he never did get you to sign
           them.
          Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table
          towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

                          NICK FURY
           We're dead in the air up here. Our
           communications, location of the cube,
           Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
           Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
           coming.

                          (A BEAT)
           Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
           with the Tesseract. I never put all my
           chips on that number though, because I
           was playing something even riskier.
           There was an idea, Stark knows this,
           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
           idea was to bring together a group of
           remarkable people, see if they could
           become something more. See if they
           could work together when we needed them
           to, to fight the battles that we never
           could. Phil Coulson died still
           believing in that idea, in heroes.
          Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

                          NICK FURY
           Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

          EXT. MEADOW ­ DAY

          INT. ABANDONED BUILDING ­ DAY

          Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is
          IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED
          IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,
          amazed.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           You fell out of the sky.

                          (COMING TO)
           Did I hurt anybody?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           There's nobody around here to get hurt.
           You did scare the hell out of some

           Lucky.

                          SECURITY GUARD

           you fell.

                          BANNER
           You saw?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           The whole thing, right through the
           ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
           nude. Here...
          He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           I didn't think those would fit you
           until you shrunk down to a regular size
           fella.

                          BANNER
           Thank you.

                          NATASHA
           Clint, you're gonna be alright.

                          CLINT BARTON
           You know that? Is that what you know? I
           got...I gotta go in though. I gotta
           flush him out.

                          NATASHA
           We don't have that long, it's gonna
           take time.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I don't understand. Have you ever had
           someone take your brain and play? Pull
           you out and send something else in? Do
           you know what it's like to be unmade?

                          NATASHA
          You know that I do.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Why am I back? How did you get him out?

                          NATASHA
          Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
          really hard in the head.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Thanks.
           (Natasha unfastens the

                          RESTRAINTS)
          Tasha, how many agents?

                          NATASHA
          Don't. Don't do that to yourself,
          Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters
          and magic and nothing we were ever
          trained for.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Loki, he got away?

                          NATASHA
          Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

                          CLINT BARTON
          I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
          He's gonna make his play soon though.
          Today.

                          NATASHA
          We gotta stop him.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Yeah? Who's we?

                          NATASHA
          I don't know. Whoever's left.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's
          eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.

                          NATASHA
          Now you sound like you.
          Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.

                          CLINT BARTON
           But you don't. You're a spy, not a
           soldier. Now you want to wade into a
           war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

                          NATASHA
           He didn't, I just...

                          (SHE PAUSES)

                          CLINT BARTON
           Natasha.

                          NATASHA
           I've been compromised. I got red in my
           ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY

          Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a
          word. Steve walks in.

                          STEVE
           Was he married?

                          TONY
           No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

                          STEVE
           I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

                          TONY
           He was an idiot.

                          STEVE
           Why? For believing?

                          TONY
           For taking on Loki alone.

                          STEVE
           He was doing his job.

                          TONY
           He was out of his league. He should
           have waited. He should have...

                          STEVE
          Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

                          TONY

                          (WALKS AWAY)
          Right. How did that work for him?

                          STEVE
          Is this the first time you've lost a
          soldier?

                          TONY
           (turns around sharply)
          WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching
          to Fury's fife!

                          STEVE
          Neither am I! He's got the same blood
          on his hands as Loki does. Right now
          we've got to put that aside and get
          this done. Now Loki needs a power
          source, if we can put together a
          list...

                          TONY
           (looking at the blood stained

                          WALL)
          He made it personal.

                          STEVE
          That's not the point.

                          TONY
          That is the point. That's Loki's point.
          He hit us all right where we live. Why?

                          STEVE
          To tear us apart.

                          TONY
          He had to conquer his greed, but he
          knows he has to take us out to win,
          right? That's what he wants. He wants
          to beat us and he wants to be seen
          doing it. He wants an audience.

                          STEVE
           Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

                          TONY
           Yeah. That's just a preview, this is
           opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.
           He wants flowers, he wants parades, he
           wants a monument built in the skies
           with his name plastered...

                          (PAUSE)
           Sonofabitch!

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig works around the CMS device that has already been set-
          upon the rooftop of Tony's tower.

          INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.

                          STEVE
           Time to go.

                          NATASHA
           Go where?

                          STEVE
           I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly
           one of those jets?
          Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I can.
          Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's
          on their side.

                          STEVE
           You got a suit?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah.

                          STEVE
           Then suit up.

                         MONTAGE
          - KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from
          above, colliding on MJÖLNIR. The explosion is massive. THE

          MIGHTY THOR.
          - CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls on his HELMET and SHIELD.
          - Tony WELDS his IRON MAN helmet. LIGHT slips down over IRON
          MAN's eye holes.
          - BLACK WIDOW attaches a GLOVE GAUNTLET with her rounds on her
          wrist. A BLUE LIGHT CHARGES.
          - HAWKEYE slips on his QUIVER of arrows.

          EXT/INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A
          YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.

           YOUNG SHIELD PILOT
           You are not authorized to be here...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Son... just don't.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill
          walks up to him, knowing.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Hill?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Those cards, they were in Coulson's
           locker, not in his jacket.

                          NICK FURY
           They needed the push.
           (holding Coulson's cards)
          A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying
          off as well as the QUINJET.

                          NICK FURY
           They found it. Get our communications
           back up, whatever you have to do. I
           want eyes on everything.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS
          device, holding the Tesseract.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The
           device is already self-sustained.

                          TONY
           Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

                          SELVIG
           It's too late! It can't stop now. He
           wants to show us something! A new
           universe.

                          IRON MAN
           Okay.
          IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy
          from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls
          backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
          TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                          JARVIS
           The barrier is pure energy. It's
           unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
           to be deployed.

                          TONY
           Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
           clock.
          TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
          him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
          the penthouse.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
          steps, towards the bar.

                          LOKI
           Please tell me you're going to appeal
           to my humanity.

                          TONY
           Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
           you.

                          LOKI
           You should have left your armor on for
           that.

                          TONY
           Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
           You've got the blue stick of destiny.
           Would you like a drink?

                          LOKI
           Stalling me won't change anything.

                          TONY
           No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
           sure? I'm having one.

                          LOKI
           The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
           change that. What have I to fear?

                          TONY

           THE AVENGERS.
           (Loki looks at him, confused)
           It's what we call ourselves, sort of
           like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
           type of thing.

                          LOKI
           Yes, I've met them.

                          TONY

                          (SMILING)
           Yeah, takes us a while to get any
           traction, I'll give you that one.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           But, let's do a head count here. Your
           brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
           a living legend who kind of lives up to
           the legend; a man with breath-taking
           anger management issues; a couple of
           master assassins, and you, big fella,
           you've managed to piss off every single
           one of them.

                          LOKI
           That was the plan.

                          TONY
           Not a great plan. When they come, and
           they will, they'll come for you.
          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
          BRACELETS, a honing device.

                          LOKI
           I have an army.

                          TONY
           We have a HULK.

                          LOKI
           I thought the beast had wandered off.

                          TONY
           You're missing the point. There's no
           throne, there is no version of this,
           where you come out on top. Maybe your
           army comes and maybe it's too much for
           us, but it's all on you. Because if we
           can't protect the Earth, you can be
           damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                          LOKI
           (slowly walks up to him;
           raising the scepter)
           How will your friends have time for
           me,when they're so busy fighting you?
          Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
          Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                          LOKI
           It should work.

                          TONY
           Well, performance issues. You know?
          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
          the room.

                          TONY
           Jarvis. Anytime now.
          Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                          LOKI
           You will all fall before me.
          LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
          From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
          the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                          IRON MAN
           And there's one other person you pissed
           off! His name was Phil.
          Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
          his ass.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
          the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

          ANOTHER PORTAL.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
          out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
          the end.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Right. Army.
          IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
          miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
          JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
          missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
          flies towards the city.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
          the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
          BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

          AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

          BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

          EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
          out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
          Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                          THOR
           Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
           destroy it!

                          LOKI
           You can't. There is no stopping it.
           There is only the war!

                          THOR
           So be it.
          Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
          collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
          and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
          They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
          towards his tower.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Stark, we're heading north east.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          IRON MAN
           What, did you stop for drive-thru?
           Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
           for you.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
          at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
          crash.
          Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
          QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

          CHITAURI.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we have more incoming.

                          TONY
           Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
          IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
          scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           See them.
          HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
          Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          INT. QUINJET ­ DAY

          With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
          seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
          by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
          in hand.

          EXT. FOUR WAY STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
          the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
          With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
          Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
          OVER the TRIO.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
          buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
          begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, are you seeing this?

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I'm seeing, still working on believing.
           Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          TONY
           Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
           soft spot.
          IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
          the city falling to ash.

                          THOR
           Look at this! Look around you! You
           think this madness will end with your
           rule?

                          LOKI
           (tries to look away)
           It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                          THOR
           No. We can. Together.
          Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
          stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                          LOKI
           Sentiment.
          Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
          SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
          looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
          CHITAURI follow his lead.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
          taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

          CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

          IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
          TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
          shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
          bridge.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Those people need assistance down
           there.
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
          them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           We got this. It's good. Go!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (AT HAWKEYE)
           You think you can hold them off?

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain.
           (pulls a trigger on his bow;
           a narrow is mechanically

                          CHOSEN)
           It would be my genuine pleasure.
          HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
          seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
          followed by an EXPLOSION.
          Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
          cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
          HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
          CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
          to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
          People begin to run out.
          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
          ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                          HAWKEYE
           You and I remember Budapest
           verydifferently.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
          pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                          YOUNG COP
           We need to get out! They gotta bring
           the National Guard!

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           National Guard? Does the army know
           what's happening here?

                          YOUNG COP
           Do we?
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
          ridiculous looking man.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I need men in these buildings. There
           are people inside that can run into the
           line of fire. You take them through the
           basement or through the subway. You
           keep them off the streets. I need a
           perimeter as far back as 39th.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           Why the hell should I take orders from
           you?
          Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
          is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
          watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
          Sergeant turns to his officer.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           I need men in those buildings, lead the
           people down and away from the streets.
           I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

          EXT. SKY LINE ­ DAY

          IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
          and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                          IRON MAN

                          (TO JARVIS)
           We got his attention. What the hell is
           step two?!
          IRON MAN flies away.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
          throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
          STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
          WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
          until...
          Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
          firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
          They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What's the story upstairs?

                          THOR
           The powers surrounding the cube is
           impenetrable.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
           guys.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           How do we do this?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           As a team.

                          THOR
           I have unfinished business with Loki.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah, get in line.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
           focused on us and that's what we need.
           Without him these things could run
           wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
           need us...
          Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
          looks around the city.

                          BANNER
           So, this all seems horrible.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I've seen worse.

                          BANNER
           Sorry.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           No. We could use a little worse.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark? We got him.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Just like you said.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
           the party to you.
          IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
          still.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I... I don't see how that's a party...
          IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
          swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
          keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
          Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
           time for you to get angry.

                          BANNER
           That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
           angry.
          Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

          SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
          Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
          IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
          to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT ­ LARGE
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
          withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          raises his SHIELD to block them.
          From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
          horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

          UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

          SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          Loki watches below, motionless.

                          LOKI
           Send the rest.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN

          MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Guys.

                          IRON MAN
           Call it, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Alright, listen up. Until we can close
           that portal up there, we're gonna use
           containment. Barton, I want you on that
           roof, eyes on everything. Call out
           patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
           perimeter. Anything gets more than
           three blocks out, you turn it back or
           your turn it to ash.

                          HAWKEYE
           Wanna give me a lift?

                          IRON MAN
           Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
          IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
           that portal. Slow them down. You've got
           the lightning. Light the bastards up.
           (Thor flies up; to Natasha)
           You and me, we stay here on the ground,
           keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

          THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

          UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

          HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
          THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

          THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

          IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

          MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

          OUT OF ALTITUDE.

          EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ­ DAY

          Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJÖLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
          BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

          MJÖLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

          THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

          IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

          DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
          going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir. The council is on.
          OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
          of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
          AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
          EXPLODING a RIDER.

                          HAWKEYE
           Stark. You got a lot of strings
           sticking to your tail.

                          IRON MAN
           Just try and keep them off the streets.

                          HAWKEYE
           Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
           Find a tight corner.

                          IRON MAN
           I will roger that.
          IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
          HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
          CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
          TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Nice call. What else you got?

           HAWKEYE (V.O.)
           Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down
           on 6th.

                          TONY
           And he didn't invite me?

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
          around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
          another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
          mesmerized by what lies beyond.
          WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY

          Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

          CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

          POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

          WAVE OFF THE HULK.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
          CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
          throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
          there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
           damn thing if we don't close that
           portal.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Well, maybe it's not about guns.
           (gestures the flying

                          CHARIOTS)

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You wanna get up there, you're gonna
           need a ride.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I got a ride. I could use a lift
           though.
          BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
          and angles his SHIELD.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are you sure about this?

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

          BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

          MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

          SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

          FLYING CHARIOT.
          [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
          one extended shot.]
          - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
          shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
          her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
          building.
          - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
          following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
          fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
          BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
          a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
          - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
          one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

          IRON MAN.
          - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

          BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
          SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

          THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS

          IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--

          INT. HISTORY MUSEUM ­ DAY

          The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR
          and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after
          bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR

          WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,
          confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
          FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
          SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap
          BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,
           they caught a lot of civilians there.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm on it.

          INT. 42NDBANK ­ DAY

          Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
          uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
          pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

          BEEPS.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
          at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
          rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
          them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
          BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
          A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
          HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Everyone! Clear out!
          CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
          just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
          trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
          through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
          look up from below. They're okay.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE BANK ­ CONTINUOUS

          Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
          police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.
          A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD

          SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           Director Fury, the council has made a
           decision.

                          NICK FURY
           I recognize the council has made a
           decision, but given that it's a stupid
           ass decision, I've elected to ignore
           it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Director, you're closer than any of
           oursubs, you scramble that jet...

                          NICK FURY
           That is the island of Manhattan,
           Councilman. Until I'm certain my team
           can't hold it, I will not order a
           nuclear strike against a civilian
           population.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           If we don't hold them in the air, we
           lose everything.

                          NICK FURY
           I send that bird out, we already have.
          Fury shuts off his viewscreen.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at
          her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was
          she looks behind.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Oh. You.
          LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing
          between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.

                          HAWKEYE
           Nat, what are you doing?

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Uh... a little help!
          HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it
          at Loki, smiling.

                          HAWKEYE
           I've got him.

          FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S

          HEAD...

          SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

          AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

          BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

          THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.
          BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of
          the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the
          edge.

          EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE ­ DAY

          As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
          LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
          COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
          attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

          STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

                          LOKI

           ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

           ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

           I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

          HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR

          REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

          FLATTENING LOKI.

                          HULK

           PUNY GOD.

          LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
          weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
          firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the sky.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Doctor.

                          SELVIG
           Loki's scepter, the energy...the
           Tesseract can't fight. You can't
           protect against yourself.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           It's not your fault. You didn't know
           what you were doing.

                          SELVIG
           Well, actually I think I did. I built
           in a safety to cut the power source.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Loki's scepter.

                          SELVIG
           It might be able to close the portal.
           (Selvig looks down. He sees a

                          GOLD GLEAM)
           And I'm looking right at it.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
          hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
          through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
          off SOLDIERS.
          IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
          LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we will lose power before you cut
           through that shell.
          IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.

                          IRON MAN
           JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of
           Jonah?

                          JARVIS
           I wouldn't consider him a role model.

          IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
          ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
          IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
          wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
          sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
          holding out their rifles.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING ­ DAY

          HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,
          he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
          off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
          GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
          HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
          and CANNONBALLS in.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them
          down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
          OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES

          THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM

          OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY

          A lone pilot sits in his cockpit, listening.

          Back in the bridge, Agent Hill sees on her SCREEN 7 ALPHA 11
          preparing to leave.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone
           on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We
           need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off
           is not authorized!

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK ­ DAY


          NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-
          7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The
          jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.
          Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,
          knowing he can't do anything about it.

                          NICK FURY
           Stark, you hearing me? We have a
           missile headed straight for the city.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           How long?

                          NICK FURY
           Three minutes, at best. Stay low and
           wipe out the missile.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.

                          IRON MAN
           Jarvis, put everything we got into the
           thrusters!

                          JARVIS
           I just did.
          IRON MAN leaves the streets and flies up into the sky.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          7 ALPHA 11 arrives outside the city. He flips the switch to
          press the button. He presses it. THE MISSILE IS FLYING OUT TO

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both
          throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJÖLNIR, but as Cap
          turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to
          a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over
          on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises
          his SHIELD back up.

                          THOR
           You ready for another bout?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Selvig, back in scientist mode, CLACKS away at his laptop.
          Henods. BLACK WIDOW grabs Loki's scepter, slowly breaks into the
          FORCE FIELD, almost touching the Tesseract.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I
           can shut the portal down!

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Do it!

           No, wait!

           where to put it.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The
          missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it
          tightly.
          With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.
          Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight
          up into sky, towards the portal.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?

          PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the
          destruction in NEW YORK. On the table, her cell is VIBRATING,
          with Tony's picture on it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as
          they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.

          EXT. SKY ­ DAY

          IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
          suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
          The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
          with Tony. NOTHING.

          EXT. SPACE

          We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
          with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
          hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
          IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
          blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
          The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
          causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
          spectacular heavenly display.

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
          KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE
          AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it
          through.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,
          waiting.

           Come on, Stark...

          EXT. MANHATTAN ­ DAY

          Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to
          Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           (to BLACK WIDOW)
           Close it.

          EXT. STARK TOWER ­ DAY

          Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
          TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.
          A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed
          portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.

                          THOR
           He's not slowing down.
          Thor swings Mjölnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK

          SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A

          BUILDING.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET ­ DAY

          HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor
          RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around
          not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES

          TONY AWAKE.

                          TONY
           What the hell? What just happened?
           Please tell me nobody kissed me?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (A BEAT)
           We won.

                          TONY
           Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys.
           Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's
           just take a day. Have you ever tried
           shawarma? There's a shawarma joint
           about two blocks from here. I don't
           know what it is, but I wanna try it.

                          THOR
           (looking up at Stark Tower)
           We're not finished yet.
          A beat.

                          TONY
           And then shawarma after.

          Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag
          doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He
          turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.

                          LOKI
           If it's all the same to you. I'll have
           that drink.

          THE HULK SNORTS AT HIM.

          WEEKS LATER.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of
          what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,
          protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.

           OLD MAN (STAN LEE)
           Superheroes? In New York? Give me a
           break!

                          SENATOR BOYNTON
           These so called heroes have to be held
           responsible for the destruction done to
           the city. This was their fight. Where
           are they now?

                          WAITRESS
           What? That this was somehow their
           fault? Captain America saved my life.
           Wherever he is, wherever any of them
           are, I just wanna say thank you.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK ­ DAY

          The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,
          to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives
          Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
          Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
          Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
          The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
          Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
          different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
          sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
          climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM ­ DAY

          Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #3
           Where are the Avengers?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not currently tracking their
           whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a
           leave of absence.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           And the Tesseract?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is where it belongs: out
           of our reach.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           That's not your call.

                          NICK FURY
           I didn't make it. I just didn't argue
           with the god that did.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           So you let him take it and the war
           criminal, Loki, who should be answering
           for his crimes?

                          NICK FURY
           Oh, I think he will be.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           I don't think you understand what
           you've started. Letting the Avengers
           loose on this world. They're dangerous.

                          NICK FURY
           They surely are. And the whole world
           knows it. Every world knows it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Was that the point of all this? A
           statement?

                          NICK FURY
           A promise.

          Fury walks out, towards the bridge.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out
          into the world.

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, how does it work now? They've gone
           their separate ways, some pretty
           extremely far. We get into a situation
           like this again, what happens then?

                          NICK FURY
           They'll come back.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           You really sure about that?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Why?

                          NICK FURY
           Because we'll need them to.

          Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - STORAGE ROOM - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               Darkness. Then the GLINT of a flashlight. Its beam rocks 
               crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room 
               as we hear two children arguing.

                                     OLDER KID
                         You're doing it wrong.

                                     YOUNGER KID
                         Shut up.

                                     OLDER KID
                         You're doing it wrong.

               It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping 
               beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef 
               on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African 
               masks.

               Beneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle 
               into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their 
               pajamas.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It doesn't go like that.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who asked you?

                                     STEPHEN
                         If you do it like that it'll open in 
                         the fire. Then you'll get burned and 
                         DIE.

               The door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. It's a 
               fire station storage room full of fire gear. A fireman stands 
               in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; DENNIS 
               McCAFFREY.

                                     DENNIS
                         Who's going to die?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. 
                         He never does it right.

                                     DENNIS
                              (gestures for them to 
                              come out)
                         Well, let's have a look.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY

               The two boys tromp out of the closet. The rubber turn-out 
               boots are as high as their thighs. The ends of the coats 
               drag on the floor. They salute, Brian's arm just an empty 
               sleeve. Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat.

                                     DENNIS
                         Your brother's right. If you don't 
                         fasten these correctly they could 
                         open and you'd get burned.

                                     STEPHEN
                         And DIE!

                                     BRIAN
                         You wouldn't let me die, would you, 
                         Dad?

                                     DENNIS
                         McCaffreys are smarter than fire, 
                         Brian.
                              (playfully slaps their 
                              shoulders)
                         How 'bout lunch, huh?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fireman shit?

                                     DENNIS
                         Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd 
                         you grow up, a barn?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Firehouse.

                                     DENNIS
                         Cute.

               -- The station suddenly fills with the BELLOW of an ALARM 
               KLAXON.

                                     DENNIS
                              (sighs)
                         Never fails...

               A young fireman, ADCOX, appears with the dispatch card.

                                     DENNIS
                         Big deal?

                                     AXE
                         Medium deal.

                                     DENNIS
                         Want to come along, Brian? Watch the 
                         old man earn his keep?

                                     STEPHEN
                              (pissed)
                         Dad!

                                     DENNIS
                         You've come along a dozen times, 
                         Stephen, give your brother a chance. 
                         We'll be back in a few minutes.
                              (to Brian)
                         How 'bout it, sport?

                                     BRIAN
                         Sure!

               Dennis scoops Brian up and loads him into the fire engine 
               cab. The other three firemen climb aboard and take their 
               places.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY

               There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine 
               is pulling out of the station.

                                     DENNIS
                         Hit the button, Brian.

               Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light 
               snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down 
               the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last 
               instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older 
               brother.

               They stick their tongues out.

               EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched 
               between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at 
               intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on 
               sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency 
               lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.

               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block. 
               Medium deal. The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping 
               off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and 
               pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his 
               son.

                                     DENNIS
                         Stay near the truck.
                              (winks)
                         And keep an eye out for us, huh? 
                         We're short handed today.

               Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis 
               smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward 
               a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the 
               cab.

                                     ENGINEER
                         Don't stray too far, little man.

               Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better 
               look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking 
               on purpose.

               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER

               There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian 
               watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox 
               onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window 
               over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.

               Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed 
               with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony. 
               A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out 
               the frame with his axe, and dives in.

               A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, 
               smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing 
               to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a 
               ladder.

               Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than 
               life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between 
               fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling 
               darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, 
               he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing 
               a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. 
               The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, 
               don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head 
               staring up in astonishment.

               Nobody else has noticed it.

               Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; 
               probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian 
               starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,

                                     BRIAN
                         Dad...

               He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is 
               happening very fast in slow motion:

               -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole 
               as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that 
               beckons him as -- 

               Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him 
               clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling 
               fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT 
               and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm 
               that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood, 
               and something metal that cracks against the pavement and 
               spins slowly.

               A fire helmet.

               And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, 
               hopeless tears streaming down his face.

                                     AXE
                         Get us some backup! We need some 
                         goddamn backup!

               And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet 
               spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is 
               raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to 
               its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at 
               the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we 
               read the printing on the neck guard.

               MCCAFFREY

               And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, 
               protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian 
               doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his 
               father's helmet, And puts it on.

               The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures 
               the instant.

               INT. SEEDY APARTMENT - DAY

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY

               Hold on the freeze-frame. Let it become an aged cover of 
               LIFE. The magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's 
               sitting atop a box of knick-knacks jostling in the back seat 
               of an aging BMW. There's plenty of other boxes here, a live 
               on the move, and in the driver's seat, BRIAN McCAFFREY, now 
               27. There's piles of empty burger wrappers, Coke cans, and 
               Florida knick-knacks on the dash board; a little blow-up 
               palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with "McCaffrey 
               High-End Stereo Sales".

               EXT. HIGHWAY - MONTAGE - DAY

               Brian and his battered BMW shoot past prairie, cow country, 
               nervous suburbs and finally a sign: WELCOME TO CHICAGO.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Wind tugging at his bangs, Brian stares down at the graves 
               of Dennis and Mary Elizabeth McCaffrey.

               INT. CHICAGO GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY

               In a crusty sink he combs his hair, knots a tie around his 
               neck.

               EXT. CHICAGO FIRE DEPARTMENT TRAINING ACADEMY - DAY

               Brian walks through its sculpted columns, straightening his 
               tie. He comes to a door, FIRE ACADEMY CHIEF. He takes a deep 
               breath, steadies his gaze, and enters.

               INT. FIRE ACADEMY CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY

               The ACADEMY CHIEF sits at his desk going over a file. Out 
               the window can be heard a FIRE TRAINING CLASS in action.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         Is this a joke?

               Brian's sitting in the seat opposite.

                                     BRIAN
                         If it was a joke, sir, you'd be 
                         laughing.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         You walked out on this academy six 
                         years ago. One week to graduation. 
                         You think we forgot that? You think 
                         I did?

                                     BRIAN
                         I want another shot, Sir.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                              (beat)
                         Look, everybody remembers your old 
                         man. Being his son, all you had to 
                         do was breathe to graduate here. 
                         Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew 
                         us off. Why should I take you back?

                                     BRIAN
                         If you remember, sir, my test scores 
                         were in the top --

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         -- I don't give a damn what your 
                         test scores were, maybe you could 
                         have been a good firemen, but you 
                         had your shot.

                                     BRIAN
                         I need another one, sir.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                         Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try 
                         again next year.

                                     BRIAN
                         No, it isn't out of your hands or 
                         you wouldn't even have met me. If I 
                         push you have to let me back in. 
                         Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                              (simmers)
                         Even if you graduate this academy, 
                         you've still got nine months of 
                         probation. That's hard duty, son. If 
                         you don't really love this job, it'll 
                         kill you.

                                     BRIAN
                              (rises)
                         See you Monday. Sir.

               As we hear the BLOW OF A WHISTLE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CHICAGO FIRE DEPT. TRAINING ACADEMY - GRADUATION DAY

               And everybody lined up at attention in dress blues.

                                     CHIEF FITZGERALD
                              (at podium)
                         Though the world changes every day, 
                         some things are truly forever: 
                         Courage, devotion, and honor in what 
                         we do. This class is a special one, 
                         for we dedicate it to the three 
                         firefighters that have fallen this 
                         year: Donald Knowlton, Richard Walter 
                         and Michael Petzold...
                              (silent beat)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, it is with 
                         pleasure that I certify that Candidate 
                         Class number 322, having successfully 
                         completed all academy requirements, 
                         are hereby graduated to the Chicago 
                         Fire Department.

               Candidates and their relatives CHEER and leap to their feet. 
               Something struggles inside of Brian. He doesn't stand at 
               first. Another Candidate, TIM, 20, looks at him strangely. 
               So does the Academy Chief, his eyes finding Brian's. And 
               Brian's standing slowly now, joining them...

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               An expensive one. We hear a window BREAK.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Through the dimness a file cabinet. An AXE SUDDENLY SLAMS 
               into it, RIPPING it apart. Files crash to the floor. And a 
               picture. 1970. Four young guys marlin fishing. Time of their 
               lives.

               INT. BROWNSTONE BEDROOM - NIGHT

               And a GREY PUTTY being SLAPPED along the edges of a door.

               INT. PUB - NIGHT

               A split-level firemen's dive; complete with mounted axes and 
               personalized T-shirts from various engine companies proudly 
               declaring "LADDER CO. 6 -- AXE FIRST, HOSE LATER" and "CHICAGO 
               FD, 150 YEARS OF TRADITION UNIMPEDED BY PROGRESS".

               Tonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of 
               recently graduated candidates. A few on the back patio have 
               hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at 
               balloon targets, each other, the neighbor's cat. Brian and 
               Tim, still in their uniforms, enter from the street. Survey 
               the scene.

                                     BRIAN
                         Completely out of control.

                                     TIM
                         What the hell are we waiting for?

               As they shoulder their way inside, another CANDIDATE appears 
               holding proudly a fistful of sealed envelopes.

                                     CANDIDATE
                         Hot off the presses, guys. Station 
                         assignments.

               Tim and everyone else but Brian eagerly tear into them. Brian 
               nonchalantly shoulders up to the bar.

                                     BRIAN
                         A beer, Willy!

               The barkeep turns and smiles.

                                     WILLY
                         Well, if it isn't the littlest 
                         McCaffrey.
                              (to candidates with 
                              hose)
                         Hey! You break anything with that 
                         you buy it!
                              (to Brian)
                         Sorry, there must be something wrong 
                         with my eyes. I keep thinking that's 
                         a fire department uniform.

                                     BRIAN
                         It's in my blood, Willy.

               The candidates are ripping open their assignments, exclaiming 
               to each other: "All right! Engine 117! That's a slum! They 
               get cookers every day!". "Oh no, Engine 10, that's a nice 
               neighborhood"...

               Willy turns to the bulletin board behind him and unpins a 
               stack of business cards.

                                     WILLY
                         Really. Well, let's have a look at 
                         what else was "in your blood". I 
                         always look forward to getting these, 
                         they make such a nice collage for 
                         the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, 
                         Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."

                                     BRIAN
                         Didn't offer the kinda growth and 
                         challenge I need.

                                     WILLY
                         Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile 
                         Log Cabins". That was in your blood 
                         about six months wasn't it?

                                     BRIAN
                         Management were pin heads.

                                     WILLY
                         "Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?

                         Coffee sucked.

                         And just this year, "Brian's Sound 
                         Spectrum". Your own company even. 
                         Big step.

                                     BRIAN
                         I was ahead of my time.

                                     WILLY
                         You know, I've got a perfect little 
                         spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, 
                         Fireman"...

               Tim holds an envelope marked McCAFFREY out to Brian.

                                     TIM
                         Aren't you even curious?

                                     BRIAN
                         Engine 115, right?

                                     TIM
                              (opens it, surprised)
                         How'd you know? These are supposed 
                         to be sealed.

                                     BRIAN
                         Lucky guess.
                              (winks)
                         And a case of scotch to a captain in 
                         station assignments.

                                     TIM
                         You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?

                                     BRIAN
                         Lots of fires. They promote faster 
                         there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s 
                         list, half the guys on it came from 
                         that battalion. Gotta think about 
                         your future, Timmy. 115's the station.

                                     TIM
                         Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your 
                         way into a station, why not 17 with 
                         me and your brother?

               On Brian's reaction

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A Porsche knifes through darkened streets. The DRIVER, 50, 
               is dressed for success. Pulling up to the brownstone we saw 
               earlier, he gets out and rubs his eyes. Another day in the 
               salt mines.

               Climbing the short stairs, he sticks his key into the lock 
               and opens the door. It is the last thing he will ever do.

               A THUNDERING EXPLOSION ENGULFS the stoop.

               INT. PUB - NIGHT

               The place is packed now with girls flirting with the 
               candidates, putting their helmets on, etc. The horseplay 
               around the bar suddenly stops at the sweet sound of a SIREN.

               EXT. PUB - NIGHT

               Everyone steps outside, cocks an ear. And here it comes, the 
               real thing, SCREECHING past in a full-tilt rush. Shouts and 
               raised toasts.

                                     TIM
                         Hey, that's my cousin's company! 
                         C'mon! Let's go!

               As Brian turns, he suddenly confronted by an elderly 
               LITHUANIAN WOMAN.

                                     BRIAN
                              (surprised)
                         Mrs. Viatkus...

               She grabs his cheeks and rattles off in Lithuanian. Brian 
               can only smile. Then two attractive jean-clad legs step up. 
               JENNIFER.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                              (surprised)
                         Jennifer.

                                     JENNIFER
                         You're back.

                                     BRIAN
                         You look great.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Thanks for calling.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low 
                         profile... the academy... I graduated 
                         today.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Huh.

                                     BRIAN
                         So... I see you're still in the 
                         neighborhood.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Not quite. Just visiting. I live in 
                         Lincoln Park now.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? What have you been up to?

                                     JENNIFER
                         I work for city hall.

                                     BRIAN
                         Really? No kidding.

                                     JENNIFER
                         What, you think I just dried up and 
                         blew away when you left? The world 
                         does turn once in awhile Brian, even 
                         without your permission.

               Just then, Tim OPENS UP the hoseline, DRENCHING Brian.

                                     TIM
                         Don't want you overheating, Brian!

               Brian ducks the stream and PULLS a length of hose near his 
               feet, FLIPPING Tim. Brian JUMPS him, shuts off the hose and 
               pins him to the pavement.

                                     TIM
                         Okay okay! Uncle!

               Brian walks back toward Jennifer

                                     JENNIFER
                         You've certainly matured.

               She turns to leave.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, if nothing else, it's nice to 
                         know we can still be friends.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I don't want to be your friend, Brian.

               Another in a series of fire engines HOWL past. Tim grabs 
               Brian by the shoulder.

                                     TIM
                         Let's go, man!

               EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

               Brian and Tim jump into Brian's car. They shoot blindly down 
               the street looking for the fire engine, running down red 
               lights or anything else that gets in their way. Brian suddenly 
               hits the brakes, SCREECHING to a stop. They roll down their 
               windows. Far off can be heard the wind-up of a siren.

                                     TIM
                              (points)
                         That way.

               EXT. STREETS - FIRE ENGINE - NIGHT

               SCREECH. They fly around a corner, down a block, and there 
               it is, lights flashing up ahead. Brian GUNS it, roars up 
               alongside the fire engine. Tim leans out the window, shakes 
               a bottle of beer, and lets loose a foamy eruption in the 
               truck driver's face.

                                     DRIVER
                         Tim! You crazy motherfucker!

               But he's laughing.

                                     TIM
                         What'cha got?

                                     DRIVER
                         Box alarm. Walton Ave.

                                     TIM
                         We'll meet ya.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - WALTON AVENUE - NIGHT

               As Brian and Tim pull up two engine companies are already 
               dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode 
               earlier. Tim cheers the firemen on like a drive-in movie.

               Brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. Embers 
               whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him.

               One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He 
               watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person 
               would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian 
               turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are 
               gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian 
               notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice 
               the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield. 
               It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy 
               angles. A dog barks furiously at it.

                                     TIM
                              (also looking at body)
                         Man. Something sure put a crimp in 
                         his evening.

                                     BRIAN
                         Backdraft.

               The brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy 
               clouds of dirty white steam. And one of the firemen is coming 
               back out now, walking toward Brian.

               When he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask 
               and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a 
               dead ringer for HIS FATHER.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Well, look what we have here. Nice 
                         costume. Rent it?

                                     BRIAN
                         I want to thank you for coming to my 
                         graduation, Stephen. It was a great 
                         inspiration to me.

                                     STEPHEN
                         So you're going to fight fires now, 
                         huh?

               He pats Brian's cheeks, leaving behind large charcoal smears.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (re smears)
                         Doesn't work on you.
                              (turns to leave)
                         See ya around, little brother.

                                     BRIAN
                         Not likely.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (turns)
                         Well, see you're wrong already. Had 
                         a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we 
                         decided in the interest of brotherly 
                         love, that maybe you shouldn't be 
                         way over on the other side of town. 
                         So starting tomorrow, your assigned 
                         to company 17. My company.
                              (Brian's color drops 
                              a hue)
                         One case of scotch, you're getting 
                         cheap in your old age, Brian...

               And Stephen turns for his own men, Tim staring at Brian as 
               clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

               A flame LEAPS up into the foreground. Touches a cigarette. 
               The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the 
               mouth of RIMGALE, fifty-five years old and six and a half 
               feet of solid granite. Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks 
               tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another 
               slow drag. Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield. 
               It's twenty yards away from the brownstone. Stephen looks up 
               as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot, 
               and crosses the street to the building.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Charred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness. Rimgale 
               is there, gloomy in the beam of his flashlight. He crouches 
               down, plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard.

                                     SHADOW
                         If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll 
                         start charging you admission.

               Stephen is leaning in the doorway, watching him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Got a cause?

                                     SHADOW
                         Are the glory boys actually showing 
                         interest in Investigation's work? I 
                         may have a stroke.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The glory boys just want to finish 
                         their report so they can go home.

               Rimgale's flashlight finds a wall socket that he pries loose 
               and holds up to the light. He lowers it, takes in the walls, 
               the room.

                                     SHADOW
                         They're gonna have to wait a few 
                         days on this one.

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Tim's talking to his cousin. Brian hangs back, watches the 
               body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon. 
               There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs 
               circling and barking. Brian walks up, looks inside the car, 
               and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a FINGER.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to coroner crew)
                         Hey, you forgot... this.

               They're already climbing into the wagon. The driver smiles 
               creepily.

                                     CORONER DRIVER
                         We always leave something for the 
                         dogs.

               Brian looks across the fireground, sees his brother walking 
               back to the fire engine. They share a brief, edgy glance.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               A modest one. South-side Irish old fashioned. Brian walks 
               up. There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy 
               fire truck on the drive.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, Sean. What's goin' on, man?

               The kid stares at him without a glimmer of recognition.

                                     BRIAN
                         It's Uncle Brian. Y'know.

               He makes his hand into a talking puppet.

                                     BRIAN
                              (bandito accent)
                         "Spinach? We don't need no stinking 
                         spinach". Remember?

               The kid drops his toy truck and flees inside.

                                     KID
                         Mom! Mom!

               INT. HELEN'S HOUSE

               Brian follows, sticks his head in the door.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hellooo...

               A warm looking woman, 30's, HELEN, comes around the corner.

                                     HELEN
                         Brian?

                                     BRIAN
                         Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.

                                     HELEN
                         You look like... Brian.

               She gives him a tentative hug.

                                     HELEN
                         'Bout written you off. How long have 
                         you been in town?

                                     BRIAN
                         Four months.

                                     HELEN
                         Four months?

                                     BRIAN
                         I know, I know, Should'a called. 
                         I've been really busy. I joined the 
                         fire department.

               Helen's expression suddenly saddens.

                                     HELEN
                         Oh Brian...
                              (beat)
                         You guys... you really know how to 
                         put each other through it, don't 
                         you?

               The little kid is peeking fearfully from the kitchen doorway.

                                     BRIAN
                         That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.

                                     HELEN
                         Yeah, you'd be surprised what three 
                         years can do to a kid.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sean, come on out, man. What, you 
                         forget your favorite uncle?

                                     HELEN
                         Stephen told him you were killed in 
                         a hot tub accident.

                                     SEAN
                              (intense)
                         Dad was kidding, Mom.

               And the kid runs unexpectedly away, angry.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well that's two things to strangle 
                         Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?

                                     HELEN
                              (beat)
                         Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. 
                         He moved out last April.

               An embarrassed sting.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, man, I'm sorry.

                                     HELEN
                         You guys ought to try picking up a 
                         phone once in awhile.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - MARINA - DAY

               A small one on the river. Several boats bob peacefully. Except 
               one. Raised high in dry-dock, it's an ancient fishing trawler. 
               Bachman-Turner-Overdrive drifts up from the galley on badly 
               fuzzed speakers as Brian climbs the ladder.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey.

               Stripped to the waist, Stephen's bent-over cleaning out the 
               guts of the inboard motor. He looks confused to see Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         I talked to Helen...

               Wrong thing to say. Stephen turns back to his work.

                                     BRIAN
                         ...Man, I thought dad's boat was 
                         finally retired to the family 
                         graveyard. Don't you worry about 
                         falling out of this thing?

               Stephen straightens up, his forearms smudged with grease. 
               Brian admires the unwashed cereal bowls and peeling deck 
               paint.

                                     BRIAN
                         I like what you've done with the 
                         place.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It's comin' along... want a beer?

               Stephen tosses him a beer from the fridge. As Brian pops it, 
               he sees the small pile of city-issue gallon size cans in the 
               corner. Armorall, solvent, extinguisher foam.

                                     BRIAN
                         Been ripping off fire stations?

                                     STEPHEN
                         It's old stuff Adcox gave me that 
                         the department was going to throw 
                         out anyway. Still good enough though 
                         for this tub.

               Brian winces at the music coming out of shot speakers.

                                     BRIAN
                         Bachman Turner Overdrive?
                              (looks through music 
                              rack)
                         ...Buffalo Springfield?... Stephen 
                         Bishop? Oh man...

               Brian lifts one of the tapes -- an 8-track -- and holds it 
               carefully in his palm as if it were a rare and fragile relic.

                                     BRIAN
                         My God, an actual operating 8-track.

                                     STEPHEN
                         What, you've never seen one before?

                                     BRIAN
                         In the Field Museum once.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It works.

                                     BRIAN
                         It worked when you were in sixth 
                         grade.

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY

               Brian opens the trunk of his old BMW. It's full of stereo 
               boxes marked BRIAN'S "SOUND SPECTRUM".

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - CABIN - DAY

               Brian's gutted the speakers and is re-wiring them.

                                     STEPHEN
                         People actually used to pay you for 
                         this?

                                     BRIAN
                         Millions, Stephen -- And sexual 
                         favors.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Sheep don't count.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? What about Laura --

                                     STEPHEN
                         That was never proved.

               Brian moves over to another speaker.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Why'd you come here, Brian?

                                     BRIAN
                         I wanted to know why you messed with 
                         my station assignment. I mean, is 
                         this really gonna have to one of 
                         those big brother -- little brother 
                         "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still 
                         pissed" games?

                                     STEPHEN
                              (sighs)
                         What is it with you, man, huh? How 
                         do you manage to keep coming up with 
                         new and amazing ways to screw up? 
                         That scotch bullshit? Am I really 
                         supposed to believe you came crawling 
                         back home because you suddenly felt 
                         heart strings moan for the family 
                         biz? You were bankrupt, man.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey! You don't know me --

                                     STEPHEN
                         I know you cold, Brian. The scary 
                         thing is, you probably could have 
                         faked it for awhile. But you see, in 
                         this job there's no place to hide. 
                         Isn't like selling log cabins. You 
                         have a bad day here -- someone dies. 
                         And that's not fucking good enough. 
                         Want another beer?

                                     BRIAN
                         So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna 
                         ride my ass till I cough blood?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Big bad brother is going to treat 
                         you like any other probie -- that I 
                         don't think is going to make it.

               Brian staples the last of the audio cord in place and switches 
               on the tape player. The cabin fills with sharp, crystal clear --
               Stephen Bishop.

                                     BRIAN
                         There's only so much technology can 
                         do.
                              (picks up his tool 
                              box)
                         Thanks for the beer.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Thanks for the speakers.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - DAY

               Brian climbs down off the boat. Looks up at Stephen.

                                     BRIAN
                         Y'know, I told myself a million times 
                         I didn't want to be a fireman. I 
                         said bullshit to that line about 
                         tradition and family legacy. I know 
                         I split, and I know how you felt...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah, you know. You know what it 
                         felt like.

                                     BRIAN
                         I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta 
                         know.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I think you're gonna find out, Brian. 
                         Don't be late tomorrow.

               INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING

               A simple one-room walk-up. A stereo blares Chicago blues as 
               Brian buttons up his uniform in the mirror. He steps back, 
               looks at himself, -- and oh man what the hell am I doing...

               EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - STREET - MORNING

               Brian climbs into his car, turns the key -- nothing. He gets 
               out, looks under the hood, then SLAMS it down in frustration.

               INT. ELEVATED TRAIN - MORNING

               A pissed-off Chicago, hauling itself off to work in the 
               morning snap, passes by Brian's window. Tough Midwestern 
               brick. Tough Midwesterners. Heads-down in their 150 year war 
               with a wind committed to pushing the whole damn thing into 
               Lake Michigan.

               EXT. EL STATION - MORNING

               The train clacking away above him, Brian walks down the 
               sidewalk carrying his fire equipment. He turns a corner and 
               comes on.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - MORNING

               Brian stands there. It's his dad's station. Turn of the 
               century abused. Sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of 
               faded red doors that suddenly CRANK OPEN as Brian comes up 
               the drive. Fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights 
               flashing, pull out onto the apron.

               The fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is 
               Stephen. One look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we 
               know this isn't Fireman McCaffrey but Fire LT. McCaffrey.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're too late, probie.

               Tim, in ladder truck 46, waves a small bye-bye as both rigs 
               begin heading down the street.

                                     BRIAN
                              (chasing)
                         Goddamn it, Stephen...

               Brian bolts full-out for the engine. At the last instant 
               before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags 
               him aboard.

               INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE 17 - DAY

               It's Adcox, the fireman from the first scene, now a veteran.

                                     AXE
                         Why baby McCaffrey, how ya doin'?

               The Pumper driver, SCHMIDT, pops in a howling ROCK TUNE as 
               they zoom off.

                                     SCHMIDT
                              (re Brian to Adcox)
                         You know this rug rat?

                                     AXE
                         Know him? I practically raised him.
                              (Jewish mom)
                         And he never calls, he never writes...

               Brian shouts over the noise to GRINDLE, 35, one more seat 
               down.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm Brian.

                                     GRINDLE
                         I'm sorry.

               Grindle sticks his nose out the window, sniffs, then begins 
               buckling up his coat.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Boys, I do believe we have a 
                         barbecue...

               As Brian and Adcox fasten up their own equipment --

               EXT. FACTORY - DAY

               Smoke pours with confused indecision from every window of a 
               five story factory as the pumper and ladder company pull up.

                                     GRINDLE
                              (staring at confusing 
                              smoke)
                         I hate it when we gotta fucking go 
                         look for it.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Schmidt)
                         Call in another alarm. We're gonna 
                         need some back-up.

               Everyone begins strapping on air tanks and masks. Adcox drags 
               the rig's suction line to the hydrant. A beautiful illegally 
               parked Mercedes is blocking the way.

                                     AXE
                              (to Stephen)
                         Oh these moments do try me...

                                     STEPHEN
                              (admiring car)
                         Be gentle.

               Whistling to himself, Adcox SMASHES the brass coupling through 
               the passenger window, runs the line through and SMASHES it 
               out the other window before connecting up to the hydrant.

               Stephen and Grindle pull hose off the bed and move out. 
               Brian's so jacked up he can't get his air tank on right. 
               Schmidt calmly helps him into his gear.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         It's only rock 'n roll, kid.

               Stephen, Adcox and Grindle are crouched at the door, ready 
               to go. Brian takes a hose roll and runs to catch up when 
               he's cut-off by dazed Latin workers shouting incoherently at 
               him in SPANISH.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, probie! How 'bout it, huh?

               Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the 
               hose line. Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air 
               tank strap.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're doing it wrong.

               Stephen eases the door open. Thick smoke rolls sickly out 
               over their heads.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Brian)
                         Stay beside me.

               And in they go...

               INT. BURNING FACTORY - DAY

               Inside the smoke is like liquid lead. Going by feel, they 
               hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on 
               their hands and knees toward a dull red glow. Turning a 
               corner, they enter

               INT. BURNING FACTORY - A VAST ROOM - DAY

               Totally ablaze. Brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting 
               waves of flame in the ceiling, at the SCREECHING timbers 
               crumbling to the white-hot floor. At the walls HOWLING in 
               bestial agony. It is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing 
               he has ever seen.

                                     AXE
                         Wash it to the windows?

                                     STEPHEN
                         No, we'll hit the son of a bitch 
                         head on.

                                     AXE
                         It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta 
                         get behind it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. 
                         It'll just steam on us. It won't 
                         flash. Go high in the ceiling.

               Adcox and Grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, 
               expecting the worst. Adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose 
               a high pressure BLAST OF WATER into the ceiling. The fire 
               SCREAMS in manic anger and HEAVES a cloud of HOWLING steam 
               that WHIRLS back and BAKES them like lobsters. Brian gasps 
               for air as swirling ash batters his facemask. A window 
               somewhere EXPLODES. Somebody shouts. Christ, you can't see 
               anything. Stephen HOOPS in victory.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to fire)
                         I knew you were a pussy! C'mon! Steam 
                         us!
                              (to firemen)
                         Let's go!

               The chase is on! Going for the throat while the fire's 
               confused and defensive, the firemen SCRAMBLE through the 
               boiling cloud. They hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, 
               forcing it back and back. It HOWLS and CLAWS in anger, 
               furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces. 
               The walls ECHO with its SCREAMS as it retreats to a corner.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Ya love it, probie?

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm in heaven, Lt.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hook us up to a stand-pipe.

               Brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the 
               building water system. He goes to unscrew the cap with his 
               hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jesus, how 'bout man, huh? We're 
                         gonna loose this!

               Brian finally gets it hooked up and runs back.

               EXT. FACTORY - OTHER SIDE - DAY

               Tim and three guys from his ladder company, come up an 
               extended aerial ladder, CRASH through a window and

               INT. FACTORY - DAY

               begin HACKING their way toward Brian's company as -- BOOM! 
               It's a sudden, shattering vibration that shakes the building 
               to its foundations. Then, a sucking sound: RUSH-RUSH-RUSH... 
               Stephen speaks calmly into his radio handset.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey Otis, is it...?

                                     SCHMIDT
                              (into radio)
                         Yeah.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Goddamn it, where's our backup? 
                         Where's the second-in companies?

                                     SCHMIDT'S VOICE
                         Sorry, man. John Wayne time.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to firemen)
                         Dig in!

               The firemen hesitate. PENGELLY, the Truck Company Lt., looks 
               at Stephen with concern.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Dig in, goddamn it!

               The crews immediately gather in the center of the floor. 
               They turn over tables, chairs, anything to form a barrier. A 
               circling of the wagons. -- BOOM! rush-rush-rush -- BOOM! 
               Each louder than the last. Stephen and Brian are ducked behind 
               an overturned desk. Adcox and Krizminski clutch hoselines 
               like frontiersmen's Winchesters.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're gonna love this.

               -- rush-rush-rush -- CRAAAASH!! On an instant the world comes 
               apart as all four walls of factory windows EXPLODE in a hail 
               of glass. A wave of HOWLING FLAME POURS IN after it, SHRIEKING 
               and HISSING.

               At the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing 
               machine GIVES WAY and a ladderman, SANTOS, FALLS THROUGH, 
               grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames BELLOW UP 
               from underneath. He SCREAMS as his grip loosens.

               Grindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and 
               coat. Brian hesitates just an instant and Stephen SHOVES him 
               out of the way to back up Grindle.

                                     SANTOS
                         Help... Oh God...

               Adcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire. Water and 
               flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling 
               ROAR. It's a thrashing, murderous standoff.

               Stephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angle's bad. 
               Blow it now and all three could take a header. Santos is 
               panicking, losing his grip. Grindle bores his eyes into the 
               man's with the calm and conviction of Moses.

                                     GRINDLE
                         You go, we go.

               They may all die, but they won't leave him. He calms a little, 
               hangs on till they PULL him out of harm's way. Adcox continues 
               with the hose as suddenly, everyone HITS the deck as the 
               fire EXPLODES over them, BURSTING their coats into flame. 
               Tim's company opens up their line, WASHING everybody down 
               before CHARGING after the fire. A ladderman, NIGHTENGALE, 
               steps on Brian's back.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey!

                                     NIGHTENGALE
                         Sorry man, I thought you were dead.

               Brian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking. Stephen 
               seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over 
               the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he 
               mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a 
               corner. The fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its 
               furious anger. But it's all bluster now, the fire's dying.

                                     PENGELLY
                              (ladder co. captain)
                         Stephen! BC's on the radio. Says 
                         they think a civilian got left behind 
                         downstairs.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Adcox! Take Tim and do a search.

               Adcox leads Tim downstairs. Brian looks shaken up. Stephen 
               helps him roughly to his feet.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Don't you fold on me now, man.

               Brian burns at that and shakes his brother's arm off.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Clear the hose for me.

               Brian's walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it. 
               small voice. Faint. "Help me..."

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, I think it's coming from a 
                         different staircase.

               Nobody hears. -- Brian takes off down the other steps on his 
               own.

               INT. BURNING FACTORY - DOWNSTAIRS

               It's only the fire's ghost here, lazy and slow.

               Off the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines. 
               Brian enters one and drops to his knees.

               Looks under a table, flashes his light behind a work stand. 
               Nothing. He turns to backtrack his way out when A TONGUE OF 
               FLAME suddenly LEAPS up through the floor in front of him, 
               cutting off the door. Brian lands on his ass as it hisses 
               and giggles and dances unreally in front of him.

               I never forget a face, kid. -- That fire from childhood. He 
               could maybe force his way through but Jesus, the way it looks 
               at him --

               -- Brian ROLLS away from it. Looks for another doorway -- 
               And ends up in thick smoke. He drops to a crawl, stays on 
               his belly where the air's clear. When he sees it. Behind 
               some furniture. Something flesh-colored. Shit. It's a body. 
               He crawls up closer. It's a woman. Adrenalin pounding the 
               top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down 
               the hall, makes a turn --

                                     BRIAN
                         I got one!

               EXT. FACTORY - DAY

               -- And now he's bursting from the building onto a short fire 
               escape, shouting at the top of his lungs.

                                     BRIAN
                         I got somebody! I got somebody!

               A sea of media flashbulbs ERUPTS in his face. The press have 
               arrived in force, crowding the street. Brian pushes through 
               them to a clear spot on the far side of the engine. Two fire 
               paramedics rush over as he lowers the figure.

                                     BRIAN
                         Is she... Is she alive?

               The paramedics suddenly stop their efforts. Turn to Brian.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                         I'm afraid you're a little too late 
                         with this one.

               They step aside. Brian looks down. The woman looks strange. 
               Mostly because she's a heavy store DRESSING DUMMY. The 
               paramedics burst into laughter. Brian, looking pale and 
               shaken, turns and walks away. He passes Grindle and Tim, 
               sitting on the pumper's tailboard helping the REAL woman 
               that was found inside.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Sorry to hear about the mannequin. I 
                         heard you two were close.

               Photographers have appeared and are flashing the woman. Dizzy, 
               Brian wanders off, tries to help out with the choking clog 
               of singed factory employees before finally turning quickly 
               into

               EXT. FACTORY ALLEY - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

               Where he barfs his guts out in private. Doubled-over, one 
               arm on the brick wall for support, we see the raw terror. 
               The demons rushing out of him.

                                     BRIAN
                         Shit...

               Someone else does too. Jennifer. Dressed now in a long 
               expensive coat, she's standing at the end of the alley with 
               a clipboard. Brian, ashes smeared across an ashen face, 
               spittle on his chin, doesn't notice her.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (appearing beside him)
                         You all right?

               Stephen isn't pale. He's flushed and buoyant. All this hasn't 
               taken anything from him. It's made his day.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Fine. I'm a little busy right 
                         now.

               Stephen leans against the wall. Folds his arms.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Y'know, you got an awful short memory 
                         for direct orders. I told you to 
                         stay beside me.

                                     BRIAN
                         -- C'mon, Stephen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- You split the team, man. And what 
                         was that crap with the standpipe? 
                         You'd think you and a hose were never 
                         introduced before.

               Stephen turns to leave. Brian yells after him.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamn it Stephen!

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- I told you to stay next to me!

                                     BRIAN
                         -- I was doin' it! I was up there 
                         fucking doin' it. You don't know, 
                         man, you don't know what I did!

                                     STEPHEN
                         What you did was drop the ball, 
                         Probie. Get that right.

                                     PENGELLY
                              (from end of alley)
                         Hey! Stevie! They're callin' for ya.

               Stephen turns to walk away. Pauses.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty 
                         two days a month off sounded pretty 
                         good twelve weeks ago, huh?

               As Stephen leaves, we see that Jennifer's been standing at 
               the end of the alley, listening to them. She's turns and 
               walks as Brian looks up. We register his surprise. He watches 
               her head toward a dynamic-looking guy in his 40s, ALDERMAN 
               SWAYZAK, surrounded by reporters.

               EXT. BURNED BUILDING - FRONT - DAY

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (to reporters)
                         Roger, Paul... How's it going, guys?

                                     REPORTER
                         Another fire in this district. Getting 
                         to be Cinder Alley up here.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (walking up)
                         You used that last week.

               She hands Swayzak a clipboard.

                                     AXE
                              (yelling down from 
                              window)
                              (to Brian)
                         Hey! Probie! We're still workin' 
                         here, man.

               INT. BURNED BUILDING

               Brian and the rest of the company rip open the walls and 
               beat the last weak flames in a final flurry of dingy sparks.

               The moment the smoke clears just a fraction, cigarettes appear 
               in everyone's mouth. Was it good for you? The talk is easy 
               and obscene, the intense camaraderie of shared danger. Ash 
               clods are thrown playfully back and forth in the afterglow 
               of having taken on the worst there is and walking away one 
               more time.

                                     GRINDLE
                              (to Adcox)
                         Stephen man, what's going through 
                         that guy's head? Takin' it on in the 
                         first room... this shit's happening 
                         too often. It could've flashed. 
                         Should've flashed.

                         But it didn't. Guy knows.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Guy's lucky.

               Adcox sees Brian. Smiles.

                                     AXE
                         Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the 
                         clincher. You did okay.

                                     BRIAN
                         My Lt. might have something to say 
                         about that.

                                     AXE
                         Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. 
                         You're working for the toughest Lt. 
                         on the job. Saw him once pick up a 
                         probie he thought was moving too 
                         slow and throw him into a burning 
                         building. It's just bad luck you're 
                         family.

                                     BRIAN
                              (beat)
                         John, when you're in there... in the 
                         fire... do you ever see...

                                     STEPHEN
                              (from across room, 
                              interrupting)
                         C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Adcox)
                         -- Never mind.

               Brian turns and sees out the window Jennifer and Swayzak 
               standing near Rimgale's red fire dept. sedan.

               EXT. FACTORY - DAY

               Rimgale walks up to his sedan.

                                     SHADOW
                         Alderman Swayzak.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Investigator Rimgale.

                                     SHADOW
                         I need to get in the trunk.

               Swayzak's leaning on it. We sense the dislike between them. 
               Swayzak steps aside. Rimgale pops the trunk.

                                     SHADOW
                         Awful expensive shoes to be wearing 
                         at a fireground, Alderman. But then 
                         I guess you haven't been to too many 
                         fires.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I wanted to talk to you about Alan 
                         Seagrave's death. We still haven't 
                         gotten a fire report from your office.

                                     SHADOW
                         You'll have an answer as soon as I 
                         do.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         People are asking how a prominent 
                         taxpayer got stuffed through the 
                         windshield of his own car. They're 
                         asking me.

                                     JENNIFER
                         --The point is, Investigator, you 
                         haven't even told us yet if the fire 
                         was accidental. We're starting to 
                         get the feeling your office is 
                         dragging out this case to embarrass 
                         the Alderman because of his fire 
                         dept. reorganization program --

                                     SHADOW
                         -- You mean his firehouse closing 
                         program, -- Don't you?

                                     JENNIFER
                         We'd just be very disappointed if it 
                         turned out your office was playing 
                         politics.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         -- Because I'm not. I care about 
                         this city, and I care about this 
                         department --

               Rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid.

                                     SHADOW
                              (calm of a monk)
                         Alderman, I have a remarkably 
                         uncomplicated job. To decide if a 
                         fire's arson, and if so catch the 
                         pain in the ass doing it. But to be 
                         honest, if my methodical investigative 
                         methods just happen to muck up the 
                         campaign of certain mayor wanna-bees, 
                         well, I guess I can't say I sleep 
                         any less peacefully.

               And he walks back to the burned building.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         I wish I could just fire the son of 
                         a bitch.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey! Swayzak!

               Stephen's leaning out of an upstairs window. As the TV cameras 
               turn, he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops 
               right into Swayzak's face with a murderous grin.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We almost lost a whole company up 
                         there, Swayzee buddy. Isn't any back-
                         up since you closed '33. And we really 
                         appreciate it, the guys and me. 
                         Honest. I know you've got my vote 
                         for mayor.

               Grindle and Santos start walking for Stephen. Brian's there, 
               following after them.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Look Lt., I'm on your side. If there's 
                         a problem, please, work with our 
                         task force to fix it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Oh yeah, your famous task force... 
                         three guys have already died this 
                         year because of the cuts made by 
                         your "task force"...

                                     GRINDLE
                         Stevie, c'mon man...

               Stephen silences Grindle with an outstretched hand. Swayzak 
               leans close, out of earshot of the cameras.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         You see that funny glow that's 
                         starting to blink in the corner of 
                         your eye, Lt? That's your career 
                         dissipation light -- and it just 
                         went into overtime.

                                     STEPHEN
                         If anybody's light's gonna blink, 
                         it's yours.

               Swayzak holds his ground. It's a tense, out of control moment 
               between them. Rimgale turns from his work, watches Stephen 
               with concern. Adcox suddenly inserts himself face-to-face 
               with Swayzak and we see the raw hatred.

                                     AXE
                         You're in firemanland now, Swayzak. 
                         Do yourself a favor and just walk 
                         away.

               Swayzak holds Adcox's gaze, then turns for his car. Brian 
               watches Jennifer climb in beside her boss.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is your city job?

               Jennifer shrugs as they pull away.

               INT./EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - LATE DAY

               Brian jumps down from the rig as it backs up the driveway. 
               Across the street a middle-aged woman flashes them from the 
               balcony of her apartment.

                                     AXE
                         That's Franny. She likes firemen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim, fill out the alarm card.
                              (to Brian)
                         Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the 
                         ladders and hang some hose.

               Adcox watches Brian and Tim exchange looks. Tim shrugs. Brian 
               sighs and pulls out the pike poles, starts across the floor 
               before freezing suddenly at a murderous GROWL. Brian turns 
               and sees a DOG. Sort of. It has the rib cage of a wild beast, 
               fangs, long greasy hair. It blocks his way, SNARLING with 
               hate.

                                     GRINDLE
                         That's The Thing. You can't stay 
                         unless he likes you.

               Slobber drools out of its mouth as it GROWLS.

                                     BRIAN
                         Have you guys got something against 
                         dalmatians?

               Brian wipes some of the crusted grime from his face, looks 
               back and forth between Franny and The Thing, and sighs.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - LOCKER ROOM

               Brian enters, strips down his battered uniform, and opens 
               his locker. The mannequin from the fire SPRINGS OUT, legs 
               spread. A sign taped to its mouth says: "TAKE ME BRIAN, YOU'RE 
               MY SUPERMAN!"

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - WASHROOM

               Brian and the others scrub the morning's fire off their bodies 
               in the station shower. Tim keeps filling his mouth full of 
               water and launching it upward in a stream.

                                     BRIAN
                         Do you have to do that?

                                     TIM
                              (pumped)
                         Could you believe that fire? Man! 
                         First day! There I was, Adcox and 
                         me, pullin' that lady right out of 
                         the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it 
                         here -- No surround and drown for 
                         this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn 
                         Stephen's amazing. You see how he 
                         took that fire by the balls? I'm 
                         gonna be that good some day, you 
                         watch.

               Brian compares himself to the praise heaped on Stephen.

                                     TIM
                         Y'know what Stephen said to me, right 
                         when all the shit was coming hard? 
                         "You never know till the moment the 
                         fire stares you down if you're just 
                         gonna do this job or be great at 
                         it".

                                     BRIAN
                         Ah man, is he usin' that line now on 
                         you? What, you think he made that 
                         little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used 
                         to have to listen to my old man use 
                         that every morning.

               Brian shuts off his shower and walks out.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM

               Stephen sits alone at his bunk, slowly stretching a strained 
               and ruined back. He blows out a long, tired breath, and begins 
               working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered knee.

               On the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia 
               through the years. There's a two battered fire helmets there, 
               set reverently on velvet. Beside it is a photograph of his 
               father. Grinning. Top of the world. He's wearing a T-shirt 
               proudly stenciled FIGHTING 17th.

               Father and son exchange a long, awkward greeting.

               In the doorway, Brian stands watching his brother, who not 
               even 40, suddenly seems an old and broken man.

               The ALARM KLAXON suddenly sounds. Brian, just in a towel and 
               Tim, in boxers covered with little dinosaurs, dash for the 
               fire pole.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR

               Tim and Brian slide down and bounce off the floor.

                                     GRINDLE
                         -- C'mon! C'mon! Go! Go!

               Brian and Tim rush for their equipment. Grindle grabs their 
               arms.

                                     GRINDLE
                         No! C'mon! This way!

               He hustles them across the apparatus floor, through a doorway, 
               and into the kitchen.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - KITCHEN/DINING AREA

               The makings of a meal are laid out on the counter. Brian and 
               Tim come to a screeching halt. The rest of the station is 
               sitting calmly at the kitchen table, watching.

                                     BRIAN
                         What's going on?

                                     PENGELLY
                         Dinner, Probies. Get started.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - KITCHEN

               Tim and Brian, still in their boxers, set down plates of 
               food.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Better be good.

                                     SANTOS
                         Or we feed you to The Thing.

               Everybody digs in. The table is a craze of half a dozen 
               different conversations. On the TV mounted above on the wall 
               are news shots of Seagrave's body sticking out of the 
               windshield.

               Adcox stands and tinks his glass with a spoon for silence.

                                     AXE
                         Gentlemen, please... As 17's official 
                         toastmaster --

                                     SANTOS
                         And bullshitter.

                                     AXE
                         Thank you, Santos. Did I happen to 
                         mention that you were cut out of my 
                         will?
                              (company laughs)
                         I think it appropriate that we 
                         recognize the two asswipes -- I mean 
                         probationary firemen -- among us who 
                         today were baptized officially into 
                         the world of Old Man Fire. First to 
                         Tim, who despite being handicapped 
                         at birth with a rather dull expression 
                         and a really hideous pair of ears, 
                         not only took on the beast but pulled 
                         from its clutches -- assisted by a 
                         more famous and brilliant firefighter -- 
                         me -- a kicking and screaming civilian 
                         that will probably end up suing us 
                         for breaking her fingernail.
                              (laughs)
                         And to Brian, who's own contribution 
                         was both more beautiful and less 
                         likely to sue.

               Adcox puts his arm affectionately around the mannequin, seated 
               with honor at the head of the table. Right beside The Thing.

                                     AXE
                         Y'know, when I heard that both 
                         McCaffrey brothers were going to be 
                         assigned together here, well, my 
                         heart was filled with... a sudden 
                         desire to transfer.
                              (laughs)
                         So raise a glass, lads. To funny-
                         looking Tim, and the McCaffrey 
                         brothers, who despite years of getting 
                         on each other's nerves have managed 
                         with great effort... to still be 
                         pissed off at each other. Gentlemen!

                                     COMPANY
                              (together, a toast)
                         Fuck you!

               The klaxon suddenly rings. Two bells. The ladder guys groan 
               and get up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Bye, boys.

                                     SCHMIDT
                              (winks)
                         We'll keep it warm for you.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM

               Dawn lightens the room as Brian slowly opens his eyes and 
               sees in extreme, fish-eyes close-up: THE THING GROWLING at 
               him. Brian turns the other direction and sees Stephen, fully 
               dressed, standing over his bunk.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Clean the toilets.

               INT. APPARATUS FLOOR

               Bleary-eyed, the nine firemen line up raggedly in front of 
               their rigs, dressed like shit but for peaked uniform caps 
               they wear only at this moment. Stephen stands before them, 
               does a quick glance up and down the line.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Okay, company dismissed. -- See ya 
                         guys tonight at Fitzgerald's 
                         retirement party.

               They shuffle for the door. As Brian passes,

                                     STEPHEN
                         You want a ride?

               EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

               Stephen pulls up. Brian opens the door.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian --
                              (a beat that hangs 
                              there)
                         -- See ya tonight.

               INT. RESTAURANT - RETIREMENT PARTY - NIGHT

               That's been cleared out for a huge PARTY in full swing. An 
               Irish folk band cuts loose a merciless bagpipe beat. City 
               brass--including Alderman Swayzak -- a few reporters, firemen 
               and their families all mix together for this is a RETIREMENT 
               PARTY for the Captain Fitzgerald. Brian enters, seeks out a 
               beer at the bar. Stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly 
               not his first drink of the evening.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey.

               CHEERS as a one joke gift after another is laid on the Chief. 
               Stephen sees his ex-wife, Helen, dancing with another man. 
               He turns away.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I gotta change the view...

               Santos and Grindle walk up.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Heard you didn't make the list for 
                         captain, man. I'm sorry...

               Stephen just shrugs.

               Brian sees Jennifer across the room. She looks great. Refined 
               as she expertly works the room, schmoozing and hugging and 
               calling various politicos by their first name.

               As she speaks to one, a waiter offers a drink. As she accepts, 
               a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red 
               syrup.

                                     BRIAN
                              (holding bottle, 
                              interrupting)
                         With grenadine, right?

                                     JENNIFER
                         When I was twenty.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oooh, very sophisticated. Having 
                         fun?

               Her attention broken, the politico has slipped away. Annoyed, 
               Jennifer leads Brian aside and speaks low, but angrily at 
               him.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Look, I'm not the same girl who had 
                         nothing better to do than wrap her 
                         legs around you on a Saturday night. 
                         This isn't about fun. I'm working 
                         here.

                                     BRIAN
                         Carrying Swayzak's notebook?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Let me tell you something. Martin 
                         Swayzak is going to be this town's 
                         next mayor.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. 
                         How can you work for that guy?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Why do you think Marty came here 
                         tonight? Because he cares about your 
                         department. You don't know how hard 
                         he works. You don't know about his 
                         programs helping West Side --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- All I know is that his programs 
                         are getting firemen hurt.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about 
                         efficiency. I've got two cousins on 
                         the job, you think I'd work for him 
                         if I didn't believe in it?

               Jennifer instantly cuts off as a well-dressed COUPLE passes 
               and switches stunningly into schmmoze-mode.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (to man)
                         -- Tom, how nice to see you. I know 
                         Marty'll be very happy you came. 
                         Thanks so much for the donation.
                              (to woman)
                         Marie... how's little Kevin? Really? 
                         Seen the polls? This is the year...

               They move away. Jennifer turns to Brian and switches just as 
               fast back to their argument.

                                     JENNIFER
                         -- The thing that really makes me 
                         angry is the way your union has --

               Brian can't help it. He cracks up.

                                     BRIAN
                         What was that? Oh man, you have picked 
                         up a few moves since John Paul II 
                         Boulevard.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Yeah, well I like to think I'm just 
                         a little past hanging out on JP II 
                         watching the Irish pick fights and 
                         Litwalks barf in the planters.

                                     BRIAN
                         I seem to remember some pretty good 
                         nights on JP II.

               Brian turns and walks away.

               ACROSS THE ROOM

               Adcox is talking with another knot of firemen. He's brought 
               a date, SALLY, a hot little number that has a habit of 
               standing on her tip-toes when she talks.

                                     SALLY
                              (looking at Swayzak 
                              across room)
                         Yuck, what a scumbag.

                                     AXE
                              (to Santos)
                         Fuckin' city transferred Sally three 
                         months ago out of parking violations 
                         into Swayzak's office. Now I gotta 
                         pay my own goddamn tickets and she's 
                         stuck with an asshole.

                                     SANTOS
                         Pay more?

                                     SALLY
                              (shrugs)
                         No, but there's more exercise -- 
                         being chased around a desk.

               There's a commotion at the other end of the bar. A group of 
               firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Aw, I don't believe this shit.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         Somebody get a shovel! You seen this, 
                         Stephen?

               As they hold it up to Stephen we see a photo spread titled 
               DARING FIRE RESCUE.

               The first photo shows Brian rushing out of the burning 
               building with seemingly a woman in his arms. The second photo 
               shows the backs of Adcox and Tim's helmets as they 
               administered aid to the real woman they saved. The implication 
               is it's the same woman.

                                     BRIAN
                         What?

                                     TIM
                              (reads)
                         "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, 
                         on his very first fire, showed the 
                         kind of bravery and courage of a 
                         veteran firefighter when he risked 
                         life and limb to double-check a 
                         burning floor alone, emerging 
                         victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a 
                         seamstress for the North Shore 
                         Clothing Company... McCaffrey first 
                         gained prominence as the subject of 
                         a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning 
                         photograph taken at the scene of his 
                         father's death..."

               The old photo is there too. Brian and his dad's helmet.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Whadda we gonna do about this?

               Stephen glances over the headlines.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Y'know, I think it's a union bylaw 
                         that if a guy gets in the paper -- 
                         especially if it's bullshit -- he 
                         owes the company a drink. In fact...
                              (motions to waiter)
                         ...I'll have a double. On the hero.

               The other firemen jump in with drink orders. Dozens of them.

                                     BRIAN
                              (confused)
                         What's going on?

               Tim shows him the magazine. Brian reads with horror as 
               Alderman Swayzak appears beside him.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Brian McCaffrey, right?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian, this is my boss, Alderman 
                         Swayzak.
                              (to Swayzak)
                         Brian's a big fan of yours.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. Big fan.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         And I'm a huge fan of what you did 
                         to save that woman, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, I think there's been a mistake. 
                         I didn't save that woman.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         No need to be modest, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         No, you don't understand, I saved a 
                         mannequin.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         -- That really was incredibly work 
                         you did. You and your brother, 
                         fighting fires together, helluva 
                         image, isn't it? You must feel lucky 
                         to be assigned under his command.

                                     BRIAN
                         Every little boy's fantasy.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Brian, let me come to the point. I'd 
                         like to offer you a job.

                                     BRIAN
                         I have a job.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         This one's still with the fire 
                         department. One of our best 
                         investigators, Don Rimgale, is working 
                         on a very difficult, visible case 
                         right now. We think he could use 
                         another pair of hands and you're 
                         exactly the kind of guy I want 
                         representing us: An authentic hero 
                         from a traditional firefighting clan.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions --
                         like dying young.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Not every job in the fire department 
                         comes with a tombstone, Brian. This 
                         could be a great opportunity to 
                         move... beyond a fire engine.

               Brian looks at Jennifer, then smiles at Swayzak.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks anyway, Mr. Swayzak, but fire 
                         engines sorta run in my family. 
                         Politics don't.

               -- A man suddenly steps between them to pump Swayzak's hand. 
               Brian shakes his head and walks away. Swayzak shoots a 
               concerned glance at Jennifer. She catches up with him at the 
               buffet table.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Boy, took you all of thirty seconds 
                         to blow that.

                                     BRIAN
                         C'mon Jennifer, he's just another 
                         North-Side jag-off with a mouth.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian, do you always have to be so 
                         stupid? Think about your future for 
                         once.

                                     BRIAN
                         So now you suddenly care about my 
                         future?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Look, I didn't mean to take a piece 
                         out of you back there, I just thought 
                         you'd call when you came back. You 
                         didn't and...
                              (beat)
                         Don't blow it just because of this 
                         garbage between us.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in 
                         front of your boss. But I'm not gonna 
                         be a poster boy for him, I'm trying 
                         to do something here. There's five 
                         hundred smoke eaters in this room 
                         that do that stuff for real every 
                         day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of 
                         them.

               Across the room, Stephen's at the buffet, watching Helen 
               dance with her fireman date, the drinks hammering him hard.

                                     PENGELLY
                         Aw man, how can she dance with that 
                         guy?

                                     SCHMIDT
                         I hate that guy. He's a dispatcher. 
                         I hate his voice.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Whatever...

                                     PENGELLY
                         I mean, I know women have gotta bang 
                         somebody, but why that son of a bitch?

               Stephen gives Pengelly an icy, sideways look.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         Hey Stevie, he's an asshole...

               Stephen smiles and pushes off the bar -- right for Helen as 
               she dances.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a 
                         second about Sean...

                                     HELEN
                         Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we 
                         talk about this later?

                                     DATE
                         How ya doin', Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jackson.

               Jackson steers her away but Stephen isn't done yet. He dogs 
               them.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Helen)
                         What's wrong with right now? He's 
                         your son for christ's sake. He's --

                                     JACKSON
                         Hey, Stephen, what about that dumb 
                         ass brother of yours, huh?

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...Yeah?

                                     JACKSON
                         Savin' a mannequin... How fuckin' 
                         stupid can a guy get?

               Stephen suddenly PUNCHES Jackson.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You can't talk about my brother like 
                         that...

                                     HELEN
                              (sighs)
                         Here we go...

               And Stephen PLOWS into Jackson. Another fireman JUMPS to 
               Jackson's aid. And Brian's there, defending his brother, 
               PUNCHING OUT a fireman. The crowd finally pulls the two apart.

                                     JACKSON
                         You're crazy, man!

                                     STEPHEN
                         Leave me alone!

                         Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!
                              (Stephen calms a little)
                         You stupid dumbshit, you never know 
                         when to fucking quit, do you? You 
                         ever wonder why your career's in the 
                         fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be 
                         stuck a Lt. for life?

                                     STEPHEN
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         I need a drink.

               Stephen takes a step for the bar -- then suddenly turns and 
               JUMPS Jackson again. Brian pulls him off and drags him for 
               the door.

                                     BRIAN
                         You don't need a drink, man. You 
                         need to get outta here...

               As Jennifer watches Brian lead Stephen out the door.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (to Swayzak)
                         Ah those McCaffreys... just hate 
                         leaving a party with anyone left 
                         standing...

               EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Brian leads Stephen toward his car.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm okay... leave me alone...

               Stephen pushes Brian away and promptly stumbles to the 
               sidewalk.

                                     BRIAN
                         So you got a 'roid going with Jackson 
                         or what?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Nah, he's nothin'. It's just 
                         sometimes... sometimes you just gotta 
                         punch somebody out, y'know?

               Brian stands there and folds his arms.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I don't think I can get up.

               Brian lends an arm.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I 
                         can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, 
                         too.

                                     BRIAN
                         C'mon, let's crawl home.

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT

               Stephen throws an arm over Brian's shoulder as he leads him 
               up onto the boat.

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...Adcox, those guys...they don't 
                         get it... it isn't the goddamn 
                         promotion... or dad... I'm not my 
                         old man, y'know? No fire's gonna get 
                         me... I don't give a shit about being 
                         a captain... it's just... it's just 
                         they don't trust me anymore...
                              (blows out painful 
                              breath)
                         ...they don't trust me anymore...

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT

               Brian's flops his brother on the bed. Unties his shoes.

                                     STEPHEN
                         If you'd get out of my fuckin' way. 
                         I could take my own goddamn shoes 
                         off...

               He clearly can't. Brian slips them off.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're such a pain in the ass... 
                         You've always been a pain in the 
                         ass...

               There's just a grim wall lamp above Stephen's face.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... 
                         Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' 
                         blind...

                                     BRIAN
                              (touching light)
                         This?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah... too bright...

               Brian turns off the dim light. Stephen's breathing deepens.

                                     STEPHEN
                         They don't know... they don't know 
                         what I hear in there...

               Brian tucks the blanket around him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...This boat could be okay, huh?... 
                         Take it out weekends... Sean 'n me...

               Stephen's voice drifts off into sleep. Brian watches a moment, 
               the rare look of peace on his brother's face, then leaves.

               EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - NIGHT

               Dark and still. Brian, carrying a roll of hose, scales the 
               chain link.

               EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - EXERCISE GROUND - NIGHT

               Is a practice stand-pipe. Brian counts down to himself, then 
               rushes the stand-pipe, spinning off the cap with a hydrant 
               wrench and attaching the hose coupling. He does it again, 
               over and over.

               EXT. FIRE ACADEMY - DAWN

               The sky's gone pink and blue as Brian climbs back over the 
               fence. Adcox, coming out of a donut shop across the street, 
               sees him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET - CHICKEN ACCIDENT - DAY

               A truck has JACKKNIFED across the avenue and SPILLED its 
               contents -- several THOUSAND baby chicks. They're scurrying 
               everywhere as Brian's company tries to round them up. It's 
               hopeless as the exhausted firemen stuff handfuls of the 
               cheeping cargo into their turn-out coats. There's ghetto 
               kids all around, grabbing at the chicks, grabbing at the 
               fire engine.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (at kids)
                         Hey! Knock it off!

               Brian stops a beat. Rubs his eyes.

                                     AXE
                              (smiles)
                         Maybe you should have gotten more 
                         sleep last night.

               Brian looks at him. Does he mean what he thinks he means? 
               Tim is coming out of a small store across the street. He 
               hands a small bag of groceries to Adcox.

                                     TIM
                         This everything you wanted?

               Everyone grows suddenly silent.

               EXT. WIDOW'S HOUSE - DAY

               A fireman's without even saying so, "Petzold" on the mailbox, 
               Engine 17 parked out front. Brian's alone outside, cleaning 
               the diesel fuel off his arms. Watching a small kid playing 
               with a toy fire truck in the drive.

               INT. WIDOW'S HOUSE

               Tim and Brian are loading the groceries into the fridge. 
               Stephen and Grindle are fixing a loose cabinet door as Adcox 
               sits caulking a faucet fitting at the kitchen table with a 
               young WOMAN.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to Stephen)
                         Can I help you guys at all?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Nah, we just about got it.

                                     WOMAN
                              (noticing Adcox's 
                              shirt)
                         Sally must be finally ironing your 
                         shirts.

                                     AXE
                         It's just new. Couple'a shifts and 
                         it'll be as thrashed as the rest.

               The sight of uniform is too much for her. Her eyes cloud.

                                     WOMAN
                         I'm sorry...

               Adcox reaches out and lets her weep on his shoulder.

                                     AXE
                         It's okay...

                                     WOMAN
                         I miss him... I just miss him, 
                         y'know?...

               EXT. WIDOW'S HOUSE - DAY

               Adcox stands out at the fire engine smoking a cigarette, 
               lost in himself, watching the little boy play with his toy 
               fire truck. Stephen's followed him out.

                                     AXE
                         This job... This fuckin' job 
                         sometimes... To buy it trying to go 
                         the extra yard, man, that's one thing, 
                         but to buy it just because there 
                         wasn't any back-up... it's bullshit...

               Stephen leans down close.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah, it's bullshit. So what? Fuck 
                         Swayzak. Fuck 'em all. We don't go 
                         into fires for them. You know that. 
                         Christ, you taught me that.

               A beat of understanding between them. Stephen looks back at 
               the house.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You know Knowlton pretty well?

                                     AXE
                         Yeah...

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat)
                         Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?

               Adcox can't help but smile.

                                     AXE
                         Biggest in two battalions.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat, smiles)
                         We're gonna be okay, man...

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY

               As Brian and Tim scrub down the fire engine, the rest of the 
               company lies sprawled in

               THE STATION REC ROOM

               Watching a weepy soap. Schmidt walks through and is snared 
               by the TV's glow. He hesitates. Shares the moment.

                                     SCHMIDT
                         Is she going to get the divorce?

                                     SANTOS
                              (sighs with honest 
                              concern)
                         Hell if I know, man.

               A ladderman, WASHINGTON, walks in with a memo.

                                     WASHINGTON
                         Hey, Pengelly, you made the captain's 
                         list!

               Everybody clasps Pengelly on the shoulder. "Way to go". "All 
               right, man". Brian turns and sees Stephen out on the apparatus 
               floor, watching. Watches. Pengelly's younger than him.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - TRAINING BUILDING/HOSE TOWER - DAY

               An expanse of concrete lying out back of the station. Built 
               in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training 
               building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each 
               level. Twenty yards away, Brian, Tim and Adcox stand ready 
               beside a pile of coiled hose rolls.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (looking at watch)
                         Alright... Go!

               Tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his 
               shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building. 
               There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags 
               the other end inside and up a flight of stairs.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Go!

               Brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the 
               building.

                                     STEPHEN
                         That isn't a football, probie. Get 
                         it on your shoulder.

               Brian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end. 
               Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another 
               two flights. It's a bitch.

               Sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming 
               up with another roll.

                                     BRIAN
                         Having fun, fireman?

               Tim flips him off. Brian laughs and sprints for another roll.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You're not breaking any records, 
                         Brian.

               Brian holds it under his arm and takes off. Stephen grabs a 
               roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Your shoulder. Like this!

               Brian lifts it to his shoulder.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Come on! Pick it up!

               They come to the doorway. Instead of stopping, Stephen follows 
               Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. Without a word 
               spoken it's become a race between them.

               Brian's face explodes in sweat. His heart pounds as they go 
               up flight after flight. The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. A 
               thousand. Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats 
               burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen STUMBLES and 
               SCRAPES his leg. Brian pauses. Stephen's already back on his 
               feet.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Run, damn you!

               Brian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready 
               to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof, 
               Brian the "winner" by a nose. Stephen drops his hose roll, 
               sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs. Unsure, Brian 
               starts to join in. Stephen stops suddenly.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Roll the hose.

                                     BRIAN
                         What, are you kidding? By myself?

               Adcox and Tim, down below, have already disappeared back 
               into the station.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You heard me.

               We see now what Stephen apparently doesn't. He was scraped 
               badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood.

                                     BRIAN
                         What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll 
                         let you win next time.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (in Brian's face)
                         You got a problem with drilling, 
                         probie?

                                     BRIAN
                         No, Lt., I don't have a problem with 
                         drilling. But let's just have one 
                         drill. Not one for the company and 
                         one for me.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Roll the hose.

               Stephen turns and walks away. Brian stands there watching 
               him in blind fury, finally exploding.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamn you Stephen, I'm not gonna 
                         quit. You hear me!

               An awkward beat between them that's interrupted suddenly by 
               the station alarm klaxon. Stephen smiles.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Well, thank God for fires...

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Smoke and confusion. A MOTHER is screaming hysterically at 
               Stephen as he jumps down from the engine.

                                     MOTHER
                              (grabbing his coat)
                         My baby! My baby's still up there!

                                     BATTALION CHIEF
                         Hang on a sec, Stevie, we got a 
                         hoseline coming.

               Stephen doesn't even pause and enters the building. Brian 
               hesitates a beat, then follows.

               INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Where they bomb up a staircase just as a WALL OF FIRE LASHES 
               DOWN, KNOCKING them on their ass. Stephen jumps to his feet 
               with an axe as Brian struggles to get up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Don't take that kind of shit from 
                         it! Don't let it know you're scared! 
                         Come on!

               Stephen, with just his axe, CHASES up the stairs at the fire, 
               HAMMERING at the flaming boards. The fire retreats into 
               another room, SLAMMING the door shut behind it.

               Brian struggles up the stairs. The two of them slide up on 
               either side of the closed door, Stephen cradling his axe 
               like a SWAT team shotgun. The door breathes in and out and 
               something animal scratches and snarls on the other side.

               Brian can feel the panic rising in his throat. That thing 
               behind the door, that slobbering, evil thing. It wants out. 
               It wants... him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Ready?

                                     BRIAN
                         Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the 
                         hose team...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I 
                         say... It won't get us.

               Stephen HAMMERS the lock with his axe and KICKS the door 
               open. A WALL OF FLAME ROARS out past their cheeks, then 
               BACKWASHES in.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Now!

               Stephen picks up the door, and using it as a shield CHARGES 
               into the flames. Brian tries to follow but the fire WELLS 
               UP, cutting him off. He hesitates. It's that goddamn flame 
               again, leering at him. Daring him. It BUCKS suddenly, DROPPING 
               Brian to his knee. He GROANS in pain.

               -- And now Adcox and Grindle are coming up the stairs with a 
               hoseline WASHING DOWN the room. Clouds of furious steam bellow 
               out and across the ceiling. Nobody could be alive in there.

               Except Stephen. His entire outfit smoldering, he emerges 
               from the clouds like a fucking god, carrying in one arm a 
               gasping child.

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - AFTERMATH - DAY

               Most of the firemen have gathered together for post-fire 
               coffee and stories. Brian sits off alone on the fire engine 
               bumper, apart from them. Santos walks up.

                                     SANTOS
                         They think she's gonna live...

               Stephen walks up. Sits down beside him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You okay?

                                     BRIAN
                         I waited... I would have fucking 
                         waited...

                                     STEPHEN
                         That's not what it's about, Brian. 
                         The point is there was a kid in there. 
                         And what if there'd been two? I went 
                         in because that's what I do. It's my 
                         way. It's dad's way. It isn't 
                         everybody's way.

                                     BRIAN
                         Dad's way? Where did he tell you 
                         that? In a fucking seance?

                                     STEPHEN
                         You said you wanted to know something, 
                         Brian. What did you learn today?
                              (Brian doesn't answer)
                         What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to 
                         move on?

               Brian lingers only a moment before standing.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're right, Stephen... You win... 
                         You're the best, man...

               Brian hands Stephen his helmet and walks away.

               INT. SWAYZAK'S OFFICE - DAY

               There's only six like it in city hall, and this one has a 
               view.

                                     SECRETARY'S VOICE
                              (on intercom)
                         Brian McCaffrey on line two for 
                         Jennifer.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I'll take it in my office.

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (turns to her and 
                              smiles)
                         Go get him.

               INT. CORRIDOR/CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Jennifer comes out of Swayzak's office and walks down to her 
               own.

               INT. JENNIFER'S OFFICE/INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

               -- It's a tiny, bleak little rat hole. She picks up the 
               receiver...

                                     JENNIFER
                         Brian?

               We see Brian in his apartment.

                                     BRIAN
                         I've been thinking about what you 
                         said the other night... If the offer's 
                         still on the table, I'd like to talk 
                         about it.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (beat)
                         ...Okay. I'll arrange things with 
                         your assignment captain.
                              (beat)
                         Marty's a good man, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah...

               Brian hangs up. He stares at it a moment, then SLAMS it 
               against the wall.

               Jennifer stares at the phone with something almost like 
               sadness.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Stephen drives past the burned-out brownstone that fried 
               Alan Seagrave. He parks in the alley behind, walks up the 
               building, and PULLS OFF a plywood sheet covering a blown-out 
               window.

               INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

               Stephen walks through the creepy, brutalized silence. Back 
               to where Rimgale had focused his investigation that night. 
               He searches the floor, the wall, looking for something...

               EXT. ARSON HQ/FIREHOUSE - DAY

               A crumbling one in Chinatown. Brian checks the address on 
               his slip of paper. He stands there a beat, hating himself.

               INT. FIRE STATION/ARSON HQ

               It's a regular station but for the rear that has been 
               converted into arson squad offices. As Brian approaches the 
               office door he can see Rimgale sitting at his desk. Standing 
               nervously beside it is a fresh-faced, uniformed PROBIE.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to probie)
                         ...So stop me if I get this wrong... 
                         The fire's almost out... You're 
                         upstairs on the unburned floor 
                         checking for heat. You've been told 
                         by your Battalion Chief, your Captain, 
                         by me, not to do anything up there 
                         until ordered. But now the itch 
                         starts, and all of a sudden comes 
                         the Glory Boy Flash: Hey, I'm a hero. 
                         Heroes don't just stand around. So 
                         on your own you decided to punch out 
                         a window for ventilation. Was that 
                         before or after you noticed you were 
                         standing in a lake of gasoline?

               The kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation.

                                     SHADOW
                         You could've crispered half your 
                         company with that little stunt, but 
                         more importantly you wrecked the 
                         physical evidence I use to prove 
                         it's arson. You've made my day longer, 
                         Probie. Go home and think about that.

               The kid shuffles off hang-dog. Rimgale's angry gaze falls on 
               Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new 
                         assistant.

                                     SHADOW
                         Your Dennis' kid.
                              (beat)
                         I work alone.

               And Rimgale walks into his office, leaving Brian marooned in 
               the doorway. Stepping behind a small partition, Rimgale 
               changes his shirt. Brian can just glimpse from where he stands 
               a horrible burn that has consumed most of Rimgale's stomach. 
               Rimgale catches the look.

                                     SHADOW
                         Are you still here?

                                     BRIAN
                         Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not 
                         going anywhere.

                                     SHADOW
                         Then go find a corner. I don't want 
                         you in my way.

                                     BRIAN
                         I think we should get something 
                         straight here. I was assigned to 
                         this office by the city.

                                     SHADOW
                         Look, I knew your father, he had a 
                         helluva reputation on this job. But 
                         that don't mean you get any slack. 
                         Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I 
                         gotta eat you, that's the rules and 
                         I got nothing to say about that. But 
                         Swayzak or no, you live with me. 
                         Step out of line, and I don't care 
                         who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.
                              (beat)
                         You think you're the first?

               Rimgale glances at his watch, puts on his coat, and picks up 
               a small paper bag.

                                     BRIAN
                         Where are you going?

                                     SHADOW
                         Pest control.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAX SECURITY PRISON - DAY

               And the face of RONALD, an unremarkable man in his 40s. 
               Unremarkable but for laser eyes and two heavily bandaged 
               hands. Go wide and find him sitting in an institutional chair -- 
               handcuffed, actually -- in an institutional hall. A uniformed 
               guard stands nearby as Brian and Rimgale come down the 
               corridor. Ronald smiles upon seeing Rimgale.

                                     RONALD
                         Shadow.

                                     SHADOW
                         How ya doin', Ronald. Staying 
                         comfortable?

                                     RONALD
                         Didn't think you'd make it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Wouldn't miss this for the world, 
                         pal.

                                     RONALD
                              (looking at Brian)
                         Who's this?

                                     SHADOW
                         He works for me.

                                     RONALD
                         Is he a fireman?
                              (smiles)
                         I like firemen.

                                     SHADOW
                         You like everybody, Ronald.

               Ronald's eyes pick up Brian's name on his prison ID badge.

                                     RONALD
                         Brian McCaffrey...
                              (eyes light up happily)
                         Oh this is really a treat. Brian 
                         McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, 
                         huh?

                                     BRIAN
                              (heating up)
                         Hey, do I know you?

                                     SHADOW
                         You don't know him.

                                     RONALD
                         I know you.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Ronald)
                         What the hell are you talking about 
                         my --

               Rimgale silences Brian with a threatening hand.

                                     SHADOW
                         Knock it off. Now.

                                     RONALD
                         Tell him about me, Shadow?

                                     SHADOW
                         Ronald here likes telephones. Used 
                         to tape wooden matches to the bell 
                         striker and wrap it in cotton. Came 
                         up with a whole little thing there, 
                         didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, 
                         what did you do? You just started 
                         making calls... mostly day care 
                         centers and retirement homes, wasn't 
                         it?

                                     RONALD
                         Did he tell you how we finally met?

                                     SHADOW
                         Nobody cares, Ronald.

                                     RONALD
                         Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. 
                         You're depriving our famous young 
                         friend here...

                                     VOICE IN CORRIDOR
                         Okay... Ronald Bowland...

               The cop helps Ronald to his feet and all four are marching 
               down the hall.

                                     RONALD
                         It was on State Street, right?... 
                         Just your basic warehouse torch for 
                         the owner. Cakewalk. But the animal... 
                         turned on me... 'Ol Shadow here, he 
                         shows up -- whole place is going 
                         like hell -- my hair, my hands... 
                         could've just let the animal take me -- 
                         but Shadow, he's a good camper, so 
                         he tries to pull 'ol Ronald out. 
                         Guess he didn't notice the tub of 
                         phosphorous next to me...
                              (smiles)
                         Notice you're still a little shy 
                         about rolling your sleeves up, Shadow. 
                         Show him your stomach yet?

               INT. PRISON - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

               Ronald in the hot seat before a parole board, Rimgale and 
               Brian on the sidelines.

                                     MAN
                         ...All right, the parole board has 
                         received Mr. Bowland's fitness report, 
                         his ID-44, endorsement from his 
                         section warden... Dr. Norris?

                                     WOMAN PSYCHIATRIST
                         As supervising psychiatrist I would 
                         describe Mr. Bowland's progress as 
                         remarkable. Taking into account his 
                         disability and the six years already 
                         served, I recommend parole.

                                     MAN
                         Mr. Bowland, do you regret your 
                         crimes?

                                     RONALD
                         Yes. I understand now the pain I 
                         caused.

                                     MAN
                         If released, will you commit these 
                         crimes again?

                                     RONALD
                         I won't.

                                     MAN
                         Do you consider yourself ready for 
                         society?

                                     RONALD
                         Yes.

               The parole board shuffles their papers. It's a done deal. 
               Rimgale suddenly stands and approaches Ronald.

                                     SHADOW
                         Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.

                                     RONALD
                         Absolutely.

                                     MAN
                              (surprised)
                         Excuse me, Mr. Rimgale.

                                     SHADOW
                         Excuse me.
                              (to Ronald)
                         What do you do with little girls?

               A tortured look comes over Ronald's face. He's holding back. 
               From the paper bag, Rimgale suddenly tosses a burned baby 
               doll in his lap.

                                     SHADOW
                         What do you do with them, Ronald? 
                         Huh?

               Rimgale then lights a cigarette lighter in Ronald's face.

                                     RONALD
                              (smiles)
                         -- Burn them.

                                     SHADOW
                         And old ladies?

                                     RONALD
                         -- Burn them.

                                     SHADOW
                         And the world -- the whole world.

                                     RONALD
                              (smiles)
                         -- Burn it all.

               The parole board stares, stunned. Rimgale stands.

                                     SHADOW
                         See ya next year, Ronald. Gotta go.

               EXT. THEATRE BUILDING - DAY

               A pre-war theatre closed with a sign: UNDER RENOVATION -- 
               OPENING XMAS 1991. DAVID BENTON, mid-forties, climbs out of 
               his car and walks to the entrance with some rolled-up 
               blueprints.

               INT. THEATRE BUILDING - DAY

               Benton walks through the vast theatre and up to a beautiful 
               Art Noveau office door: DAVID BENTON, PRIVATE. He goes to 
               insert his key. Drops it. As he reaches down, we see a tiny 
               wisp of smoke SUCK back under the door. Benton sniffs, as if 
               he smells something, then shrugs and inserts his key. It'd 
               have been a good story if he'd lived longer.

               The moment he pushes the door open It EXPLODES OUTWARD in a 
               ROARING FIREBALL.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THEATRE BUILDING - SUNDOWN

               Later and engine companies have already knocked down the 
               building fire as Brian climbs out of Rimgale's red sedan.

                                     SHADOW
                              (opens trunk)
                         Hey kid, c'mere -- At least make 
                         yourself useful.

               He starts handing Brian handfuls of equipment cases. Loaded 
               down, Brian follows Rimgale into the building.

               INT. THEATRE BUILDING

               Fire crews are at work in here, including Engine 17 at the 
               other end of the theatre. Brian's surprised to see them, his 
               eyes locking briefly with Stephen's. An ENGINE COMPANY LT. 
               walks up to Rimgale.

                                     ENGINE LT
                         We were lucky with this one. Could've 
                         taken out the whole complex, but the 
                         explosion blew out most of the flame. 
                         Good for us.
                              (looks to body)
                         -- Not so good for him.

               "Him" is our previous owner, David Benton, just his hands 
               and a leg showing from under the collapsed door. Rimgale 
               crouches beside it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Turn this over.

               Brian does. The corpse's keys are still in the lock. So's 
               Benton. Blown with such force he seems fused with the door. 
               On the door's edge Rimgale notices a small patch of melted, 
               sticky goo. With his penknife he scrapes a sample and seals 
               it in a glass vial, stands, and walks into the office.

               INT. THEATRE OFFICE

                                     BRIAN
                         What do you want me to do with --

               Rimgale, now inside, silences him with an outstretched arm.

                                     SHADOW
                         -- Shhh.

                                     BRIAN
                              (after a beat)
                         What are you listening to?

               Rimgale doesn't answer. His eyes drift over the scorched 
               walls as he speaks softly to them.

                                     SHADOW
                         You sneaky little son of a bitch... 
                         Hide and seek... Come on, tell me 
                         what I want to know...

               He scratches at some soot. Smiles and lifts a small hand 
               recorder.

                                     SHADOW

                         never got hot enough here to cook 
                         soot off. It started somewhere else...

                         Less soot here. More heat.
                              (they enter back room)
                         And very little soot here.
                              (to Brian)
                         Get that couch out of the way.

               Brian pulls it aside. The lower third of the wall is 
               completely untouched by soot.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to himself)
                         So you were happy here. Warm and 
                         cozy and in no hurry...
                              (into recorder)
                         Soot high, clean unburned wall low, 
                         indicates slow burn in thermal 
                         balance.
                              (to Brian)
                         Find me some glass.

                                     BRIAN
                         Glass?

                                     SHADOW
                         Do we have a language barrier here? 
                         Glass.

               There's some on the sill of a blown window. Brian hands a 
               shard to Rimgale, who turns it over in his palm.

                                     SHADOW
                              (into recorder)
                         Glass found in ignition room is in 
                         small, thin pieces, indicating 
                         explosion. Lack of discoloration 
                         indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion 
                         must of come after a slow burn.
                              (shuts recorder off)
                         You little tease... What were you up 
                         to you little bastard, huh? What 
                         made you that mad?
                              (then, an idea)
                         Or scared.
                              (switches on recorder)
                         It started in this room. Took its 
                         time, hung out... but the air ran 
                         out. It couldn't breathe. So it was 
                         snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still 
                         all that trapped heat, lying low, 
                         waiting for some sucker to open the 
                         door and give it that one gulp of 
                         air...

                                     BRIAN
                         -- Another backdraft.

               Rimgale turns to the wall, a section where the plaster is 
               severely damaged. He probes with a penknife.

                                     SHADOW
                         Finish coat burned away... Severe 
                         spawling of rough coat...

               Rimgale follows the damaged wall down -- down -- to a melted 
               wall socket.

                                     SHADOW
                         That's our ignition point. Dig it 
                         out. Carefully.

               Brian chops it out from the wall. Rimgale crouches down, 
               peels back the melted faceplate and examines the wires. The 
               copper tip is severely melted. Rimgale sniffs the plug.

                                     SHADOW
                              (into recorder)
                         Temperature in this room was about 
                         2000 degrees, but copper wire in 
                         outlet is melted, which requires 
                         5000 degrees. An accidental short in 
                         the plug could of created a spark of 
                         7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the 
                         wire and start a fire.

                                     BRIAN
                         No it couldn't.

               Rimgale shuts off the recorder. Stares down Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         I mean you'd be right -- with normal 
                         wire. But that's gauge ten in that 
                         plug -- industrial stuff. Who knows 
                         why they put it in here -- but it 
                         won't melt at less than 12,000 
                         degrees. And no natural spark short 
                         of lightning gets that hot.
                              (Rimgale just stares)
                         In another life I was in high-end 
                         electronics.

               Rimgale opens a plastic bag and puts the plug inside.

                                     SHADOW
                              (into recorder)
                         Have outlet analyzed for any traces 
                         of flammable accelerants.

               Rimgale stands and walks out.

                                     BRIAN
                         Don't mention it.

               INT. THEATRE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Brian follows Rimgale down from the office into the vast 
               theatre. Walls hiss and spit. Brian's surprised to see his 
               former engine mates there, tromping and crunching their way 
               through broken glass, their flashlights like dancing 
               fireflies. Tim passes by.

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey, Tim.

               Everybody turns at the voice and the air suddenly chills.

                                     TIM
                              (distant)
                         Brian.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to Brian)
                         Check the wall for burn patterns.

               And Rimgale's off to another room. Brian turns and looks at 
               the wall. It's endless.

                                     BRIAN
                              (to Tim)
                         So, you surviving without me?

                                     TIM
                         There's no replacement 'cause of 
                         your boss' cuts, if that's what you 
                         mean. If someone else goes out on an 
                         injury we're really screwed.

                                     BRIAN
                         Swayzak's not my boss.

               Silence. Brian looks over the wall. A dirty puddle separates 
               him from it.

                                     GRINDLE
                              (to Brian)
                         Ooooh, like the tie. Love the tie.

                                     BRIAN
                         Grindle, scrape down that wall for 
                         me, huh? I would myself, but the tie 
                         'n all, y'know...

               Grindle stares at him a beat, then wordlessly steps into the 
               muck and pulls free a section of wall, dropping it on the 
               ground in front of Brian. Santos and Grindle look at each 
               other.

                                     SANTOS
                         Uh, Brian, if you're lookin' for 
                         smoke patterns, there's some good 
                         ones over here.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? Where?

                                     GRINDLE
                              (as Brian walks over)
                         Little to the right... further... 
                         further... Right behind there. Hey, 
                         could you hand me that pike pole?

               There's a pike pole leaning against the wall. Brian pulls it 
               aside. SPLASH -- The pole had been supporting a small, sagging 
               piece of ceiling that instantly collapses, dumping twenty 
               gallons of murky, putrid black water all over Brian's civvys. 
               Nobody laughs.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Sorry, maybe that wasn't it after 
                         all.

               Stephen appears around the corner. Sees what's happened.

                                     STEPHEN
                         That's just about enough, guys, okay?

                                     SCHMIDT
                         See ya around, Brian.

               They leave. Brian stands there, humiliated.

                                     AXE
                              (to Brian)
                         What the hell's the matter with you, 
                         huh? You're steppin' in the shit 
                         again. You could've done it. You 
                         don't want this.
                              (the suit 'n tie)
                         Wake up, kid.

               Brian burns with shame and anger as Adcox walks away. Stephen 
               hands Brian a towel.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Here. Dry yourself off.

               Brian snatches it from him. Glares at his brother.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Look, you are sorta making yourself 
                         fair game.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks for the insight.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian, look --

                                     BRIAN
                         Just leave me alone, okay?

               Brian walks away. Stephen calls after him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, Bri... Rimgale's okay. I don't 
                         get half the shit he's talking about, 
                         but then everybody says the same 
                         thing about me. Who the hell knows?

               INT. HELEN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Helen, Stephen's ex-wife, is sitting at her kitchen when she 
               looks up suddenly at a strange sound coming from the roof.

               EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY

               On the short, sloping roof, Stephen stands hammering a shingle 
               back into place. Helen sticks her head out the dormer window.

                                     HELEN
                         Stephen, what are you doing here?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fixing my roof.

                                     HELEN
                         It's not your roof anymore.

               He stops and tosses the hammer aside. Looks at his watch.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Where's Sean?

                                     HELEN
                         He's got piano lessons.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Oh yeah? How's he doing?

                                     HELEN
                         He's going to be a fireman.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Give up, babe. You can't fight it. 
                         Believe me, my mom tried...

                                     HELEN
                              (beat)
                         Stephen, you gotta stop just showing 
                         up on the roof like this.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I just wanted to, I don't know, not 
                         exactly apologize for the other night -- 
                         especially since I don't remember 
                         much of it --

                                     HELEN
                         -- You remember.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah... I just thought I should say, 
                         I don't know, something.

                                     HELEN
                         The great communicator.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Sorry I hit Jackson.

                                     HELEN
                         He deserved it. He was born deserving 
                         it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         He treats you okay?

                                     HELEN
                         Okay.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I treated you better.

                                     HELEN
                         You treated me like shit.

               But she smiles.

                                     HELEN
                         You want some coffee?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.

                                     HELEN
                         What's wrong, Stephen?
                              (looks at her)
                         C'mon, you only beat up the roof 
                         when something's on your mind.
                              (beat)
                         How's Brian doing?

                                     STEPHEN
                         He's out.

                                     HELEN
                         I know he's out, but how's he doing?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Y'know, I treated him better than 
                         any other probie I ever had. He 
                         probably hates my guts, but I did 
                         the best thing for him. I made him 
                         finally look in the mirror.

                                     HELEN
                         Ah Stephen, that's what this is really 
                         about, isn't it? You always have to 
                         be right.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, I'm the first one to admit when 
                         I'm wrong.

                                     HELEN
                         Yeah? When was the last time?

                                     STEPHEN
                         In a fire? Never.
                              (beat)
                         Look, I'm his brother. I care about 
                         him, y'know? He was going to get 
                         himself killed. Maybe not today, 
                         maybe not in a year, but it would've 
                         happened. And I couldn't -- I just 
                         couldn't...

                                     HELEN
                         You can't keep being his father...

               Stephen sighs deeply.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You know what I realized today? I 
                         can't remember my dad's face anymore. 
                         There's pictures of him staring at 
                         me everywhere I go, but the guy behind 
                         them... he's gone...

               He sighs and hops down from the roof to the driveway.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll see ya around, Helen.

               She watches him as he walks lonely up the street.

               INT. CITY MORGUE - DAY

               A Lab Tech, RICCO, leads Brian and Rimgale through the autopsy 
               area till they come on two corpses lying side by side covered 
               in plastic.

                                     RICCO
                         Okay, Alan Seagrave and Donald 
                         Cosgrove...

               If you say so. Brian's stomach does a half-gainer as he's 
               confronted by two hideously charred bodies.

                                     RICCO
                         ...Both deaths due to close encounters 
                         with stationary objects; office door 
                         for Mr. Cosgrove, '89 Porsche for 
                         Mr. Seagrave. No non-relevant traumas. 
                         No significant blood toxicology. 
                         Attitude of both trajectories 
                         consistent with explosions.

               Brian is discreetly avoiding his gaze, whistling quietly to 
               himself as he looks over specimen jars on a shelf.

                                     RICCO
                         They ran the residue you scraped 
                         from both crispers' front doors. 
                         It's a combination of plumber's putty 
                         and rayophene gum. Burns almost 
                         completely away when you light it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Putty? On both doors?

                                     RICCO
                         There's something else kinda 
                         interesting...

               Ricco lifts Benton's charred shoulder. Underneath we see 
               some of his clothes that have melted and co-mingled with his 
               flesh.

                                     RICCO
                         See this?

               A credit card has been fried right into Cosgrove's skin about 
               where his back pocket should have been.

                                     RICCO
                         Guess he didn't leave home without 
                         it.

               Ricco erupts in a honking laugh, then switches instantly 
               back to a business tone.

                                     RICCO
                         Anyway, down here, take a look...

                                     SHADOW
                         McCaffrey, hold this for us.

                                     BRIAN
                         Uh, I don't think that's in my 
                         contract...

                                     SHADOW
                         I just re-wrote your contract. 
                         C'mere...

               With supreme reluctance Brian pulls the crisper's head and 
               shoulder away from the table.

                                     RICCO
                         Jesus Christ, he isn't gonna try to 
                         sell you insurance, lift him.

               Brian gathers the torso up and hoists him higher.

                                     RICCO
                              (to Rimgale)
                         See that patch of shirt? We wondered 
                         about the discoloration so he ran a 
                         spectro. On a lucky shot we picked 
                         up some traces of Trychticholorate. 
                         Nobody around here had ever heard of 
                         it.

                                     SHADOW
                         Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an 
                         absorption catalyst in toxic waste 
                         accidents. It's pretty rare, they 
                         stopped making it a couple'a years 
                         ago.

                                     RICCO
                         Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes 
                         in a gas state from the fire.

                                     SHADOW
                         What the hell was it doing in the 
                         fire?

                                     RICCO
                         That's your job.

               At that instant, Cosgrove's eyes OPEN and his body SIGHS. 
               Brian DROPS the body in shock and backs away, stunned.

                                     SHADOW
                         I asked you to hold him, not feel 
                         him up...

               INT. RIMGALE'S CAR - DAY

               Rimgale's FD sedan. Brian is still wringing imaginary guts 
               off his hands. Rimgale tosses an open fire chem book in his 
               lap.

                                     SHADOW
                         Read.

                                     BRIAN
                         "Trychtichlorate is a binary 
                         structured --"

                                     SHADOW
                         -- Go to the bottom. Under heat 
                         properties.

                                     BRIAN
                         "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin 
                         or higher, Trych breaks down and 
                         dissipates. Will consume magnesium".

                                     SHADOW
                         Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot 
                         it takes water molecules and BAMM!

               Rimgale CLAPS his hands next to Brian's head, STARTLING him.

                                     SHADOW
                         Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just 
                         to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take 
                         much at all to melt ten gauge wire. 
                         Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a 
                         powder trace -- unless you could 
                         find something that would eat its 
                         residue.

                                     BRIAN
                         Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can 
                         announce Seagrave was a murder.

               Rimgale looks at Brian. He's getting tired of this.

                                     SHADOW
                         Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone 
                         may have put the chemical in the 
                         outlet, but we found it as a vapor 
                         in Cosgrove's clothes.

                                     BRIAN
                         And the putty around the door?

                                     SHADOW
                         Even if it was used to seal the air 
                         off, that doesn't explain why someone 
                         would go to the trouble of a 
                         backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot 
                         easier

                                     BRIAN
                         But the right guess on this is arson.

                                     SHADOW
                         I don't guess.

                                     BRIAN
                         Some people say you don't do much of 
                         anything when it comes to this case.

                                     SHADOW
                         I don't work for them, either.

               INT. ARSON HQ - DAY

               Brian's sitting at a desk. He's finishing up a huge paper 
               clip Tyrannosaurus. The phone RINGS.

                                     BRIAN
                         Arson.

                         Straightest answer your department's 
                         given me all week.

               We see Jennifer's calling from her office, she's busy signing 
               papers brought to her and okaying campaign posters as she 
               talks.

                                     BRIAN

                                     BRIAN
                         Boss and I are up to about three 
                         words an hour.

                         There's another fund-raising party 
                         tonight. Marty'd really like you to 
                         come.

                                     BRIAN
                         I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.

               He tosses a paper airplane.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I could use a date.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...

                              (into phone)
                         Call ya back.

               Brian hangs up quickly and walks back into

               INT. ARSON HQ - ANOTHER ROOM - DAY

               Rimgale's there, crouched excitedly beside a trash can that's 
               lid's been sealed closed. He tamps a piece of putty on the 
               rim and backs away.

                                     SHADOW
                         Take the top off. Go ahead. Take it 
                         off.

               Brian walks over and RIPS OFF the lid. -- Instantly a tongue 
               of flame SHOOTS straight up past his head and BLOWS out.

                                     BRIAN
                         Jesus!

               Rimgale's grinning like a little kid.

                                     SHADOW
                         That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, 
                         he's different, goddamn it! You see 
                         what this tells us, huh? Our killer 
                         doesn't love fire!

                                     BRIAN
                         What?

                                     SHADOW
                              (pulls out file)
                         I got it after we talked to Ronald. 
                         Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn 
                         world. But the fires that killed 
                         those guys never really burned up 
                         much. -- The burns were all lit in 
                         outlets surrounded by double 
                         firebreaks in the walls. And he made 
                         his burns backdrafts.
                              ([p. 78])

                                     BRIAN
                         But he killed these guys.

                                     SHADOW
                         But he could have killed everybody 
                         there. The firebreaks kept it from 
                         spreading in the wall. The backdraft 
                         blew out the flame. That's it. That's 
                         the reason.

                                     BRIAN
                         What reason?

                                     SHADOW
                         Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave 
                         and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot 
                         of trouble to make sure they died by 
                         fire, but also made sure the fire 
                         blew itself out.

                                     BRIAN
                         That's why the sealant on the doors... 
                         So what have we got, a torch with a 
                         conscience?

                                     SHADOW
                         No, we have a stone killer trying to 
                         make a point.

                                     BRIAN
                         Are you going public with this?

                                     SHADOW
                         No. Do that and I guarantee you'll 
                         scare him off. I don't want him 
                         running away.

               EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

               A Latin band cuts loose as beautiful people mill about against 
               a beautiful Chicago skyline. An AIR HORN blows, and suddenly 
               the skyline is MOVING. We're on a huge, private party boat.

               EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

               Brian's leaning on the boat railing watching the passing 
               parade of rich and beautiful. Across the sea of champagne 
               and brie, he spots Jennifer talking with her boss, Swayzak. 
               He has his hand on her back.

               Jennifer spots Brian. She smile, detaches herself and walks 
               over.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Hi.

                                     BRIAN
                              (eyes on Swayzak)
                         Hey...
                              (beat)
                         So are you dating your boss or what?

                                     JENNIFER
                         If you weren't at least the 300th 
                         person to ask me that, I'd probably 
                         be pissed.
                              (beat, sighs)
                         Boy, you sure know it's a man's world 
                         sometimes...

                                     BRIAN
                         Sorry.
                              (beat)
                         Are you dating anyone?

                                     JENNIFER
                         You think that's really any of your 
                         business?

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, you did invite me here.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Marty did.
                              (beat, smiles)
                         But I wanted you to come to.

               Swayzak suddenly appears with his entourage.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Mr. McCaffrey...

                                     BRIAN
                         Nice boat.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         It isn't mine.
                              (to photographer)
                         Let's get a picture.

               Swayzak swings around and puts his arm cheesily around Brian's 
               shoulder. Another staffer slaps a SWAYZAK FOR MAYOR sticker 
               to Brian's lapel. Jennifer rolls her eyes to Brian. I'm 
               sorry... Snap.

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (seeing someone else)
                         Larry!
                              (sotto to Jennifer)
                         What does he do again?

               Swayzak leads her off in pursuit. Left alone, Brian turns to 
               the railing, stares off at the passing city. You can hear 
               the wind-up of a siren.

               And there it is now, an engine company zooming along Wacker 
               Drive. Something digs and kicks inside of Brian as he watches 
               it disappear.

                                     JENNIFER
                         How's the job going?

               She's appeared again beside him.

                                     BRIAN
                         Okay.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, 
                         isn't he?

                                     BRIAN
                         No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's 
                         not a dummy, though. He's juggling 
                         alot of balls on this one.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert 
                         Einstein just to figure out if these 
                         guys were killed by accidents or 
                         not.

                                     BRIAN
                         Jesus, give him a break. There isn't 
                         enough proof yet to go public. Sure, 
                         we found some chemical shit we think 
                         somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 
                         'em, and we've maybe figured out why 
                         backdrafts, but you can't rush this 
                         stuff. Not 'till it's locked.

                                     JENNIFER
                         But Rimgale's probably going to come 
                         around to arson.

                                     BRIAN
                         In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.

               BAMM!

               Both of them look up sharply. A woman drunk out of her mind 
               has tipped over in her chair. She laughs, her fellow 
               tablemates laugh, everybody laughs. Jennifer takes Brian by 
               the arm in the opposite direction and smiles.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Save me.

               EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

               The band's completely cut loose now. A wild percussion rhythm 
               that has everyone on their feet dancing like madmen. Brian 
               and Jennifer stomp and sweat and shake and giggle through 
               hair crazily askew. The lakeshore is twinkling and wonderful 
               as it slips past. The drums beat faster and harder and the 
               only thing that isn't moving now is their eyes -- eyes locked 
               on each other.

               EXT. ARSON HQ - NIGHT

               Sweaty, flushed with the evening and a few drinks, Brian and 
               Jennifer pull up in her car.

                                     BRIAN
                         Thanks for the invite.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Got anything to drink in there?

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, there might be something stashed 
                         away for emergencies.

               INT. ARSON HQ/FIRE STATION

               The regular engine company's gone to bed and the arson squad's 
               packed in for the night, leaving the apparatus floor quiet 
               and dim as Brian and Jennifer enter.

               Brian leads her back past the engine and arson sedan to the 
               rear where Rimgale has his offices. As they walk Jennifer's 
               eyes drift up to the old sculpted parapets, the press-tin 
               ceiling.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is one of the oldest fire 
                         stations in the city. Lotta tradition 
                         locked up in here. What do you think?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Homey.

                                     BRIAN
                         See that trap door up there? That 
                         used to lead to the hay loft when 
                         they had horse-drawn engines. It was 
                         pretty different then... but kinda 
                         the same, y'know?

                                     JENNIFER
                         Do you miss it?
                              (he doesn't answer)
                         You seem like you do.

                                     BRIAN
                         When I came back, I knew more than 
                         anything else that I wanted to be a 
                         fireman.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Then why did you quit?

                                     BRIAN
                         I wanted to be a good one.

               INT. ARSON HQ - BACK OFFICES

               They walk into the back arson offices. Brian pokes through a 
               few drawers, one or two shelves. Finally he lifts a squat, 
               specialized fire extinguisher. The bottom has been hollowed 
               out, leaving room for a fifth of bourbon.

                                     BRIAN
                         Old firehouse trick.

               He pours her a glass. Jennifer takes a generous sip of her's, 
               turns, brushes past him and breathes,

                                     JENNIFER
                         So show me your fire truck.

               INT. ARSON HQ - APPARATUS FLOOR

               Brian escorts Jennifer along the side of the behemoth.

                                     BRIAN
                         Well, our specimen here is your basic 
                         standard issue piece of primary 
                         suppression equipment. This area is 
                         the pumping panel, which controls 
                         the rate of liquid insertion into 
                         the hose.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Uh huh.

               Brian lifts a narrow, tapered straight-bore nozzle.

                                     BRIAN
                         This is a six inch playpipe, cast 
                         bronze to keep it firm during hard 
                         flows.
                              (picks up another 
                              item)
                         This is our pipe extender, used in 
                         forward lays...
                              (moves on)
                         This is our hard suction line... Our 
                         adjustable insertion nozzle...
                              (comes around back of 
                              trunk)
                         ...And this is the hose bed.

               Beat. The air cracks between them. And is brushed aside. In 
               an instant they're all over each other. Tangled lips and 
               gulping breaths. Jennifer abruptly breaks it off

               -- And looks mischievously up at the hose bed, with its long 
               curling rolls of soft cotton.

               Brian doesn't remember this precise scenario being discussed 
               at the academy, but he improvises admirably, popping up onto

               EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

               Engine 17 roars up, lights flashing, to a high-rise. As the 
               crew jumps down Tim trips and falls flat on his face.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Jesus Tim, if you're going to kill 
                         yourself at least wait till the fire, 
                         it's better P.R.

               INT. ARSON HQ - HOSE BED - NIGHT

               Jennifer unbuttons Brian's shirt.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Tell me about the playpipe again...

               She pulls the shirt off his shoulder as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HIGH-RISE - LOBBY - NIGHT

               Engine 17 walking up to a frazzled security guard in the 
               lobby.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Where is it?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Don't know. There's alarms going off 
                         on three different floors.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Wonderful.

               They climb into the elevator.

               INT. HIGH RISE - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               It's cramped on the way up with the bulky coats, helmets, 
               hose rolls, and the tangible nervousness that always goes 
               with this kind of fire. The elevator Musak plays 101 Strings 
               version of "Tie A Yellow Ribbon 'Round The Old Oak Tree".

                                     TIM
                         How do we know if the floor's going 
                         to be on fire?

                                     STEPHEN
                         If the doors open and it's hot, don't 
                         get out.

               INT. ARSON HQ - HOSE BED

               Brian pulls off Jennifer's stockings. As she kicks it away...

               INT. HIGH-RISE - UPPER FLOOR - NIGHT

               The elevator stops. DING. The door opens. No howling blaze, 
               not even any noise, but enough hanging smoke that you can't 
               see your hand in front of your face.

               They fan out gingerly onto the floor, looking for the fire. 
               Hide and seek in a white fog bank. Everybody stops and 
               listens. Slowly, carefully, they feel their way through the 
               haze.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It's here.

               On cue something snakes past behind the walls, whispers and 
               whines and shivers up and over them and then is silent. 
               Grindle attaches a hoseline to the building standpipe.

                                     GRINDLE
                         These high-rise gigs give me the 
                         creeps.

                                     AXE
                         Let's wait for a back-up, Stephen. 
                         We're early on this one, it hasn't 
                         even broke out yet. We're one short 
                         as it is with Brian gone.

               But Stephen's on the hunt now. Obsessed.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Want to learn something?

                                     TIM
                         Yes sir!

               Stephen and Tim take the lead, their axes gripped like 
               shotguns. Grindle backs them up with a charged hoseline.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Adcox, go with Pengelly and check 
                         the other side.

                                     AXE
                         It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' 
                         us up. Not with this one.

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- What the hell's the matter with 
                         you? You always check the other side. 
                         I haven't got time for bullshit right 
                         now, okay? We got a job here.

                                     AXE
                         Let me take the lead, Stephen...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking 
                         job!

               Adcox folds. With a stricken look on his face he takes his 
               crew down the other way. Stephen and Tim slowly feel their 
               way.

               CRACK

               Everybody SPINS around in terror. Nothing. Something inhuman 
               giggles down ahead of them. Stephen smiles.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (like a mantra)
                         Oh, you're so very sly, but so am 
                         I...
                              (to Tim)
                         ...Listen to it... you can tell when 
                         a wall cracks which way it's gonna 
                         jump... you can hear the doors breathe 
                         if they're hot...

               Tim looks confused. He doesn't get it.

               They come to a side door. Stephen runs his hand down the 
               jam, feels for heat. Then he steps back, takes a deep breath, 
               and CRASHES the door down with one AXE BLOW. Quiet inside.

               INT. ARSON HQ - HOSE BED - NIGHT

               Brian and Jennifer are into the rhythm now, breathing deeply. 
               On the wall above them are framed photos of dead firemen. 
               Watching.

               INT. HIGH-RISE - SECOND DOORWAY - NIGHT

               Stephen concentrates on the sound of the fire above him, --
               then abruptly turns and CRASHES down another door.

               INT. ARSON HQ - ALARM KLAXON GOES OFF - NIGHT

               Brian and Jennifer lie in a tight embrace, enjoying the 
               moment, the lull, as suddenly the lights SNAP ON and an alarm 
               klaxon BELLOWS. Firemen are coming down the pole now.

                                     JENNIFER
                         What's going on?

               They frantically climb into their clothes. The firemen haven't 
               noticed them as they climb aboard. They've STARTED THE ENGINE.

                                     JENNIFER
                         What are they doing?

               EXT. ARSON HQ - STREETS - NIGHT

               And before either of them realizes it, they're suddenly 
               pulling out into the street and WAILING off down the block. 
               The wind's wild in their hair, the siren deafening, the 
               flashing red lights blinding staccato, And Jennifer loves 
               it. She kisses Brian fiercely, he lets out a war whoop lost 
               in the blast of air, and together they hold each other as 
               the night screams past and...

               EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

               Engine 17 pulls up into the parking lot of the high-rise 
               fire. Firemen leap out of the cab and rush around behind to 
               pull off lengths of hose from the bed. As the folds curl 
               away the fireman is stunned to see a woman's stocking come 
               out with it.

               With equal shock he looks up and watches as a disheveled and 
               grinning Brian and Jennifer climb calmly down out of the 
               bed.

                                     BRIAN
                         Excuse us.

               INT. HIGH-RISE - TIM'S DOOR - NIGHT

               Stephen and Tim creep along the hall.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Tim)
                         Lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling... 
                         that means it's hiding... staying 
                         sleepy... one of these doors...

               Tim's come to one.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to himself)
                         Easy... no hurry... you're not going 
                         anywhere...

               Stephen BANGS down another door. Sticks his head in to check. 
               A little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water.

               Tim readies his axe before his door, gathers his courage as 
               Stephen comes out of the room he was checking. Sees Tim 
               lifting his axe.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Did you check the door for heat, 
                         Tim?

               Tim doesn't hear. The axe is already up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim?

               Tim's committed now, coming hard at the door. And Stephen 
               sees it for just an instant -- Small tendrils of smoke edging 
               lazily around the door -- then being sucked back in.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim!

               He rushes for Tim as Tim's axe SMACKS the door and a whine 
               behind it builds and roars and howls and Tim's all follow-
               through now, hitting the door with his shoulder as 

               The door EXPLODES OUTWARD, HURLING TIM against the opposite 
               wall and for an instant he's okay but he freezes in terror 
               as A SHRIEKING TONGUE OF FLAME SHOOTS OUT THE DOORWAY and 
               Grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames 
               wrap Tim like a jealous lover as Adcox hears it and screams,

                                     AXE
                         Oh God! Oh God no!

               And Tim's screaming now too, because his helmet, his mask, 
               his face, it's all melting and Grindle dives suicidally at 
               the monster, BLASTING it with his hose as Stephen ignores 
               the flames and puts his arms around Tim as Grindle DOUSES 
               them both, killing the flames.

               The monster rolls wounded back into the room, into the air 
               shafts as Tim whimpers incoherently, sliding down the wall 
               as Stephen tries to help but oh God you can't tell what's 
               face and what's mask and helmet anymore.

               Grindle looks back where the fire came from. There's a corpse 
               in there, burned and lying between two doors.

               Adcox rushes to Tim's side sobbing and it's the end, the end 
               of the goddamn world...

               EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

               Brian and Jennifer are having the time of their lives, when 
               suddenly a group of firemen pass by rushing someone on a 
               stretcher to an ambulance and Brian sees -- sweet Jesus -- 
               it's Tim. Jennifer turns away in horror. They load Tim into 
               the van as Adcox and Grindle jump in to ride along. To hold 
               his hand.

               Stephen watches the ambulance disappear out into the street. 
               Frustration and fury tear at him as he takes off his coat 
               and slams it to the ground. He kicks it, kicks it till his 
               strength's gone. He turns, his wounded eyes finding Brian.

               INT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

               Rimgale walks down the smokey corridor. The charred civilian 
               is there, sitting in the short stretch of hall between two 
               blown doors. Through the haze Rimgale sees Stephen crouched 
               in the interior room, picking at the debris. Lost in himself.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, Stevie.

               Stephen stands and looks around the room, seemingly unaware 
               of Rimgale. He walks wordlessly straight out past him, his 
               eyes streaming with tears.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

               Brian shoulders his way through the emergency room. He passes 
               a small alcove full of vending machines. Adcox is there, 
               sipping a paper cup, leaning against the machine in deep 
               anguish.

                                     BRIAN
                         Is he...

                                     AXE
                         He's alive.

               INT. HOSPITAL ICU - NIGHT

               Further down the hall is ICU. Grindle and Santos are there, 
               sitting outside the room, raw and weary. Grindle nods to 
               Brian. Everyone's still stained and smudged from the fire.

               Everyone but Brian.

               Brian looks through a door window into the room. There, 
               surrounded by doctors and physicians, lies Tim. He's been 
               cut out of his uniform. Gauze bandages everywhere. As a pair 
               of forceps peel some away Brian glimpses what used to be a 
               face, now only reds and browns and leaky whites. He turns 
               away.

                                     BRIAN
                         Do they think he'll pull through?

                                     GRINDLE
                         They're not saying.

                                     BRIAN
                         I should have been there.

                                     NIGHTENGALE
                         None of us should have been there, 
                         Brian.

               Voices rise down the hall. Turn to shouts. It's Adcox and 
               Stephen, tearing heartbreakingly into one another. Brian 
               can't make out the words but it's ugly, emotional. Abruptly 
               it ends and Stephen emerges from the alcove, walking toward 
               them upset.

                                     BRIAN
                         You had to do it, didn't you?

               Stephen's got other things on his mind.

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...Not now, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Had to take on another fire bare-
                         handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth 
                         man in there instead of looking out 
                         for your probie. Is that what 
                         happened? Is it, Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I had that fire. He didn't listen!

                                     BRIAN
                         He didn't listen? He was a fucking 
                         candidate! He was your responsibility. 
                         He shouldn't have been there in the 
                         first place, Stephen.
                              (beat)
                         You burned him.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fuck you.

               Brian grabs his arm.

               Stephen SNAPS and roughly PUSHES Brian, knocking him against 
               the wall. Brian comes off it in a flash and is all over 
               Stephen. They go down and it's all thrashing and shouting 
               now. A horrible, endless draw. Grindle and Santos are in it, 
               pulling them apart, holding them up against opposite walls.

               Both brothers glare at one another, tears filling their eyes. 
               Brian shakes Grindle off and walks away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ARSON HQ - BRIAN'S DESK - MORNING

               Brian sits staring blankly. A newspaper drops in front of 
               him. FIRE DEPT. SAYS IT'S MURDER. Rimgale stands above him.

                                     SHADOW
                         Goes on about how the break was made 
                         through the discovery of "chemical 
                         traces" and a "behavioral link". Oh, 
                         and Swayzak's quoted saying the chief 
                         investigator is closing in on the 
                         torch and expects an arrest "any 
                         time".

               Brian's eyes wince closed.

                                     SHADOW
                         Get your stuff and get out.

               INT. JENNIFER'S OFFICE - DAY

               She's pouring some coffee as Brian bursts in.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (surprised)
                         Brian. What's wrong?

                                     BRIAN
                         You told Swayzak about our arson 
                         lead. It's all over the fucking news.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I didn't know it was a secret. There 
                         aren't supposed to be secrets between 
                         the city and its investigators --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- Bullshit! You knew what I told 
                         you wasn't ready for the papers --

                                     JENNIFER
                         Will you please keep your voice down, 
                         there's people --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- You could have scared the son of 
                         a bitch off. We may never bust him 
                         now. All for a couple's political 
                         points.

                                     JENNIFER
                         I was doing my job.

                                     BRIAN
                              (grabs her arm)
                         Yeah? And just how much of all this 
                         has been "doing your job"?

                                     JENNIFER
                              (shakes it off)
                         Let me ask you something, do you 
                         really think Marty had you assigned 
                         to arson because of your firefighting 
                         skills? Who the hell are you kidding? 
                         I was there, remember? I saw you and 
                         your brother --

                                     BRIAN
                         Leave Stephen out of this --

                                     JENNIFER
                         Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.
                              (beat)
                         Who are you? Just another probie 
                         working for Swayzak --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- I work for the city.

                                     JENNIFER
                         You knew what we were asking you to 
                         do. Don't suddenly pull out a 
                         conscience now. The fit isn't right.

               Swayzak appears in the doorway. He looks haggard, as if he 
               hasn't slept. There's something haunted in his eyes.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a 
                         letter to the Times explaining how 
                         yesterday's arson announcement was a 
                         fabrication by your office. They 
                         loved it. And you know what? You 
                         were right, my family background in 
                         firefighting gave it weight.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Oh Brian...

               Brian shoulders his way past Swayzak and walks out.

               INT. HOSPITAL - TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Brian walks up to Tim's room. Stephen's sitting there, ragged 
               looking. Inside the young probie lies wrapped in tubes and 
               gauze and years of wasted promise. An EKG beeps, a respirator 
               hisses, and Brian gulps down something heavy in his throat.

                                     STEPHEN
                         He's gonna live. Maybe not much else, 
                         but he's gonna live...

               Stephen walks away.

               EXT. ARSON HQ - MORNING

               As Rimgale gets out of his car a limousine pulls up. Swayzak 
               opens the rear door from inside.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Inspector.

                                     SHADOW
                         Alderman.

               INT. SWAYZAK SEDAN - DAY

               Cruising through traffic. Swayzak is disheveled, unshaven, 
               fidgety. A man who hasn't slept and had a few drinks before 
               the one he's pouring now. He offers one to Rimgale.

                                     SHADOW
                         I usually have breakfast first.

               Swayzak apparently doesn't.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         When are you going to catch the prick 
                         that's doing this, Don?

                                     SHADOW
                         "Don?"

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Don't you have any leads at all?

                                     SHADOW
                         No Marty, I don't.

               For the first time, Rimgale sees real fear on Swayzak's face.

                                     SHADOW
                         We still haven't found a connection 
                         between the victims.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, 
                         Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried 
                         in a goddamn high-rise!

                                     SHADOW
                         Holcomb? I didn't know the name of 
                         that victim had even been released 
                         yet.

               The sedan stops back at arson HQ. They'd gone around the 
               block.

               EXT. ARSON HQ - SWAYZAK SEDAN - DAY

               Rimgale opens the door, climbs out, lingers.

                                     SHADOW
                         Is there a connection between them, 
                         Alderman?

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Just catch the son of a bitch.

               The door shuts and Swayzak roars away.

               INT. ARSON HQ - BACK OFFICES - DAY

               Rimgale walks back into his offices. He's surprised to see 
               Brian there working at his desk.

                                     SHADOW
                         What the hell are you doing here?

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do 
                         whatever you want me to do. I just 
                         want to help catch the guy that burned 
                         Tim. You gotta give me another shot.

               Rimgale stares at Brian, appraises him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HIGH-RISE

               A CLOSE UP of Rimgale POPPING the molding around the door 
               frame of Holcomb's burned office. Underneath can be seen 
               traces of the same white residue from the other fires.

                                     SHADOW
                         I thought 'ol Marty was acting a 
                         little strange... And he's right.

               Rimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers.

                                     BRIAN
                         Backdraft?

               Rimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body 
               lied between two doors.

                                     SHADOW
                         The backdraft was set somewhere in 
                         there. It fried Holcomb when he opened 
                         the inner door. But the outer door 
                         held... and waited for Tim...

               Brian steps into the inner office.

                                     SHADOW
                         So find me the fire.

               Brian begins searching, probing. He finally stands. Defeated.

                                     SHADOW
                         You're thinking too much of the 
                         building and not enough of the ghost.

               Brian's eyes don't understand. From Rimgale's coat comes a 
               plastic flask. He pours out of it a liquid onto the floor 
               and lights a match.

                                     SHADOW
                         In a word, Brian, what is this job 
                         all about?

                                     BRIAN
                         Fire.

               Rimgale drops the match.

               WUMP. A small flame explodes to life.

                                     SHADOW
                         It's a living thing, Brian. It 
                         breathes, it eats, and it hates.

               The fire's climbing a wall, chewing a corner.

                                     SHADOW
                         The only way to beat it is to think 
                         like it. To know that this flame 
                         will spread this way across the floor 
                         not because of the physics of 
                         flammable liquids or heat convection, 
                         but because it wants to.

               FWUMP. It darts west. Licks the ceiling. The fire purrs and 
               hisses. Stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely.

                                     SHADOW
                         Some guys on this job, fire owns 
                         them. It makes them fight on its 
                         level. But the only way to truly 
                         kill it is to love it a little, just 
                         like Ronald.

               Brian stares at the flame. A goblin reaching out for him... --
               Woosh! Rimgale hits it with a fire extinguisher. In an instant 
               the goblin is gone, the genie in the bottle.

                                     VOICE
                         What the hell are you guys doin'?

               A young woman's entered.

                                     SHADOW
                         We're the fire department, lady.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well color me stupid, I always thought 
                         the fire dept. put out fires.

                                     SHADOW
                              (to woman)
                         You work here?

                                     WOMAN
                         Till yesterday. What do you think 
                         the odds are that a non-refundable 
                         ticket to Paris survived this?

                                     BRIAN
                         Somewhere between zero and no way.

                                     WOMAN
                         Shit. What a mess.

                         Jeff Holcomb? The Darth Vader of tax

                         Hopefully a sleezeball that carried 
                         some insurance.

                         He was the building owner.

                         Our book lists the owner as Dekom

               week.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - STEPHEN'S STATION OFFICE - DAY

               Stephen's lying sprawled on his bunk, his hands pressed over 
               his eyes. There's a voice outside the door.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm busy.

                                     GRINDLE
                         He just wants to --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?

               A beat, then Rimgale himself enters.

                                     STEPHEN
                         What, they don't knock on your planet?

               Rimgale takes in Stephen's room, the half empty bourbon 
               bottle. Without a word, Rimgale walks over and pours it out. 
               He sits down beside Stephen.

                                     SHADOW
                         I still haven't gotten your fire 
                         report, Stevie. On Tim.

               A wave of pain rolls through Stephen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm working on it.

                         I deal with this stuff every day. 
                         But a fireman... you never get used 
                         to it.
                              (beat)
                         What happened up there? He was a 
                         candidate. Did he pay attention? Was 
                         he listening?

                                     STEPHEN
                         ...He wasn't listening to the right 
                         thing...

                                     SHADOW
                         What do you listen to, Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         You don't know... nobody knows...

                                     SHADOW
                         I might.

               Stephen's eyes meet Rimgale's and hold.

                                     STEPHEN
                         It knows us. This one knows us.

                                     SHADOW
                              (beat)
                         I need that report, Lt.

               Stephen takes Rimgale's notebook out of his lap, rips out a 
               page, and writes angrily in huge block letters.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Tim-went-to-the-fire-and-now-he-
                         doesn't-have-a-face.

               Stephen throws the sheet at Rimgale, stands, and walks out.

               INT. HALL OF RECORDS

               An Escher drawing of a place, endlessly vast racks spun around 
               an open central core. High up, lost among its rows, Brian is 
               going through rack after rack of dog-eared record books as 
               Rimgale enters down below.

                         laundered money for the mob before

                         very high on Seagrave, either.

               A beat, then he looks directly at Brian.

               With glowing skyscrapers leaping up in the background, it's 
               an unexpectedly quiet, serene place along the lake. Jennifer 
               sits alone at a bench, watching an ancient fisherman look 
               for dinner, as Brian walks up.

                         You could check. It'd be in his files.

                         Y'know, four years ago I was working 
                         in a bakery. Two years ago I was 
                         bringing Marty coffee and he didn't 
                         even know my name. I run that office 
                         now. Marty believed in me and I 
                         believe in him. You want me to just 
                         throw that away?

               And it hangs between them, two people lonely on the edge of 
               the lake.

               At a workbench, under a single lamp, Stephen stands amongst 
               a confusion of tools, wire, And a wall socket.

               With a pair of pliers, he tugs at something within the socket, 
               puts the face-plate back on and screws it down. He stares at 
               it, and we feel the sudden wave of hopelessness cascading 
               through him.

               He sets the socket back down -- and SCATTERS everything aside 
               in a single, furious move.

                         Stephen?

               She sits down beside him.

                         I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...

                         What's wrong?

                         It used to be, when I was a kid,

                         was there were no ifs. Life and death, 
                         right and wrong. When someone called 
                         the fire department, we came... Those 
                         guys don't know how much I love 
                         them... You don't leave people 
                         hanging... cause that's what it's 
                         all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till 
                         death do us part. Isn't that what 
                         you heard?... It's you go, we go... 
                         Cause without that, it's the end of 
                         families, it's the end of the fire 
                         department... and when the fire 
                         department stops coming... that's 
                         the end of the fucking world...

               Morning, and Stephen dressed, making eggs for three. Sean's 
               there, lending a hand, beaming as Stephen tries to show him 
               how to flip an egg. Helen enters in her robe. He kisses her.

                         Cook and I are almost finished here. 
                         Have a seat.

                         Stephen... I... can I talk to you a 
                         second...

               Stephen musses his son's hair and follows her out into the 
               hall.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Look, I'm sorry I --

                                     HELEN
                         -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. 
                         And y'know, he told me he actually 
                         likes the piano.

                                     HELEN
                         I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.

               The blow's so long and hard and deep you don't even see it.

                                     HELEN
                         It's... It's just things have 
                         changed... you're the same, Stephen, 
                         but things are different now... you've 
                         got a son... you're the best at what 
                         you do Stephen, you always were, but 
                         you scare me now...

               Just then, Sean sticks his head into it.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Sean)
                         Hey... Sean-man, your dad blew it. I 
                         forgot I had to work this morning...

                                     SEAN
                         Aw dad, c'mon...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Next time, huh? We'll do it up big. 
                         Promise.

               Helen's turned away.

                                     SEAN
                         Okay.
                              (then sotto)
                         Mom's crying, dad.

               INT. SWAYZAK'S OFFICE - CITY HALL - MORNING

               Jennifer enters Swayzak's inner office. His chair's turned 
               away toward the window.

                                     JENNIFER
                              (holding print-out)
                         Latest polls came in, Marty.
                              (he doesn't answer)
                         Marty?

               Finally the chair turns, revealing a haunted man. Polls are 
               far from his mind.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Jesus Christ, Marty, what's going 
                         on?

                                     SWAYZAK
                         Leave me alone.

               She sees a fire department file on the murders open on his 
               desk.

                                     JENNIFER
                         We've come a long way together, Marty. 
                         I've staked my whole career on you. 
                         And now you're sneaking around this 
                         office, leaking things to the papers 
                         behind my back...
                              (beat)
                         Is there something you're not telling 
                         me about these deaths?

               Swayzak's eyes are dead metal.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         No.

               And he turns his chair around again. Jennifer stands there a 
               beat. -- Then turns to the filing cabinets.

               EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Brian drives up and parks. He's half way to the staircase 
               when he sees someone sitting in the dark in a car.

                                     BRIAN
                         Jennifer?

               She hands him a manila envelope.

                                     BRIAN
                         What is --

                                     JENNIFER
                         Just take it.

               Silence.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JENNIFER
                         That's a dumb thing to say.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're right.

               She starts her car.

                                     JENNIFER
                         Goodbye, Brian.

               INT. FIRE DEPARTMENT REPAIR DEPOT

               A cavernous hall full of dozens of fire trucks loaded on 
               jacks. Rimgale's sedan's there, the repairman shaking his 
               head in amazement at the undercarriage.

                                     REPAIRMAN
                         What the hell do you do with this 
                         thing?

               Rimgale's looking through the report Brian's handed him.

                                     SHADOW
                         This is the copy of Swayzak's manning 
                         report that was released. Everybody 
                         on this job knows it's bullshit but 
                         we could never argue with the numbers. 
                         They're all airtight.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah? Airtight?

               He dumps three more reports on Rimgale.

                                     BRIAN
                         I've got three different drafts of 
                         the same report -- with different 
                         numbers that're all over the place. 
                         Looks like they were just making it 
                         up as they went along.

                                     SHADOW
                         Did a little check on the consulting 
                         firm that wrote the report. They did 
                         exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower 
                         study. It's not even really a company. 
                         No employees, no directors, just a 
                         PO Box.

                                     BRIAN
                         Then who wrote the report?

                                     SHADOW
                         It had to be someone who knows 
                         numbers. Some kind of fancy 
                         accountant. But what's the connection?

               Brian hands him something else. A photograph. Swayzak and 
               the other three, posing on a fishing boat, 1970. Time of 
               their lives.

                                     SHADOW
                         I think it's time Mr. Swayzak and us 
                         had a little heart to heart talk.

               EXT. SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home. Rimgale and 
               Brian walk up and knock on the door -- it creaks open ajar. 
               They push the door open slowly.

               INT. SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               It's dark as they enter.

                                     SHADOW
                         Hello? Swayzak?

               Brian and Rimgale split up down different halls. It's the 
               HISS Brian hears first. Then the FLASH of an electrical socket 
               FLARING ice-cold cobalt blue. Suddenly the room's dimensions 
               are there in frantic, strobing shadows. Chairs, a couch --

               -- And a figure that JUMPS Brian. the light from the burning 
               plug is a fierce strobe as the figure, a confused shadow, 
               crashes Brian to the floor. They STRUGGLE.

               The figure GRABS Brian's throat. Brian PUSHES him back

               -- Against the burning wall plug. The figure SHRIEKS in pain, 
               gets his hand on a crowbar and SLAMS Brian -- who crumples, 
               dazed. The figure stands -- just as Rimgale TACKLES him. The 
               figure CRASHES across a gas space heater, SNAPPING the 
               connection off. The figure SLAMS Rimgale HARD with the 
               crowbar, squirms free, and stumbles out the door.

               Hissss... Rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the 
               wall. A baby backdraft wagging its tail. He goes to a dazed 
               Brian's side, lifting him by his armpits and

               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT

               helping him outside. Hissss... The ruptured space heater 
               pumps gas furiously. Rimgale sees that. He also sees a bedroom 
               door ajar on the far side of the house. And through the door 
               a couch. And on the couch, A body. Hissss...

               INT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT

               Rimgale rushes back inside. It's Swayzak, unconscious.

               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT

               Rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside Brian just as the 
               gas WHUMPS and the doors and windows EXPLODE in a HOWLING 
               FIREBALL, the shrapnel BLOWING Rimgale off his feet. Brian 
               slowly shakes his head clear. He looks around, tries to orient 
               himself.

                                     SHADOW
                         Uh... I sorta got a problem here...

               Brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where Rimgale 
               lies at a weird angle, a piece of wrought iron fence punched 
               through his shoulder.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

               Rimgale lies in an emergency room bed.

                                     SHADOW
                         Well Brian, I guess you can say it's 
                         arson now...

                                     BRIAN
                         How ya feeling?

               Rimgale grunts.

                                     BRIAN
                         Did you pull me out?

                                     SHADOW
                         Yeah.

                                     BRIAN
                         Did I say thanks?

                                     SHADOW
                         No.

                                     BRIAN
                         Just wondering.

                                     SHADOW
                         I hate hospitals. You're so... so 
                         goddamn useless...

               Rimgale suddenly kicks the bed frame in anger. He kicks it 
               over and over with frustration till something finally SNAPS 
               off. Brian waits, let's him vent his frustration.

                                     BRIAN
                         So what do you want me to do?

                                     SHADOW
                         I've been lying here hours... just 
                         thinking... We're close...
                              (beat)
                         We're not looking in the right place, 
                         Brian. This one knows us and we're 
                         not looking in the right place...

               INT. PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

               Brian's sitting alone in a chair. Finally the opposite door 
               opens and in enters Ronald.

                                     RONALD
                         Well, Mr. Life magazine. Come all 
                         this way just to say hi?

               Brian hands him a stack of murder files.

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm close... but I can't get who it 
                         is...

                                     RONALD
                         So you came to me...
                              (smiles)
                         Well, this is going to be an 
                         interesting afternoon after all...

               As Ronald starts to read the files

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PRISON INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY

               Brian still sitting there. Watching Ronald devour the 
               statistics. The photos of charred bodies. Ronald finishes, 
               leans back.

                                     RONALD
                         Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you 
                         a story, you tell me one. Fair?

                                     BRIAN
                         Who's doing this?

                                     RONALD
                         Your first question should be who 
                         isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not 
                         enough damage. And an insurance pro? 
                         Where's the profit margin?

                                     BRIAN
                         Then who --

                                     RONALD
                         -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.

                                     BRIAN
                         I don't have a story.

                                     RONALD
                         Sure you do.

               Ronald drops on the table a dog-eared copy of that 1972 LIFE 
               magazine with Brian on the cover.

                                     RONALD
                         Famous story even. Straight burn. 
                         Just an engine and truck first on 
                         scene. What did you feel, Brian, 
                         when you first got there?

                                     BRIAN
                         What?

                                     RONALD
                         You gotta tell a story too, Brian. 
                         It's fair. C'mon, don't think too 
                         hard --

                                     BRIAN
                         I... I thought it was great. I loved 
                         it. It was nothing to these guys... 
                         medium deal.

                                     RONALD
                         Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a 
                         civilians hollering -- medium deal. 
                         So young fireman Adcox and Captain 
                         McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get 
                         out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey 
                         does the ballsy jump across... what 
                         were you feeling, Brian?
                              (Brian doesn't answer)
                         C'mon, you promised. Be honest.
                              (Brian just stares)
                         Okay... Guard!

                                     BRIAN
                         -- I wanted to be him. Right then I 
                         wanted to be him more than anything...

                                     RONALD
                              (smiles)
                         Very good, Brian. -- About your report 
                         here. The way to a torch's heart is 
                         through his tools. That's how you 
                         know him. It's the way he talks to 
                         the fire. And to you if you listen.

                                     BRIAN
                         The outlets.

                                     RONALD
                         That's a probie answer. You're smarter 
                         than that, Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Trychticholorate.

                                     RONALD
                         Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox 
                         and McCaffrey, they go back inside. 
                         Only there's another fire in there 
                         nobody sees. And it took your dad, 
                         didn't it Brian? Did you see him 
                         burn?

               In a flash, Brian suddenly reaches across and grabs Ronald 
               by the collar.

                                     BRIAN
                         Who the fuck is doing this?

                                     RONALD
                         After it took your dad... the fire... 
                         did it look at you Brian? Did it 
                         talk to you?...

               And Ronald sees something in Brian's eyes. He smiles.

                                     RONALD
                         You see, our world's aren't so 
                         different...

               Brian releases Ronald.

                                     BRIAN
                              (quiet)
                         Who's doing this?

               The arsonist smiles a creepy, horrible grin.

                                     RONALD
                         Think, Brian. Who doesn't love fire, 
                         but knows it better than anyone else? 
                         Who's around trychticholorate 24 
                         hours a day?

               A cold shock rolls through Brian as he slumps back in his 
               chair.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh Jesus Christ...

                                     RONALD
                         Not such a far walk after all, is 
                         it, Brian?

               EXT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - MARINA - NIGHT

               Brian climbs up onto Stephen's boat. Nobody home. He opens 
               the cabin door, goes inside and hits the lights.

               INT. STEPHEN'S BOAT - NIGHT

               There's cereal bowls in the sink, beer bottles on the table, 
               And a stack of fire department supplies in the corner.

               His whole body aching with reluctance, Brian begins looking 
               through them. Solvents, Armorall, a small specialty can of 
               fire dept. chemicals. There's a label of ingredients on it. 
               Way down at the bottom, Is trychticholorate. Nausea wracks 
               its way through Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh goddamn it Stephen...

               Footsteps. Brian spins around in stone shock as Stephen comes 
               into the cabin.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Hey, what are you doing here?

                                     BRIAN
                         Just... Just wanted to say hello...

                                     STEPHEN
                         So hello.

               Brian backs away from the chemicals.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Well, long as you're here you can 
                         help clean up a little. I've got a 
                         guy coming to look at this in a few 
                         minutes.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're selling dad's boat?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah, it's just another memory in my 
                         life right now. And I got way too 
                         many of them...

                                     BRIAN
                         I really should get back. There's... 
                         there's something I'm supposed to 
                         do.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Yeah? What have you got to do?
                              (beat)
                         Look at you. Look at your face. All 
                         the things you must be thinking. 
                         Man, you must really hate my guts. 
                         Well, you know what? It's okay.

                                     BRIAN
                         Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk 
                         about this some other --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- Okay, so you don't like me. You 
                         don't like everything I've done. 
                         What, because I wasn't such a genius 
                         the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, 
                         dad was gone, what was I supposed to 
                         do? You tell me, what the fuck was I 
                         supposed to do?!

               He KICKS the bulkhead wall.

                                     BRIAN
                         It's okay, Stephen, I --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I 
                         don't have all the answers, but 
                         goddamn it, I've got some.
                              (beat)
                         Look, you're gonna do what you have 
                         to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten 
                         in the way. I'm your brother, not 
                         your father. Go on. You gotta go 
                         somewhere? Go...

               Brian turns to leave. Pauses.

                                     BRIAN
                         I saw it.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Saw what?

                                     BRIAN
                         When dad died, I saw another fire...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Everybody did.

                                     BRIAN
                         I saw it before it got them. I tried 
                         to yell, but... He asked me to look 
                         out for him. And I didn't do it. I 
                         let him die.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (stunned)
                         ...Jesus, you been carrying that 
                         around for twenty years? For christ's 
                         sake, you were seven years old! You 
                         think he could have heard you in 
                         there?

                                     BRIAN
                         I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. 
                         You don't know how hard it was for 
                         me to put that uniform on...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Maybe I do.
                              (sighs)
                         ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?
                              (beat)
                         People can change Brian.

                                     BRIAN
                         Sometimes right when you're looking 
                         at them.

               Brian sees the chemicals in the corner again and something 
               freezes up inside. Stephen catches the look and there's 
               horrible silence between them.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh God, Stephen, what's going on 
                         with you?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I don't know, Brian... I don't know...

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - NIGHT

               Brian stands before the fire station. His brother's and his.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - UPSTAIRS LOCKER ROOM

               Brian PRIES the lock off Stephen's locker. Starts looking 
               through it. Adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on, 
               starts shaving in a mirror. He doesn't notice Brian. Adcox 
               turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little. 
               And Brian's universe caves in.

               An icy claw tears out his stomach. Gulping breaths, he forces 
               himself to look at Adcox's back.

               On it is a small, rectangular burn. It's fresh and it's the 
               size of a wall socket. At that moment Adcox turns. The two 
               of them stare at one another just a beat, then Adcox walks 
               past him. Just then the alarm bells RING. Brian hesitates a 
               beat, confused, then turns and runs down to

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR

               Where firemen are scurrying around, suiting up. Brian looks 
               frantically for Stephen, sees him out back.

               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - BACK OF STATION - SUNDOWN

                                     BRIAN
                              (breathless)
                         -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta 
                         talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- What are you doing here?

                                     BRIAN
                         I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! 
                         I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, 
                         he's been killing people!

                                     STEPHEN
                         I know.

                                     BRIAN
                         How do you know?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I knew when you came looking for the 
                         chemicals. Looking for me.

                                     BRIAN
                         -- What were they doing there?

                                     STEPHEN
                         They were for the fucking boat, Brian.

               Grindles sticks his head out the back door.

                                     GRINDLE
                         We gotta roll, Stevie...

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll be there.

                                     GRINDLE
                         They're waitin' man.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll be there, goddamn it!

               Grindle goes back in.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (to Brian)
                         Anything else?

                                     BRIAN
                         What are we going to do about this?

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'll handle it.

                                     BRIAN
                         We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.

                                     STEPHEN
                         I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. 
                         I'll handle it. Me.

               Stephen turns and walks toward the station.

               Brian's eyes go to a window just above it. There, watching 
               him, watching the whole exchange between brothers, is Adcox.

               Adcox stares at Brian a beat, then finally disappears as 
               Brian hears the cough of diesel engines.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh, Christ. Stephen...

               He starts running for the station.

               INT./EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - NIGHT

               -- It's too late. Adcox climbs aboard just as the engine 
               company pulls out and whistles down the street.

               The ladder company is just easing onto the drive. Brian 
               hesitates only an instant, then runs to the equipment racks, 
               PULLS off the hooks his helmet, coat, boots -- and jumps 
               onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit.

               INT./EXT. ENGINE COMPANY 17 - NIGHT

               As it howls down the avenue, Stephen turns around and stares 
               at Adcox sitting behind. The glimmer of an understanding...

               INT./EXT. TRUCK COMPANY 46 - NIGHT

               The laddermen look confused seeing Brian sitting among them.

               A CAR Suddenly CUTS the truck company off. The driver SLAMS 
               the brakes, PUSHING the truck company into a HORRIBLE SKID. 
               The back fishtails, the wheels JUMP the curb, BASH a mailbox, 
               and then the whole rig ROLLS onto its side and DRAGS to a 
               stop.

               It's tangled confusion in the rear cab. Firemen, unhurt, 
               piled atop one another. Brian slides his way out from under 
               them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise 
               six blocks away.

               He starts running.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE FIRE - NIGHT

               Flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along 
               the river as Brian, panting, runs up. He searches frantically 
               through the maze of arriving engine companies, looking for 
               number 17. There it is but nobody's home. Brian stops a 
               passing captain.

                                     BRIAN
                         Where are they? Where's 17?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         On the roof.

               Brian looks up at the smoke and whirling firestorm four 
               stories above him, feels the bile of fear in his throat, the 
               desperation, -- And begins strapping on an air tank.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an 
               extended aerial ladder.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

               Tongues of flame ROCKET skyward through ragged holes. Black 
               clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as 
               the roof itself GROANS like a comatose dinosaur, reminding 
               you the whole thing could go any minute -- and you with it.

               Trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, Brian looks 
               for his company. It's almost impossible to tell anyone apart, 
               faces hidden behind helmets and masks.

               Suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen 
               near the edge, "17" on their helmets.

                                     BRIAN
                         Stephen --

               The helmets look up. Stephen and Adcox. Facing each other. 
               Adcox cradles an axe.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Brian?

               Brian starts to move beside Stephen but Adcox turns, tightens 
               his grip on the axe, and now all the cards are on the table. 
               A hissing black cloud drifts through. They're the only three 
               people on earth.

               Adcox's eyes are clouded with tears.

                                     AXE
                         Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- What the fuck were you thinking, 
                         huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.

                                     AXE
                         They were killing firemen, man. When 
                         Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's 
                         files... They were my friends, I had 
                         to do it. I had to do it for the 
                         department.

                                     BRIAN
                         Did you do it for Tim?

                                     AXE
                              (pain, to Stephen)
                         That was an accident! Jesus Christ, 
                         why did you have to go in there so 
                         fucking early? Why didn't you listen 
                         to me!

               Brian and Stephen are backed up against the roof edge -- 
               sixty feet up. Far below a fireboat has begun pumping a 
               massive stream at the side of the building.

                                     AXE
                         You gotta let me finish --

                                     BRIAN
                         Just come down, John. Just --

                                     AXE
                         -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking 
                         puke if he saw how you've shit on 
                         his department!

                                     STEPHEN
                         -- Knock it off!

                                     AXE
                              (to Stephen)
                         -- You can't let him turn you against 
                         your friends, man --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- He killed people --

                                     AXE
                         -- You know what Swayzak would do to 
                         the department if this got out? --

                                     BRIAN
                         -- Stephen, this is bullshit --

                                     AXE
                         -- What he would do to your dad's 
                         department? You gotta let me finish 
                         it --

               And there's a horrible glimmer of confusion on Stephen's 
               face.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're his Lt., Stephen...
                              (beat)
                         Are you gonna handle it? Are you 
                         Stephen?

                                     STEPHEN
                         Shut up!

                                     AXE
                         ...What do you want me to do, Stephen? 
                         Talk to me. What am I supposed to 
                         do?

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat)
                         There's a fire. We've got a job here. 
                         Let's get on with it.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - ACROSS THE ROOF - NIGHT

               The rest of the crews are totally oblivious to what's 
               happening through the smoke on the other side. Grindle and 
               Santos feel the roof go suddenly spongy beneath them.

                                     GRINDLE
                         Shit... It's going! Clear the roof! 
                         Now!

               Everybody drops their equipment and runs for the edges as

               EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - BRIAN ET. AL - NIGHT

               Brian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof HOWLS and GROANS 
               and huge SPLITS begin racing along it. And then it goes.

               The center section DROPS, and in rolling waves of SCREECHING 
               steel, the hole spreads outward; DEVOURING.

               Adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole 
               races for them, SWALLOWING roof.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn 
                         it!

               And Brian balls-out dashes for the edge. Stephen's made one 
               corner, Brian desperately heads for another. At the last 
               instant -- as the HOWLING FLAME BELLOWS UP to his ankles -- 
               Brian LEAPS OFF the roof --

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               -- And falls half a story before CRASHING onto an exterior 
               fire escape. Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors 
               below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto 
               a ledge, KICKS out a window, steps through,

               And falls.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

               Blackness and emptiness, two stories of it, before he CRASHES 
               into a pool of water at the bottom. He's in a freight elevator 
               shaft, thrashing madly, drowning. Great SHEETS of WATER are 
               POURING through an upper doorway and CASCADING down like 
               monsoon rain.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIREBOAT

               We see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT

               The weight of his equipment is pulling Brian underwater. 
               Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water 
               still POURING DOWN, Brian unhooks his air tank. He leans 
               back, tries to float on the rising column of water. -- His 
               coat catches on something -- YANKS him underwater. He 
               struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off.

               The building GROANS in earnest. Flaming chunks of plaster 
               CRASH down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater. The 
               place is coming apart.

               Ten feet above, one of the falling chunks SMACKS a gas main, 
               SPLITTING then IGNITING it. A white-hot JET OF FLAME SHOOTS 
               from one side of the shaft to the other.

               Brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames.

               Brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but 
               his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat 
               becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under 
               water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to 
               drown or burn --

               -- When there's a CRASH. And suddenly another door on the 
               shaft is tearing open. There's a glint of an axe. A 
               flashlight.

               It's Stephen.

               Brian has about two seconds left. In that time Stephen sees 
               the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite. 
               It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal 
               curtain of flame. Before we can even assimilate that, 
               Stephen's already jumped. A crazy leap over the fire. He 
               SMACKS the opposite wall, HITS the shut-off, and FALLS 
               CRASHING into the pool beside Brian.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't 
                         you stay behind a desk where you 
                         belong?

                                     BRIAN
                         "You never know till the fire stares 
                         you down if you're gonna be --"

                                     STEPHEN
                         Oh shut up, huh?
                              (grimaces)
                         I think I broke my goddamn arm...

               Brian helps him stay above water. The level continues to 
               rise, bringing them finally even with an open doorway they 
               scramble through.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               It leads to a stairwell that's become a RAGING TORRENT of 
               water spilling down it. No way. They push through to the 
               next doorway and out onto

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The place is full of hundreds of chemical drums. The fire 
               has cracked its way into the room as WUMP -- drums begin 
               EXPLODING, SHOOTING UPWARD Roman candle fountains of 
               glittering FLAME. Brian helps Stephen as they snake their 
               way past sweating drums -- pressure valves hissing madly 
               with desperation. They duck low, round a corner,

               INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT

               -- And walk right into an axe handle that SMACKS Brian's 
               throat KNOCKING him gasping flat on his back. It's Adcox.

               Stephen JUMPS Adcox and TACKLES him on the edge of a metal 
               platform that extends out from the raised flooring.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You stupid son of a bitch! What the 
                         fuck are you doing!

                                     AXE
                         Stevie... I...

               Adcox struggles against him, heaving and sobbing.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Let it go! Goddamn it let it go!

               And Adcox releases the axe.

                                     AXE
                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

               Brian's on his feet now, coming toward them, when a chemical 
               drum below EXPLODES, the shock wave BUCKLING the platform 
               and DROPPING it several feet before it HOLDS. Brian, cut-
               off, is HIT with a wall of debris.

               Adcox and Stephen are FLUNG across the platform and THROUGH 
               the shattered railing. Stephen grabs a piece of broken, 
               dangling strut and hangs on with one hand.

               In his other hand is Adcox. Hanging below him, his grip 
               loosening.

                                     BRIAN
                         Stephen!

               Brian's struggling to get out from under the debris. The 
               railing Stephen's hanging onto is slick, his hand SLIPPING 
               along it. But he won't let go of Adcox. His eyes bore into 
               his best friend's with absolute conviction.

                                     STEPHEN
                         You go, we go.

               The towering shots of FLAME from below have begun to IGNITE 
               Adcox's pant leg. He's starting to burn. But Stephen won't 
               let go. Won't let go even as the flames crawl up Adcox's 
               back. And Stephen's hand is slipping and slipping and then 
               it isn't slipping anymore because it's come off.

                                     BRIAN
                         NO!

               Adcox and Stephen FALL. There's a narrow catwalk half-way 
               down. Stephen HITS with a sickening CRUNCH.

               Adcox falls past it, down into the flames.

               There's an exposed I-beam running from the ruined platform 
               out over the catwalk. Brian climbs up onto it, balances across 
               over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his 
               brother lies, battered but still alive.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're gonna be all right, man.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - FLOOR - NIGHT

               Brian looks down and across the factory floor. There, coming 
               through the doorway, is Pengelly and Nightengale with a 
               hoseline.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BRIAN
                         Hey! Over here!

               They start for him when another drum EXPLODES, FLATTENING 
               them and launching their hoseline into a crazy, thrashing 
               arc. The flame has cut them off from the hose. Stephen sees 
               what Brian's thinking.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Wait for another hose team...

               But Brian's already moving for the catwalk ladder.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Wait for the goddamn hose team!

               Brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and 
               SLIDES down to the factory floor. He's heading for the 
               hoseline when WHAM! -- The fire cuts him off. Not just any 
               fire. That same one from so many years ago.

               Don't fuck with me, kid. I'm not in the mood.

               Nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames 
               spinning slowly upside down -- just like his father's. Brian 
               stands there, paralyzed, as the fire laughs at him. Same old 
               little kid with his finger up his ass. Then something 
               different comes into Brian's eyes.

                                     BRIAN
                         No... No more.

               There's a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the 
               pole. Brian lifts it, approaches the fire. You can practically 
               hear the flames laugh at him. Brian suddenly turns and SLAMS 
               the neck of the extinguisher against the pole, BREAKING it 
               off before HEAVING the cannister HISSING into the flames 
               where it EXPLODES -- a cloud of extinguisher powder that 
               STUNS the flames just long enough for Brian to dash through 
               and TACKLE the hose.

               The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as 
               Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM.

               -- And it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple 
               with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening, 
               and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to Stephen 
               because the fire doesn't care -- it only has eyes for Brian 
               now --

               -- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster, and his eyes 
               fill with tears --

               -- And the fire's pushing Brian -- pushing him with the fury 
               of a frightened street bully -- but Brian won't give -- and 
               now the fire's back's broken -- it's whimpering, dying.

               And Pengelly and Nightengale have climbed up to Stephen now, 
               pulling him away.

                                     STEPHEN
                         That's my brother! That's my brother 
                         goddamn it!

               And the fire's just a little gremlin now, sighing sadly as 
               Brian steps up with the hoseline.

                                     BRIAN
                         Another time, friend.

               And whoosh, it's gone.

               EXT. BURNED BUILDING - NIGHT

               Brian rushes up as paramedics load his brother into an 
               ambulance.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (smiles, weak)
                         You are such a pain in the ass...

               As Brian jumps in with him

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

               Paramedics swarm over Stephen as the ambulance screams through 
               the night. Brian's right there, holding his hand.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't 
                         let 'em...

                                     BRIAN
                         I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... 
                         I won't.

               His brother squeezes Brian's hand, his eyes never leaving 
               him.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                              (reading EKG)
                         Oh shit, give him some lidocaine, 
                         now. Now.

                                     STEPHEN
                              (beat)
                         Who's your brother?

               Stephen's EKG's begun to falter. The other paramedic fires 
               off an injection into his IV.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                         His pressure's fading -- push some 
                         adrenalin.

               The EKG's become erratic. Stephen's eyes never leave Brian's.

                                     BRIAN
                         Oh man, don't you die... Don't you 
                         die...

                                     PARAMEDIC #2
                         He's going south... He's gonna box 
                         damn it...

               They put an ambo bag over Stephen's face. The eyes never 
               leave Brian's.

                                     BRIAN
                         Goddamn it don't you die now... Not 
                         now!

               They're breathing for him now. The EKG begins shrieking.

                                     PARAMEDIC
                         V-fib!

               The paramedics begin scrambling to load the defibrillator 
               pads on Stephen's chest. But the fireman's eyes never waver 
               from Brian. They look into his with complete conviction, 
               complete acceptance, And then they don't.

               FADE TO BLACK:

               Then, FADE UP TO:

               EXT. MICHIGAN AVE - DAWN

               A silent, quiet street absolutely empty of traffic. Then 
               over the crest of Chicago's mightiest thoroughfare, creeps 
               slowly a fire engine. It's emergency lights are on but not 
               the siren. This engine isn't in a hurry today.

               Behind comes another fire engine. And another. Ten, twenty, 
               all of them creeping slowly along. And behind the engines 
               now walk firemen in their dress blues. Hundreds of them. 
               Walking silently in step behind

               TWO COFFINS

               Loaded in the rear of Engine 17. Santos drives as Grindle, 
               Brian, and the men of ladder company 46, walk behind. The 
               silent procession passes under extended aerial ladders crossed 
               like dress swords. Average people stop, take their hats off.

               EXT. LAKE SHORE DRIVE - THE SILENT PROCESSION

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               Two coffins, lying side by side, draped in the blue and white 
               of the Chicago flag. A single fire helmet rests atop each 
               casket.

               Brian stands at attention beside Helen. He holds the hand of 
               Stephen's son Sean, his eyes clouded with tears as a fire 
               dept. honor guard plays Taps. Jennifer's there, too far away 
               to touch.

               Rimgale, still wearing a head bandage, stands stiffly beside 
               a brass bell and speaks with a voice raw and weary.

                                     SHADOW
                         In the Chicago Fire Department the 
                         alarm code 3-3-5 signifies that the 
                         company has returned home to quarters. 
                         We will now ring out that code to 
                         welcome home John Adcox and Stephen 
                         McCaffrey...

               With a small hammer Rimgale rings out 3-3-5 on the bell.

               The honor guard folds the flag covering Stephen's casket and 
               hands it to Helen, who holds it to her breast as we

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               A sea of blue uniforms drifting across green as the funeral 
               breaks up. Brian hugs Helen and Sean. Lets them go.

               EXT. CEMETERY EDGE - DAY

               Rimgale's there, resting against his dept. sedan as Brian 
               walks by, pauses, and leans on it beside him. A beat.

                                     SHADOW
                         Your brother was a good man.

                                     BRIAN
                         Yeah.

                                     SHADOW
                         Another couple of good men get burned 
                         up for their city? Is that how it's 
                         going to read?
                              (Brian doesn't answer)
                         You're the only one that knows.

                                     BRIAN
                         Like it never happened...

               Rimgale turns to walk back to his sedan. He pauses. Looks 
               back to Brian.

                                     SHADOW
                         Want to help me with something?

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               An elevator opens as Brian and Rimgale walk quickly out, 
               down a hall, and BURST into Swayzak's office.

               INT. SWAYZAK'S OFFICE - DAY

               The Alderman's there, giving a press conference from his 
               desk.

                                     SHADOW
                         Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?

                                     SWAYZAK
                              (confused)
                         Investigator...

               Rimgale sits on Swayzak's desk.

                                     SWAYZAK
                         I'm a little busy right now --

                                     SHADOW
                         This'll only take a minute. There's 
                         two cops outside that want to ask 
                         you about this --

               Rimgale drops the manning report on Swayzak's desk.

                                     SHADOW
                         This is just a guess of course, but 
                         I think they're gonna want to know 
                         why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove, 
                         Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to 
                         create a phony manpower study.
                              (to cameras)
                         You guys'll wait, right?

               The room explodes with questions. Through the din Brian leans 
               over the desk very close to Swayzak.

                                     BRIAN
                         See that glow flashing in the corner 
                         of your eye? That's your career 
                         dissipation light. And it just went 
                         into high gear.

               Brian turns and pushes his way out. At the door he pauses 
               and looks back at Rimgale. The investigator nods and smiles 
               just a little...

               INT. SWAYZAK'S OFFICE CORRIDOR

               As Brian walks down it, Rimgale appears and calls to him.

                                     SHADOW
                         -- Brian.

               Brian hesitates.

                         Don't keep looking over your shoulder 
                         for the ghost. It's gone now.

               And there's just a beat between the investigator and his 
               probie before Brian nods and walks away.

               EXT. SWAYZAK OFFICE CORRIDOR

               Brian walks down the hall. He passes Jennifer's small office. 
               She's in there, surrounded by packing boxes.

                                     BRIAN

               And morning breaking across the avenues and up against the 
               tired brick of firehouse 17.

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - LOCKER ROOM

               Brian sits staring into his locker, lost in thought, his 
               equipment stacked up on the bench beside him. THE ALARM KLAXON 
               SOUNDS

               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR

               And firemen scurrying to their equipment on the apparatus 
               floor. They're climbing aboard their rigs now and the pumper's 
               diesel is coughing to life.

               At the last moment, as it begins to pull out, Brian comes 
               sliding down the pole in his turn-out gear, bounces off the 
               floor, and climbs aboard as the engine WHISTLES away.

               INT. ENGINE 17 - CAB

               There's a new fireman beside him on the bench. He can't get 
               his coat buckled right. Brian leans over does it for him.

                                     BRIAN
                         You're doing it wrong.

               EXT. FIRE ENGINE 17 - STREET - DAY

    FADE IN:

1   EXT. MIAMI LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   1
    The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of
    heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates
    ACROSS the SCREEN.

2   INT. UNMARKED VAN - IN MOTION - NIGHT                          2
    The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen-
    ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He
    looks to the rear.
                             FOUCHET
               What's taking so long back there?
                                                  CUT TO:

    REAR
    Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON,
    and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except
    for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform.
    His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be-
    along grin on his face.
                             ANDY
               How do I look? Like the real
               thing, yeah?
                             FOUCHET
               Step back and lemme get a good
               look at you.


    CLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR
    THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps
    further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the
    front.
                             FOUCHET
               Tell me again about your
               assignment, Andrew?
                             ANDY
               I'm the decoy.
                             FOUCHET
               Right you are.
    Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM!

                                                              2.
3    EXT. VAN IN MOTION                                            3
     Andy's body is blown through the rear doors as the van
     turns a corner.

4    INT. VAN - FOUCHET                                            4
     He dials 911 on his cellular phone.     Fouchet sounds
     distressed.
                            FOUCHET
              Please help! I just saw a
              policeman shot! Send help.
              Hurry! I'm at the corner of...


5    EXT. NEAR DOWNTOWN - VAN - NIGHT                              5
     A stream of PD CARS haul past, lights blazing and SIRENS
     on full.

6    EXT. COLONY HOTEL (SOUTH BEACH) - NIGHT                       6
     Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people
     walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from
     nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the
     hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with:
                            POLICE RADIO (V.O.)
              Report of an officer down. Be
              advised, all units. Corner of
              Lennox and Taylor.
     Slipping by the street cop: Intro MARCUS BURNETT and
     MIKE LOWREY. They shimmy through the hotel doors.


A7   INT. COLONY HOTEL - NIGHT                                     A7
     Where the buffed DESK MANAGER gets off the phone to
     greet the effeminate pair.
                              LOWREY
              Good evening.    I'm Mike --
                            BURNETT
              -- And I'm Marcus.
                            LOWREY
              We're lookin' for a couple of our
              Latin friends who checked in a
              little while ago. You might
              remember them?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.
A7   CONTINUED:                                                  A7
                            BURNETT
              No chest hair. And packin'.
                             DESK MANAGER
              I'm sorry.   But our guest list is
              private.
                            LOWREY
              Oh, didn't they say? There's
              going to be party! It's
              B.Y.O.B.O. --
                     (leans in close)
              The B.O. stands for baby oil.
                            BURNETT
              Maybe you can come. Get off after
              you get off?
     All three of them laugh.
                            DESK MANAGER
              Well, now that you mention it.
              They were kinda cute. Suite 202.

7    INT. COLONY HOTEL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                       7
     Lowrey and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster
     their guns. The posing is over. This is business.

A8   INT. COLONY HOTEL - SUITE 202 - NIGHT                       A8
     On the table are two briefcases. Each opened. One
     containing cocaine. The other, cash. A pistol next
     to each.

     REVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across
     from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out
     loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx.
     Then --
     BANG! The door's kicked in and Lowrey's first through.
     Burnett on backup.
                             LOWREY
              Police!   On the floor!
     But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs.   One
     goes left and the other, right.
                                               CUT TO:

                                                           4.
B8   BEDROOM                                                      B8
     Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA
     girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a
     hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered,
     Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw
     and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs
     him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:

8    LIVING ROOM                                                  8
     Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand.
     But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs
     of a chair.
                              BURNETT
                Lowrey!
     Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles.
     Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just
     in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for
     him.

A9   EXT. COLONY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION                        A9
     Burnett   and the other dealer come crashing out onto the
     balcony,   then over onto an awning, rolling off onto some
     occupied   cafe tables. Patrons scatter. Uniformed cops
     move in   to assist.

9    LOWREY                                                       9
     appears soon after, walking down the hotel steps, leading
     the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket.

                              BURNETT
                       (scraped, bruised,
                        pissed)
                Nice backup.
                              LOWREY
                What?
     We TILT UP as POLICE HELICOPTER flies overhead.

10   EXT. MIAMI BEACH SKYLINE - TITLE SEQUENCE - NIGHT            10
     As OPENING TITLES RUN and MUSIC POUNDS -- we FLY OVER the
     causeways, waterways and hotels that line the beach.
     Something is happening in the balmy city as we CRUISE
     downtown and ZERO IN ON...

                                                          5.
11   EXT. MIAMI'S OLDEST POLICE STATION (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT       11
     The HELICOPTER ROARS low over the rooftops toward the
     causeway bridge.

12   EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - FOUCHET - NIGHT             12
     As the helicopter passes over, he appears  from behind a
     large exhaust port. Casper, Ferguson, and   Noah behind
     him, all wearing high-tech miner's helmets  with built-in
     radio headsets, and an array of high-tech  tools.
                              FOUCHET
              It's time.
     The team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning
     unit. They climb inside, carrying a six-foot-long metal
     case and what looks like a black scuba tank.

13   INT. AIR UNIT/SHAFTS                                        13
     Though it's windy and cramped in here, at least it's
     cool. From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night
     vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly
     he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded
     onto the unit. TILT DOWN to see the various ducts.
     Endless. Bottomless. But clearly, Fouchet's a man who
     knows his way.

14   INT. POLICE STATION - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT               14
     Seemingly empty.   From squad rooms to locker rooms to
     booking.


15   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - GUARD STATION                          15
     OFFICER BILL O'FEE, 50s, reads a magazine and drinks
     coffee. Video monitors in front of him show the
     different lockers inside the evidence room. We see one
     room with stacks upon stacks of heroin.

16   IN AIR UNIT                                                 16
     The team, attached to cables, slide into the building's
     guts and disappear. STATIC CRACKLES:
                               FOUCHET
              We're in.     Start the video.

                                                              6.
17   EXT. POLICE STATION - ALLEY - NIGHT                           17
     Kuni finds the conduit he's looking for, splices it,
     cuts into it with a Makita battery-powered circular saw,
     then attaches a handheld high-8 video machine and starts
     the video feed. The unit is strapped to the conduit.

18   INT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT                                    18
     The MONITORS FLUTTER, then STABILIZE.    Turning the page,
     O'Fee sugars his coffee.

19   INT. TRASH CHUTE ROOM - NIGHT                                 19
     An air vent smashes to the floor.    Two guys pull the
     metal case inside the room.

20   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - HEROIN LOCKER - NIGHT                    20
     BANG! Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to
     the floor. Their headlights blazing, two men clamber
     into the cavernous room, Fouchet along with Casper. This
     is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts like
     butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred
     million dollars in heroin. Each kilo brick is stamped
     with a distinctive octopus logo.
                            FOUCHET
                     (into mic)
              Where's Deputy Dog?
                            FERGUSON (V.O.)
                     (over radio mic)
              He made us.

                            FOUCHET
              Then do him, now!

21   GUARD STATION                                                 21
     Sure enough.    As O'Fee stands from his desk --
                                                  CUT TO:

22   VENT ABOVE                                                    22
     Where Ferguson is waiting with an air-powered tranquil-
     izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that strikes
     O'Fee at the base of the neck. O'Fee stops. But before
     he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees
     buckle and he drops to the linoleum. Out cold.

                                                            7.
23   INT. POLICE STATION - QUICK SHOTS - FERGUSON - NIGHT        23
     One by one he moves backwards through the various levels
     of locks, torching each to look as if they'd entered the
     evidence room from inside the PD station.
     Meanwhile --

24   TRACH CHUTE ROOM                                            24
     Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with
     large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it
     inside the air shaft.
     Ferguson attaches the black "scuba tank," labeled
     "NITROUS OXIDE," to a valve. This is connected to a
     metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the
     floor.
                                               CUT BACK TO:

25   HEROIN LOCKER                                               25
     Fouchet and Casper moving the stacks of heroin, placing
     them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once they're done,
     we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con-
     traption. A button is pushed -- and the sled is pulled
     at breakneck speed through the duct.

26   EXT. POLICE STATION ALLEY - NIGHT                           26
     Bag after bag drops down the trash chute and tumbles into
     an open-roofed van where the last of the gang, Eddie
     Dominguez, waits with the ENGINE RUNNING.


27   IN AIR DUCT                                                 27
     The sled rockets by again -- WHOOSH -- loaded with more
     bags.

28   INT. HEROIN LOCKER                                          28
     Casper and Fouchet throw the last of their gear down the
     chute and ride the sled out.

29   EXT./INT. VAN - POLICE STATION - ALLEY                      29
     One! Two! Three! Four! They all land atop the bags.
     Eddie GUNS the VAN, which rolls up the ramp and out the
     garage.

     On the ledge the tape runs out and RECORDER EXPLODES.
     Pieces scatter.

31   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                         31
     The van drives off into the golden sunrise of Miami.
     TITLES END.


32   EXT. LUXURY HIGH-RISE (COCONUT GROVE) - MORNING             32
     One of those expensive condo buildings on Brickell Avenue
     with a circular driveway and a uniformed doorman.

33   INT. CONDO - MORNING                                        33
     CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH expensive and trendy bachelor's
     lair. State-of-the-art everything, gorgeous artwork.
     Spectacular view.
     CAMERA STALLS ON -- a perma-plaqued newspaper clipping
     with a photo depiction of Lowrey and Burnett in front of
     a giant pile of black heroin, thumbs up to the camera.
     The headline reads: MIAMI PD RECORDS RECORD HEROIN BUST.

34   INT. LOWREY'S BEDROOM - MORNING                             34

     Where Lowrey wakes up in a king-sized bed. The pain on
     his face and empty, scattered bottles tell us he's
     nursing a world-class hangover. He sits up, carefully,
     holds his aching head. Hearing BREATHING, Lowrey lifts
     the sheet next to him.

     REVEAL THE LATINA
     The one from the Colony Hotel. He drops the sheet back
     over her head, reaches over to his nightstand and grabs
     an industrial-sized bottle of Excedrin. Empty. He opens
     the nightstand drawer, extracts another bottle. Empty.

     All marble and brass. Lowrey opens up his medicine
     cabinet. Locating a new bottle of aspirin... he suddenly
     realizes that the SHOWER is RUNNING. Confused, he pulls
     open the shower curtain slightly. From the back, it's an
     incredible body, then she turns around and it's --
     THE LATINA
     Yes.   The very same as the one he just saw in bed.    What?
                               LATINA TWIN
               'Morning.
     Lowrey closes the curtain on her. Frowns at this
     impossibility. He steps back into the doorway and peers
     over at his bed. Yep, same face. Twins?
                             LOWREY
                      (shaking his head)
               Oh man...
     He tears open the bottle of aspirin.    Chug-a-lugs.

36   INT. BURNETT HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING                      36
     Burnett and his young wife, THERESA, are jarred awake by
     the CLOCK RADIO BLARING on the night stand. Theresa
     gropes for RADIO, shuts it OFF. Burnett playfully gropes
     for her.
                             THERESA
               Marcus, what are you doing?
                             BURNETT
               We're always saying we should
               spend more quality time together.
               Well, I got the time... and you
               got the quality...
     She laughs.   He kisses her.
                             BURNETT
               I can remember when we used to
               do it every morning.
                             THERESA
               That was how we got a three
               bedroom house filled with little
               Burnetts.
     She crawls from bed.
                             BURNETT
               Been over a week since I've had
               some quality time!

37   INT. BURNETT'S KITCHEN - MORNING                          37
     Pandemonium. There's the two-and-a-half-year-old,
     MEGAN, who's taking bites of food and spitting it back
     out, looking at it, then putting it back in. Six-year-
     old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the
     fridge. And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side-
     stepping his eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on
     roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and
     ball. He body-checks Jill against the ice box.
                            JILL
              Mom, Quincy pushed me.
                            QUINCY
              Uncle Mike showed me that move.

                            THERESA
              Quincy, never-you-mind. And take
              those things off in the house!
              Jill, stop with the book and eat
              your breakfast.
                     (then, exasperated)
              Marcus, why do I always have to
              discipline the kids? You play
              bad cop for a second.
     Alongside the kitchen screen door we see Lowrey's PORSCHE
     ROAR to a stop in the driveway.
                            BURNETT
              Kids, knock it off... or your
              momma's gonna whoop your butts!
     Theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue
     to fight. Into this craziness enters Mike Lowrey...
                            LOWREY
              Ah, family life. Reminds me
              why I stay single.
                             JILL & QUINCY
              Uncle Mike!   Uncle Mike!
                             LOWREY
              Hiya, kids.   Mornin', Theresa.
     Lowrey pecks Theresa on the cheek.   She recoils.
                            THERESA
              Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't
              know where those lips were last
              night.

              I don't want him knowing about it
              either! Gives him ideas.
                     (answers the phone)
              Hello? Oh, sure. Which one of
              them do you want?
     Lowrey accepts the phone from Theresa and talks.
                            LOWREY
              You're live with Lowrey.
                     (listens for a
                      long beat)
              'Scuse me, Captain. I think you
              mean to say, 'Get the fuck down
              here, please?'
     Burnett automatically pulls on his jacket, hugs the
     children as Lowrey hangs up.

                            THERESA
              Not so fast. You were going to
              take the kids to school today,
              remember, hon? I have a job

     Lowrey rolls his eyes.

     door when his neighbor, DICK, accosts him from across
     the hedge.

               Hey, Marcus. Did you know we got
               busted into again last night? When
               are you gonna do something about this?
                             BURNETT
               Hey, Dick. How many times I gotta
               tell you? I don't work robbery.
               I'm in Narcotics.
      Meanwhile, Lowrey's holding the car door open as the kids
      pile into the jump seat in the back.
                             LOWREY
               Don't get your sticky fingers all
               over my windows... and keep your
               feet off the seats, I just had the
               leather conditioned.
      The kids ignore him, gleefully continuing to squirm
      around. Before Burnett can get into the car, Theresa
      runs out.
                             THERESA
               Marcus... I need you to stop at
               Save-More on the way home and pick
               up exactly what's on the list.
      She hands Burnett a long list.
                              BURNETT
               Oh, baby.   Damn.
      Lowrey shakes his head.

     Burnett and Lowrey know there's big problems when, at the
     bottom of the stairwell, the first thing they see is a
     yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched
     lock. Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and
     it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over
     the evidence room.

     Both laugh hysterically, while:

              If it ain't the leftovers from
              Miami Vice. Fashion casualties,
              lost somewhere in the eighties.
                            BURNETT
              And the women really go for that.
              Really, they do.
     As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very
     groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a
     paramedic team. He's still out cold. An oh shit look
     passes between the two partners.

     Another torched lock noted as Burnett and Lowrey enter
     with Sanchez an Ruiz behind them. The room is emptied.
     Captain HOWARD appears. He's short, has a military
     haircut, and has a minor Napoleon complex and a major in
     paranoia.
                            HOWARD
              Nice of you to roll in. And
              nothing particular is going on
              around here except, maybe, your
              dope is gone. That's right. The
              biggest dope bust in the history
              of this department up and walked
              out of this locker, along with

              if we don't get the shit back.

              So here's what we're gonna do.
              Since it was originally your
              case, you two guys are on point.
              Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them
              up with whatever they need.
     Groans all around.
                            LOWREY
              So I guess we should start with
              the C.I.s and the perps from the
              original case. But hell if I
              know any dope dealers with the
              balls to pull this off. They're
              either dead or in the lock-up
              pending trial.
                               BURNETT
              How's O'Fee?
                            SINCLAIR (O.S.)
              Oh, he'll be just fine.
     From the side appears a cigar-chewing Internal Affairs
     suit named SINCLAIR. He circles close to Burnett and
     Lowrey, waving his cigar as he speaks.
                            HOWARD
              Name's Sinclair. Internal
              Affairs. He's our new proctologist.
                            SINCLAIR
              You see, what's got me confused
              is, why risk leaving a witness?
              Why not kill O'Fee instead?

                            BURNETT
              Because maybe this guy knows if
              you kill a cop the whole
              department'll get up his ass
              hard and fast.
                            SINCLAIR
              And who knows that better than
              anybody else? Cops.
                            BURNETT
              You're not sayin' this was an
              inside job. Cops wouldn't pull
              this shit.

              Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's
              nothing we can do about it. If
              any of this leaks, the shit's
              gonna hit our biggest fan.
              Remember him? The mayor? He
              created us and you can bet your
              jobs, boys, he'll rip us into
              little cop pieces. I figure we
              got seventy-two hours to find the
              dope and keep our jobs.

              Nothing like a little old-fashioned
              incentive.

     CLOSE ON BURNETT
     He walks to the center of the room and kneels to those
     four bolt holes in the floor. He fingers the paraffin
     filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate.

                            BURNETT
              What about the air conditioning?
                            HOWARD

              For one, it was your idea. Two,
              while my suit's fresh, you're
              dressed for the occasion.
                            BURNETT
              Don't say nothin' about my
              clothes. I paid for these.
                               LOWREY
              And I don't?
                            BURNETT
              Not on a cop's salary.

     Burnett crawls up with some help from Lowrey below,
     stalling the oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling
     through. The first thing Burnett notices are the track
     marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust.
                             LOWREY
              Anything?
                            BURNETT
              Yeah. I got some weird track
              marks in here.
     Then Burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint.
     It reads: ORONA AIR CONTITIONING SYSTEMS, INC.

              Nice and cool up there, Burnett?
              Comfy? Maybe there's a new career
              for you in building maintenance.

     Lowrey and Burnett with their desks opposite each other.
     The CAMERA CIRCLES while they lay the arm on some
     informants.
                            BURNETT
              There's gonna be a lotta cash
              when the dope hits the street.
              We want you to put the word out
              through your bank and hustle the
              account.  You help us, maybe we
              can see about getting those R.T.C.
              auditors off your ass.
                            LOWREY
              Listen, Cedras. You and I both
              know you're the number one importer
              for the Simona Brothers. And I'm
              tellin' you there's a buttload of
              H on the move and someone's gonna
              wanna stick their dick in it. So
              it better not be yours. You hear
              something? You call us. You hear
              nada? You better get the fuck
              outta town.

      Lowrey's driving, no seatbelt, doing his usual speed-
      weaving. Burnett's hanging onto the handle above the
      door.
                             BURNETT
               Not a fucking lead. So now that
               we've done the obvious, we need
               a shortcut.
                              LOWREY
               Okay.   So we talk to Max.
                             BURNETT
               Huh uh. Not this time. I'm
               tired of you working pussy into
               everything we do.
                             LOWREY
               You got a better idea?

A46   EXT. CONGRESS GYM - ESTABLISHING - DAY                       A46
      Lowrey and Burnett arrive in the unmarked car.

46    INT. CONGRESS GYM - DAY                                      46
      Once-colorful stucco, fading and crumbling. Scrappy
      Cuban fighters spar and work out on the aging equipment
      while, at the same time, a remarkable amount of amazing-
      looking women work out on weight bags, shadow box with
      trainers. Curves and sweat, any way you look.

      BURNETT AND LOWREY

      enter. And while Lowrey cruises amongst the sweaty flesh
      as if it were a day in the park, Burnett lags. Maybe he
      has been married too long.

      CLOSE ON MAX LOGAN
      she's doing sit-ups on an incline bench.     She notices
      Lowrey.
                              MAX
               Hi, Mike.   You come to work-out?
                             LOWREY
               Raincheck, darlin'. Gotta talk.
               Anyplace we can go?

     This room isn't enclosed. It's walled by wire mesh.
     Private enough, though. Max shuts the door.

                            LOWREY
              Sorry to come around only when
              I need something.
                            MAX
              Forget about it. I owe you the
              rest of my life, Mike.
     Lowrey just gives her an "oh please" look.
                            MAX
              Don't be lookin' at me like I'm
              getting all sentimental.
                            LOWREY
              Hey, I didn't open my mouth.
              Listen, there's some major, major
              ill shit happening down at the
              P.D. Lotta heroin involved. There's
              gonna be a lotta cash involved, too.
              Gonna be some happy motherfuckers
              around that wanna party.
                            MAX
              So you want me to check around?
                            LOWREY
              Just make a coupla calls. See what's
              what. Don't be doin' no wild shit.
              Just call me if you hear something.

48   INT. BOXING GYM - DAY                                       48
     Burnett is surrounded by beautiful, sweaty women. One of
     them is a fabulous BLACK WOMAN with legs so long and
     toned, they're not just legs, they're weapons. Burnett
     can't help but stare.

              A cop.
                              BLACK WOMAN
              Oooh.    I love cops.
     The other girls are suddenly interested, too.   Burnett
     swallows and...
                            BURNETT
              You know? I'm a cop. I shot
              somebody just last week. Didn't
              kill him, just shot him in the
              ass.
     Stone cold looks from them all. They walk away with
     Burnett giving a "what did I say" look. Lowrey appears.
                            LOWREY
              You know, that was really smooth.
              Think you could do that again?
                     (as they start
                      walking)
              Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife
              gets meaner, the grass gets greener.
                            BURNETT
              Green ain't the color I was
              thinkin' of. More of a coco puff.
              Just real shiny, thick...

     As they head toward their car, Burnett's BEEPER SOUNDS.
     He switches it OFF.
                            BURNETT
              Damn! The woman's got fuckin'
              radar on my ass. Sensed me
              lookin' at another woman. Bet
              she wants me to pick up Huggies
              'stead of those baby Garanimals
              that they wear.
                            LOWREY
              I don't think anybody could be
              that married.

50   INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR - IN MOTION - DAY                 50
     Burnett drives cautiously while both he and Lowrey bob
     to Ice-T's "COP KILLER." They get a kick out of the
     song.
                            LOWREY
                     (complies)
              Miami's the perfect town for you,
              Burnett. You drive like a one-
              hundred-seven-year-old lady with
              her turn signal on.
                            BURNETT
              And I plan on living to be old
              just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay
              on my joints and everythin'.

     An old guy passes them even though his car is pulling
     an Airstream camper behind it. Lowrey can't believe it.
                            LOWREY
              You gonna let every old
              motherfucker pass you? Or just
              the ones with big-ass trailers
              draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.
                            BURNETT
              I don't have a death wish like
              you. I  got a family that counts
              on me.  A mortgage to pay. And
              I'm not sayin' it's me, but most
              of the guys in the station think
              you're some rich kid playin' cop.
                            LOWREY
              Who said that?

     Burnett mumbles an answer.
                            LOWREY
              If somebody's talking about me, I
              wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of
              this. I don't apologize for
              nothing I do. I get up early and
              take it to the max every day. I'm
              always the first guy through the
              door. And the last guy to leave a
              crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I
              could give a shit what those boot
              lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin'
              motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey.
     What can Burnett say to all that, but...

              Two-one? I got that address for
              you on the air conditioning
              company. Oh, and Theresa called,
              she added something to your grocer
              list: Muppets toothpaste. Bubble
              gum flavor. She says Quincy
              doesn't like mint.
     Lowrey rolls his eyes, glances at Burnett, who's
     embarrassed.
                           LOWREY
              Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the

     Burnett and Lowrey step from their unmarked car and
     start up the steps to this stony, estate-sized house.

                            LOWREY
              The air conditioning business
              has been good to Orona.
     Lowrey rings the bell.   They wait.   No answer.

              Well, we can leave a note or we
              can break and enter --

              Uh oh.    No alarm.
                              BURNETT

     Lowrey and Burnett look at each other and draw guns.

53   INT. ORONA'S DEN - DAY                                        53
     The door is unlocked and swings open easily to reveal
     Lowrey and Burnett in an instant, repulsed reaction to
     Orona's body which sits upright in his office chair, the
     body grotesque and bloated.
                               LOWREY
              Now what?
     A sickened Burnett goes over to the body, speaking to
     Orona as if he were alive.
                            BURNETT
              Where are the drugs?
                     (no answer)
              Where... are... the... drugs?
                     (shrugs)
              He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must
              be guilty of somethin'.
     Meanwhile, Lowrey's got   no problem with the dead body.
     He tries opening a desk   drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis-
     stiffened knee is in the   way. So Lowrey gives it a shove
     and the chair swivels.    Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp
     off the desk.
                            BURNETT
              Whoa. Watch where you're swinging
              them dead arms, Orona. You're
              gonna fuck up your own crime
              scene.

     pockets.

                Watch what you touch.   That's

                Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona.
                You've got the right to remain

              I'll talk to her but she's not

      beautiful as Max and dressed to be undressed. She drops
      one of those big, model's shoulder bags to the floor and
      gazes curiously back at Lois and Max. Her ears are
      burning.

              It's a favor for a friend. If it

              A favor?
                            MAX
              You know, my friend Mike Lowrey.

                     (rolls her eyes)
              Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you
              just have sex with the man and get
              it over with.
                            MAX
              He's just a friend.
                               JULIE
              Yeah, right.     You're in love.
                            MAX
              It's never gonna happen. I'm
              great at turning lovers into
              friends. But turning friends
              into lovers, I can't do.
                            JULIE
              Well, I don't date cops. They
              never have enough money and
              they're always too tired to
              screw.
                            MAX
              Well, I've told you before, my
              Mike isn't like that. If I were
              in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is
              the only person I'd call.

     Upon arrival, the door is opened to Max and Julie by
     Eddie Dominguez, instantly recognizeable from the heist.
     Eddie's pouring champagne into a glass.
                             EDDIE
               Max, my little carina. It's
               been a long time. And who's
               your friend?
                              MAX
               Eddie.   Julie.

     Julie sizes him up.    Good taste.   His suit.   Bad taste.
     His personality.
                             EDDIE
               Come on, Julie. Come in, Max.
               Welcome to the Al Capone suite.
     Thev're stepped into a grand, opulent suite. High
     arched ceilings. Magnificent antique furniture. Killer
     view. No party guests.
                             EDDIE
               I'm not kidding. Capone had
               the place fixed up with secret
               passages and hidden stairways.
               Can you dig it? People were
               actually killed within these
               walls.
     He's moved behind them and reveals a concealed staircase
     that rises into darkness.


     CLOSE ON JULIE
     Not happy. Stuck at the Biltmore with a Scarface
     wannabe. She looks over at Max. Let's get outta here.
                              JULIE
               Excuse me?   I need to use the
               bathroom.
     Julie crosses to the bathroom.
                             EDDIE
               Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped
               off the edge of the earth and died.
               Either that or you moved to
               California.

              what Eddie's got to play with.
     From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of
     heroin. Max tries to hide the recognition that she just
     hit paydirt on the very first try.

     Where she's silently cursing Max for getting her into
     this lame-ass party when she hears MUFFLED VOICES outside
     the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through the
     louvered shades.

61   JULIE'S POV - THROUGH SHADES                               61
     She sees Eddie opening the door to Fouchet.   Casper and

              I could use a friend who looks
              like you. Turn around. Lemme
              get a good look.
     Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit. She
     does her best model's turn. Slowly giving him a view of
     the rear when --
     Fouchet draws a PISTOL -- BAM BAM!!
     Max tumbles forward and CRASHES through a GLASS TABLE.

     the opposite side of the bathroom in total fright.

               I don't need anybody. I got three
               little angels looking over my
               shoulder.

     REVERSE SHOT - EDDIE'S CHAIR
     Fouchet UNLOADS THREE MORE SHOTS.    BAM BAM BAM!!!   Blood
     spatters onto Casper.
                            CASPER
               Aw, man. You got blood on my
               new suit.

     Half-panicked, half-trying to keep her head. There's no
     way out of the bathroom. All she can do is switch off
     the light. And now she sees Casper's shadow as he
     approaches.

     CLOSE ON DOORKNOB
     As it turns. Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls
     open the door with a surge. Casper stumbles in, his
     face hitting the hard tile with a crunch.

66   INT. CAPONE SUITE - JULIE                                  66

     Making her move, she hauls as fast as she can across the
     room. Aiming for that secret fireplace door.

     FOUCHET
     Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are
     catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the
     suite. Julie dives right into the secret door.

67   INT. SECRET PASSAGEWAY - SAME TIME                         67
     Dark. Twisting. We MOVE WITH Julie as she races through
     it, heart in her throat. She comes upon some old metal
     stairs, a sliver of light at the top, and clambers up...

68   EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT                                    68
     High atop the Biltmore, this is where the passageway
     leads out to. A door flies open and Julie appears.
     Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies
     by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie
     sprints as best she can across the Spanish-tiled roof.
     Turns to see --

69   EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT                                    69
     Noah and Casper appear in the Bell Tower. Noah scans
     the roof, takes aim and FIRES, but he's too far away --
     and Julie disappears behind a rise in the roof.

70   EXT. BILTMORE - ROOFTOP - JULIE - NIGHT                    70
     She steps towards the edge of the roof. Quickly peers
     over. A huge swimming pool, five stories down.

     Then Julie prays silently, takes a running start and
     leaps from the roof. SLOW-MOTION as Julie flies through
     the air like some glamorous angel.

     been photographed and are covered. Chief Howard is
     conferring with a technician who's dusting for prints.

     BURNETT AND LOWREY

     But Sanchez and Ruiz are already on the scene.

               You guys watch where you're walking
               or you'll fuck up the crime scene.

               Looks like you're already doing
               that.
     Burnett's quick to point out the trail of bloody foot-
     prints Ruiz just tracked across the carpet.

     CLOSE ON CHAMPAGNE GLASS
     Which Julie left on the fireplace mantel. Lowrey's quick
     to note the two separate shades of lipstick.

               Two dead. A hood registered as
               Eddie Dominguez and some Jane
               Doe. But the table over there's
               covered in high-grade dope. Sound
               familiar?
                                LOWREY
               I think we    got us a witness.
               Over here    I got two different
               shades of    lipstick on one
               champagne    glass.

     Burnett drops the sheet, turns and puts a protective
     shoulder between Lowrey and the body.
                               LOWREY
              What?     Who is it?
     Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels
     at the body. He pulls back the sheet. Right now he
     could kill the shooter, then himself. In that order.
     Lowrey's eyes well up.
                            LOWREY
              I shoulda told you to be careful.

     The elevator doors open and out step Burnett and Lowrey
     into a lobby full of cops. Lowrey goes straight to the
     front desk.
                            LOWREY
              Eddie Dominguez. I want his
              phone calls.
     He flashes a badge.
                            HOTEL CLERK
              You pay the bill you can see
              his phone calls.
                               LOWREY
              I'm sorry.     Maybe I wasn't polite
              enough.
     With a flashing right jab, Lowrey pops the snooty Clerk.
     After the Clerk finds his feet, eyes peering over the
     counter...
                            BURNETT
              I wouldn't fuck with him right

               and tell her a bedtime story.
               You can catch a ride with Howard.
     Lowrey jumps in the car.

     Replete with balcony and billowy curtains, the old-styled
     madame LOIS FIELDS sits up on her bed covered in pillows
     and exotic stuffed animals. She thumbs an old, leather-
     bound looseleaf binder full of modeling photos and
     resumes.

     Lowrey eases inside the darkness of the doorway. He
     checks the lights, but the power is off. Slipping the
     radio into his coat pocket, he returns with a mini-
     flashlight and begins to clear a path, doorway by

     MOVING THROUGH the doors of the master suite where a light

     turns ever-so-slowly with his flashlight following a beat

     laying on the bed amongst huge pillows and exotic stuffed

     Julie's. Lowrey goes    for the phone. Picks it up with
     his handkerchief. No    dial tone. So he drops the
     receiver and heads out   of the room. But just as he
     reaches the doorway --
     Suddenly -- Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS.
     He jumps.    Reaches down to switch it off when --
     From out of those billowing curtains -- Noah!
     Sledgehammer in hand, he swings at Lowrey, who instinc-
     tively blocks and ducks as the hammer misses and crushes
     the bannister railing. It gives under Lowrey's weight,
     who reaches over and traps the sledgehammer, only to find
     one of Noah's hammy fists battering him behind the ear
     until --
     The rail finally gives way.
     Lowrey falls and crashes onto a Craftsman table covered
     in antique picture frames. It collapses underneath him.

     He notices his gold wedding band, hastily removes it.
     Just as he drops it into his jacket pocket --
                              JULIE (O.S.)
              Who's there?
                              BURNETT
              Mike Lowrey.
     INTERCUT WITH:

91   INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT                                         91
     She stands on the other side of the door with a baseball
     bat, cocked and ready to fly.
                            JULIE
              How do I know it's Detective
              Lowrey?
                            BURNETT
              ... 'Cuz I'm Mike Lowrey.      I'm a
              cop. Wanna see my badge?
                            JULIE
              Yes! I wanna see it now! I'm
              not letting you through the fucking
              door until I do. Hold it up to
              the peephole!
     Burnett shows his shield.    Holds it up to the peephole.
                            JULIE
              Anybody can get one of those.

                            BURNETT
                     (annoyed)
              Hey, lady. You called me,
              remember...? 'On the mike with
              Mike.'
     After a beat, the door swings ajar.

92   INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                     92
     But as Burnett enters the house, all he notices are that
     two DOGS start YAPPING HYSTERICALLY. He can't see her.
     But she can see him. From behind the door, she comes out
     swinging a bat. Burnett ducks and Julie smashes the hat
     stand instead.

              What the fuck was that for?
                            JULIE
              You're not Mike Lowrey!
                            BURNETT
              What do you mean I'm not Mike
              Lowrey? You never even met
              him! Me.
                            JULIE
              The way Max described you was
              different.

                            BURNETT
              I'm undercover.
     She doesn't believe him and swings the bat.
                              BURNETT
              Okay.    I'm way undercover.
                             JULIE
              Prove it!
                            BURNETT
              I knew her from way back. From
              time to time, you know... We'd get
              together. Mess around, you know?
                             JULIE
              Wrong.
     Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off.

                            BURNETT
              Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated.
              It's a man thing.
     She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly,
     catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from
     her.
                            BURNETT
              You know what? You don't wanna
              believe me? That's fine with me!
              Go it alone.
     Burnett heads toward the open door.     Julie's veneer drops
     as she shrinks to the floor.

              I saw it all... I watched him
              shoot her. Like she was nothing.
                     (trying to hold
                      it together)
              Please shut the door.
                            BURNETT
              You don't got any more golf clubs
              or bats, do you? Nothin' that you
              can swing at me, do you?
     She shakes her head.     He carefully steps forward.
                            BURNETT
              Then lemme introduce myself. I'm
              Mike Lowrey. And I'm here to help
              you.
                            JULIE
              You're not what I expected.
                            BURNETT
              Yeah, well neither are you.      You
              swing like Barry Bonds.
     Burnett nods and crosses over to help Julie to her feet.
                            BURNETT
              Alright. Look here, I need to
              know if you've called anybody.
              Or if you told anybody else where
              you are?
                               JULIE
              No.   Nobody.

                               BURNETT
              Good.     You got a back door?
     Julie nods, scoops up one of her dogs and grabbing
     another modeling bag off the table.
                            JULIE
              Where are we going?

                 Whoa! Fuck that. I'll only deal
                 with you. Otherwise, I'll take
                 my chances.
     Burnett's getting a "not again" look on his face when --
     KUH-BOOM!
     A SHOTGUN BLAST blows the front door open.       Clutching the
     bag, Julie races around the living room.

                                 BURNETT
                 Let's go!

                                 BURNETT
                 Fuck the dog!
     Burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner.       So
     he lunges over, scoops the dog up.

     As the remaining parts are kicked in from the outside.
     It's Casper, Noah and Kuni!

     BURNETT AND JULIE
     Racing through the apartment toward the back door,
     Burnett wheels with the GUN and FIRES just as Kuni rounds
     a corner with the SHOTGUN. The room ERUPTS with plaster
     spray and NOISE. Julie shrieks, and Burnett shoves her
     through the back door, then spins and FIRES. Kuni
     tumbles and dies from multiple hits.

               Fine time to bark. Where were you
               when they were comin' up the walk?
                      (beat)
               Shit. Bet they got a look at my
               license plates. If you saw him
               again, would you remember the guy
               who shot Max?

              So you choose.

      Burnett walks over to CHET, the doorman, a shifty little
      guy who's always got his hand out. He's sitting on a
      folding chair reading Penthouse Forum.
                             CHET
               Detective Burnett... Mr. Lowrey is
               out...
                             BURNETT
               He told me I could use the place

                             CHET
               Didn't mention it to me.
      Chet holds out his hand. Burnett slips him ten. Chet
      sneaks a peek over at the car, sees Julie putting on
      lipstick.
                              CHET
               Say.   How's that Mrs. Burnett?
      Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives
      him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough.
                             CHET
               Your children good? Mr. Lowrey
               says you got a regular baby
               factory goin' over there.

               Now that I think about it, Mr.
               Lowrey did mention something

      The door opens, Burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark
      for the light switch. Finally finds it.

               I forgot I had those switches moved.
               Welcome to Casa del Lowrey.
      Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but
      impressed by the stylish digs.
                             JULIE
               Nice... very nice. All this on a

               I uh... I invest.
                             JULIE
               Right. What was your last pick?
               A horse in the number two race at
               Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you
               an inside tip.


      CLOSE ON WINE RACK
      Which Julie runs her hands across labels.   All French.

               I'll ask you this only   once, Mike.
               Are you on the take?    And if you

               Fair enough. I'm not on the take.
               Satisfied? Good. So... why don't
               you make yourself at home? Here's
               the T.V. remote. Watch yourself
               some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or
               somethin'.

               Heh -- all these damn things look
               alike.
                      (switches it off)
               Well, gotta run... There's probably
               a couple of good steaks in the
               fridge for the dogs. Help yourself
               to whatever.

               I'll check on you in the morning.

               Where are you going?
                             BURNETT
               Uh, back to the P.D. I got
               paperwork back on my desk to go
               through that's about this high.
                      (to his armpits)
               And now there's you, so that makes

      To his neck.

               You mean, you're going to leave me

                             BURNETT
               Why shouldn't I? Are you a thief

               Of course not. And I'm not a call
               girl, either.
                               BURNETT
               I didn't ask.
                             JULIE
               I know you didn't. I just thought
               you should know.

               Okay. Important lesson. Julie's
               not a call girl. Can I go now?
                             JULIE
               Just one more thing.
      Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett.
      It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't
      reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.
                              JULIE
               Thank you.   For everything.
                             BURNETT
               Don't mention it.
      Burnett tries to break toward the door when the PHONE
      RINGS. Burnett stares at the phone, not knowing what
      to do.

               Hi. You're live with Lowrey.
               Leave it at the beep.
      The PHONE BEEPS.
                             YVETTE (V.O.)
               Miiike... it's Yvette... I know I
               told you I don't date cops. And I
               know I told you I wouldn't sleep
               with a man I wasn't going to marry.
               But I've been thinking -- and I
               remember when you said thinking was
               a dangerous thing -- so I started
               feeling... well, lonely. Remember
               when you gave me that key --
      Burnett charges over and shuts OFF the MACHINE.
                             BURNETT
               It's uh... It's uh...

               You don't have to explain.
      Finally, they've reached consensus.     Burnett grins and
      is out the door.
                             BURNETT
               Lock the door. Don't open it for
               anybody.

      As Burnett is racing back through to the car, he sees
      Chet behind the desk and stops.
                             BURNETT
               Listen, Chet. The girl? She's a

               about an hour. Do me a favor.

                             CHET
               You know, Mr. Burnett. I'm getting
               off in just a few minutes, so... I
               could watch the door if you like.
               You know. In a chair. I could
               just sit in it. Outside the door
               like cops do when they're guarding
               shit.
                             BURNETT
               Just keep an eye out.
      Heads for the door.
                             CHET
               Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you
               know? Just didn't work out. You
               know? Politics.

      Howard is in sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as
      his morning workout. Parked on either side of the hoop,
      Lowrey and Burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball
      and send it back to him.
                             BURNETT
               Chief. I tried to set   the girl
               up with a sketch artist  but she
               won't. I tried to get   her to come
               in and look at the mug  books and
               she won't come in.
                             HOWARD
               She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey.
      He tosses a brick.
                             BURNETT
               That's right. So let her deal
               with the real Mike Lowrey! Who,
               I might add, shoulda been there to
               take the call instead of runnin'
               off like a hot dog without any
               backup.
      Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all
      Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.
                             LOWREY
               Hey. I'm not the one who left a
               strange hooker alone in my
               apartment. You know, she's
               probably on the street sellin'
               all my shit as we speak.

               Yeah, I got a computer and you
               shouldn't touch it. It took me
               weeks to get it set up the way I
               want it and I don't want amateurs
               messing with it.

               the girl on Lowrey's super duper
               computer.
                             BURNETT
               So what about me? I can't    tell my
               wife I'm shacked up with a   female
               witness! Besides, I think    they
               made my car last night... I   gotta
               stay close to home, just in   case.
                            HOWARD
               Easy. Lowrey moves into your
               house. And you're on special
               assignment.
      Another brick.

               But what about us? The
               neighborhood's had all break-ins.

               Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my

               Baby. It's a Federal subpoena.
               I'm the witness. I'm the one who
               has to testify. Case closed. I'm

                He's dropping it off at the
                mechanic on the way to the
                airport. The engine  needs an
                overhaul... or will by the time
                he gets there.
      The Porsche heads down the block with a GRINDING of
      GEARS. Lowrey winces and heads for the Volvo when
      Theresa gets in his way.
                              THERESA
                Where you think you're going? I
                got a list here of things that
                Marcus was supposed --
                              LOWREY
                -- that Marcus was supposed to do.
                That's right. Marcus. Not Mike.
                'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with
                no time to waste.
      Lowrey's in the Volvo and pulling away as fast as he can.

      One of Miami's famous canals, derelict ships are docked
      and rusting. One such ship, an old freighter called the
      Mariana.

      and stairwells INTO a single, massive hold converted
      into a drug-processing lab. Huge, bakery-sized mixing
      BOWLS CHUG on one side of the room while lab workers form
      the doughy, cut heroin into pizza-sized forms, and shovel
      them into tractor ovens on the other side of the room.
      When the pies come out, more lab assistants re-form the
      pies into keys.


      ON FOUCHET
      He's dealing with his 26-year-old chemist named ELLIOT.
                             FOUCHET
               Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot.
               Why are we behind?
                             ELLIOT
               The cutting agent is highly
               volatile. You can't cook it like
               you would a pizza. I had to gear
               the ovens down to half-speed.
                             FOUCHET
               We already accounted for that,
               Elliot. It's in our fucking
               timetable. So what else?

      Elliot is uncomfortable. He looks back at WALLY, his
      stoned-looking assistant, before forging ahead.
                             ELLIOT
               There's too much moisture down
               here. The pies are taking longer
               to cook than we originally
               planned.
                              WALLY
               Yeah.   It's totally fucked.
                             FOUCHET
               You.  Shut up.
                      (back to Elliot)

               We're not making pizza.

                Can you bring me the lotion on

      Burnett enters.    Julie has a towel wrapped around her

      Julie, obviously free with her body, suddenly drops the
      towel and starts applying lotion. Burnett averts his
      eyes, turning around a full one-eighty, but finds himself
      facing a mirror. Oops. Looks left, another shiny
      surface.   Shit.

      He steps from the bathroom and stands outside the door.

                             JULIE
               The guy who killed Max. Now, he
               was looking for the heroin that
               Eddie stole from him... Max went
               to the party as a favor to you.

               So this isn't about Max's death
               at all. It's about dope.

      Burnett exits the closet to find Julie   brushing out her
      wet hair, wearing nothing but what she   described, a T-
      shirt and pair of Lowrey's boxers tied   up with a shoe
      string. This ensemble never looked so    good.

               look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook

      He heads out of the bedroom.

               Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all
               the pictures?
      Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of
      photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of
      Lowrey. All ego.

               That guy? Well, that's Marcus
               Burnett, my partner.
      Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds
      the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty
      frame, too.

               Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta
               guys. And I've seen a good number
               of their bedrooms, okay? But I've
               never seen... I mean, look at it.

      Burnett is cleaning up dog shit    from one of Lowrey's
      Persian rugs. The stain won't     come out. So Burnett
      tries a can that he's grabbed.     It foams. Julie appears
      with a pile of clean laundry in    hand.
                              BURNETT
                Your dog took a shit.
                              JULIE
                And you used Pledge to clean it
                up?

                Well, that makes a big difference.
                You just varnished that into the
                fabric. I'm sure it works great.
      Burnett doesn't quite know what    to do with the wad of
      dog poop in paper towels still    in his hand. Julie
      snatches it from him and heads    for the bathroom. Burnett
      follows. He suddenly realizes     that the clean clothes are
      his.

      turbing. A shirt of his has a large bleached area on it.

               Thought the kids deserved to
               know about the hero they have

               Husband? Theresa. He's your
               personal errand boy. You beep
               the poor S.O.B. every hour on
               the Goddamn hour? And why is
               it always about some useless
               bullshit that can wait until
               later. I mean, the guy's gotta
               job to do.

               You wanna know why I page him?
               Because until that phone rings,
               I don't know whether he's dead
               or alive. And lemme tell you.
               Those three minutes I'm waiting
               for him to call back? Those are
               the hardest three minutes for a

               drove your kids to school this

                Man, it's off. It was a joke.
                              BURNETT
                Hey, man. Don't mess with me!
                That's the mother of my children.
                Don't break up a happy home.

A132   INT. SAVE-MORE DRUGS - MORNING (Formerly Sc. 207)         A132

       Lowrey is annoyed. He holds the list Theresa just gave
       him as they walk down the aisle.
                              LOWREY
                Marcus, this is crazy. We are
                five minutes away from picking
                up this asshole and returning
                to our lives. And we're here
                doin' this shit. Where the fuck
                is it?
                             BURNETT
                Hey. Don't ask me to find it for
                you. You're the expert on my
                wife.

                              LOWREY
                You know, this is like some really
                bizarre shit that you're on right
                now. Your wife asked me to do
                this, and I'm doin' it. Besides,
                I'm you, remember?
                              BURNETT
                You don't even know where you're
                going. You're in the wrong aisle.
       Lowrey follows Burnett to the next aisle, where Burnett
       gestures to the wall of feminine hygiene products.
                              BURNETT
                You think you know what Theresa
                needs, man, but I do this every
                month.
                       (challenges)
                Just look for 'Fresh Days.'
       Lowrey moves ahead.   There's too much to look at.
                              LOWREY
                You're unbalanced. Listen, I
                read the parole jacket on this
                guy Noah. Armed robbery.
                Attempted murder. He's a violent
                offender somethin' like nine
                times. Sweet guy. Not a single
                drug bust on his sheet.
                              BURNETT
                So? He's a new recruit. Keep
                looking, will ya? 'Fresh Days.'

                              LOWREY
                You know, it is a damn shame she
                makes you buy this stuff.
                              BURNETT

                It's like shaving cream.

       shelf.

                Hey, man, look! You're not even

       A woman chooses this moment to walk by.

                That's a whole 'nother category

                spends all his time chasing
                pussy, you sure don't know much
                about the woo woo.

      Burnett and Lowrey park and pop the trunk.    Inside are
      guns and uniforms.
                             BURNETT
               What are we gonna be today? Postal
               Inspectors or Water and Power?
                             LOWREY
               Water and Power.

133   EXT. TRAILER - DAY                                          133
      Approaching are Burnett and Lowrey, but now they're
      dressed in shorts and T-shirts with bright orange vests
      and caps reading "Water and Power." And as Lowrey knocks
      on the door.

      CLOSE ON HEAVY LINK CHAIN
      Wrapped around a pink refrigerator.    It moves.
                             BURNETT
               What do you think the chain's for?
                             LOWREY
               I dunno. Maybe some kind of
               hurricane anchor.
      They knock again.    The chain jerks slightly.
                             BURNETT
               Well, the anchor just moved.
      Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first,
      it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and
      the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From
      around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and
      Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as
      a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at
      the deck.
      The door swings open.
      Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.

               Who are you?!
      Lowrey and Burnett heave, then turn. They're equally
      shocked to find a huge, three-hundred-pound WOMAN in
      nothing but her underwear.
                             BURNETT

               Listen. The cat don't belong to
               me. It belong to my brother. And
               I don't know where he is.
                             BURNETT
               That's too bad. Because his
               lion's tied to your trailer. So
               you gotta move the beast. Or move
               the trailer.

               I'll be ready in just a minute.
               I thought I'd have you tell --
      She stalls at the sight of Lowrey, a little spark of
      interest passes between them.

               They get nervous in new

               for the cleaning, but Mike

      Lowrey spots rings from glasses on the table.

      runs out with a Cole Hahn loafer in his mouth. They both
      follow him into the bedroom.

      A mysterious WOMAN in an overcoat, sunglasses and spiked
      heels enters.

               Mike?
      The Woman strips off the overcoat -- under which she's
      breathtakingly naked, save for a garter belt and
      stockings. She drapes the coat over the nearest chair.

               I'm feeling really nasty right
               now.

      Burnett is first to appear from the bedroom -- and his
      expression goes off the charts. Startled, the woman
      shrugs back into her coat.

                 up Max's shooter. Anyone got a
                 problem with that?
                               JULIE
                 I feel safer now.
       She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's
       about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door-
       way and gets into his face.
                               LOWREY
                 You are ruining my life!
                               BURNETT
                 Yeah, well this case is messin'

       The ultimate Miami night scene. A long line of local and
       Hip and cool couples are waiting. Lowrey and Burnett
       appear at the front of the line, coolly flashing their
       badges to a hipster couple.

                Hey, man. Got some bad news.
                Your car got busted into. There's
                some uniformed boys in the parking
                lot wanting to ask you some
                questions.
       Pissed and panicked, the hipster pair head for the
       parking lot, while Lowery and Burnett take their place
       near the front of the line.

      Julie, still dressed for the evening, paces back and
      forth. Frustrated, she rips the tag from her dress, and
      sits back down at the computer. She plays with the
      keyboard and Noah's mug shot pops back into view. She
      stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in
      front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death
      replaying itself in her mind.
      Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and
      exits.

      on cruise control, this club massed with people.

      High above the room, Fouchet looks out upon the dance
      floor with both Noah, Casper, and Ferguson behind him.

               My three little angels told me I'd
               get a visit from the cops tonight

                      (turns and orders)
               When they split up, we'll drop
               the tall one and get the other
               one to lead us to the girl.

      Lowrey and Burnett move to the bar.   There's a huge
      fishtank behind it.
                             LOWREY
               I say we split the room in half.
               Make our own moves. Hook back up
               at the bar in twenty minutes.

               Sounds good to me.
      Lowrey moves off and Burnett turns to the female

      Julie pulls up in Lowrey's Porsche. Before the valet
      can get to the door, she's opening Lowrey's glove box.
      In it there's a pistol. Julie mulls it over before
      removing it and stuffing it in her purse.

               I gotta make a pitstop.

      And, believe it or not, the other side of the fishtank
      behind the bar. Burnett's at the urinal, blissfully
      relieving himself when Casper appears at his side.
      There's that awkward men-don't-talk-at-the-urinal moment
      until Burnett leans over...
                                BURNETT

      Which Casper wraps around Burnett's head.       Burnett gags.

                 Okay, hardon!    Tell me where the
                 girl is!
      Casper slams Burnett into the mirror. Burnett struggles,
      reaching for anything, he comes up with the towel dis-
      penser, rips it from the wall and starts pounding over
      Casper's head.

      Lowrey sips on a beer, totally unaware of what's

      Burnett rips the bag off his head, reaches for his gun.
      But Casper's there, lunging into him and lifting him up
      and into the fishtank.

      He's been watching the  fish in the tank, but turns back
      toward the bar just at  the moment of Burnett's impact.
      The tank cracks on the  bathroom side and water begins
      draining, unbeknownst  to Lowrey.

      Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea-
      weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding
      across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching
      for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late.
      Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and
      squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett
      in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's
      head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett
      picks up his gun.

       Lowrey, standing at the bar and making conversation with
       one of the club beauties.

      LOWREY
      Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the
      frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah.
      Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun
      skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't
      find it. But --

      got a clear shot at Julie. He raises his gun, only to
      find Burnett's pistol at his ear.

      across the road and crunches them. Noah throws a SHOTGUN
      over the back seat of his car and FIRES through the rear

       Noah's car clips the pumps. A geyser of gasoline sprays
       into the sky. Noah recovers from the roll. Throws his
       weight into the jammed door. It opens on the second
       shove.

       Just getting out of the car as the station blows.    They
       shield themselves against the explosion.

                There goes our only lead to the
                dope. We better call Howard.

                That's it. That's it.   You're
                both crazy.
       Julie takes a few steps away before she decides to give
       them the other barrel.
                              JULIE
                Protect and serve. Sound familiar?
                Isn't that what you're supposed to
                do? 'Cuz I'd like to know whose
                butt you're protecting.

                I think we protected your
                uninvited butt pretty good back
                there.
                              JULIE
                All you care about is getting your
                dope back. No, that's not all,
                you care about getting it back in
                a way that shows how fucking macho
                and tough you are. It's all some
                big testosterone contest. Well,
                fuck that.
       As Julie walks in one direction, Burnett blows off in the
       other.
                 BURNETT                           LOWREY
       No more. Fuck this. I'm               Chill, I'll handle it.
       not goin' with it... No, I'm                (starts after
       out. I'm out. Somethin's                     Julie)
       wrong with her. Crazy woman!          Julie! Just wait a
                                             minute!
       Burnett keeps moving and grousing while Lowrey chases
       Julie down and snags her by the arm.
                              LOWREY
                Hey, hey. Just relax!
                       (looks for words)
                Okay. It's true this whole thing
                started with missing drugs. But
                somebody I cared about. A lot.
                She got killed. And I'm not gonna
                lay down until this guy is dead
                or put away... And I promise you,
                we'll take care of you.
                              JULIE
                That's what I'm afraid of.
       Once again, Julie pulls away. But Lowrey's got her
       tight... and close. He digs deep.
                              LOWREY
                Hey. What do I gotta say?     I
                need you, okay?
                       (then for real)
                I need you.
       Magic words.   Julie's swayed, despite herself.

       Police units surround  -- flashing lights. Julie is
       shaken, waiting in the  back of a police unit. Meanwhile,
       Ruiz and Sanchez join  Burnett and Lowrey at the trunk of
       the toasted car. The   fire crew crowbars open the lid.
       The trunk gives way to  a ghastly, toxic smell. Everyone
       gags.
                                BURNETT
                 Jesus.   What kinda shit was in

                 Smells like some kinda chemical.
                               BURNETT
                 We'll get a sample and drop it
                 back at the lab. Meanwhile, why
                 don't you two go on back to Club

       As Lowrey is checking the upstairs, he finds himself
       staring in on the sleeping kids.
                                 LOWREY
                 One day, bro.    Gotta get yourself
                 some of them.
       Lowrey hears SOBBING. He gently shuts the kids' door
       and heads down the hall to the:

       Where Theresa sits amongst boxes of new clothes.   Lowrey
       gives a polite rap on the door.
                               LOWREY
                Hey, hey.   That's not cryin' I

                       (wipes tears)
                Oh, it's nothing... I just bought
                some clothes. It's been so long
                since I bought anything nice...
                I just wanted something to wear
                for Marcus when he got home. But
                nothing looks right...

                        again)
                He's slipping away from me, Mike.
                I can feel it.

                Theresa. Listen to me. Nobody's
                slipping away from you. Especially
                not Marcus. You can take my word
                on that... As for the clothes...
       Lowrey pulls a random item out of a box.   It's hideous.
                              LOWREY
                Okay. Just a minor fashion
                faux paux. Those cappuccinos
                at lunch can do that to you...

       lowers his nose to the cushions. The smell gets worse.

                I'm really sorry about the dog
                pee. They must be traumatized by

                for new cushions.

      nightgown.

               Do you always come to bed with your

               So I'm dressed and ready. It's
               okay. I've done it before.
                             JULIE
               Really. You think Marcus would
               wear clothes to bed while on

               Well Marcus. He's very   something
               ... sexy. And the way I   came in
               tonight, he was throwing  everybody
               this way and that and he  took
               control.

               listen. I got something you'll
               want a piece of.


187   INT. PORSCHE (BURNETT'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - NIGHT               187
      GRINDING GEARS, Burnett stops around the corner from his
      house. He turns OFF the IGNITION and turns to Julie.
                             BURNETT
               I got some jewelry for you.
      Before Julie can respond, Burnett's cuffing her to the
      steering wheel.
                            JULIE
               You prick! First you don't want
               me. Then you drag me out...

                       it)
               Oh, wait. I get it. You're one
               of those post-adolescent assholes
               who didn't get any car sex in
               high school --
                             BURNETT
               Just shut the fuck up. I won't be
               long. Try and keep out of sight.
      Burnett's out of the car with the keys. Julie yanks on
      the handcuffs, then goes for the glove box. But this
      time it's empty.


188   INT. SEDAN - FERGUSON AND CASPER - NIGHT                   188
      Casper spots Burnett nearing the house.
                             CASPER
               There's our guy. Watch him.

189   INT. BURNETT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           189
      Lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa, the back of which
      faces the window. Exhausted, he turns off light and
      closes his eyes. A beat. Burnett's face pops up
      furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass,
      looking for evidence of adultery. He can't see Lowrey
      asleep on the couch. His head drops below the window
      frame, only to reappear in another window. Seeing
      nothing, he moves on.


190   EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - NIGHT                                 190
      Burnett skulks into the side yard.

191   EXT. THERESA'S BEDROOM WINDOW - BURNETT'S POV              191
      The light in Theresa's bedroom is on. He sees her sil-
      houette against the curtain getting undressed.

192   EXT. SIDE YARD - BURNETT                                   192
      He climbs the trellis to second story; boosts himself
      onto ledge, inches along. Stops to peer into a window
      when the ledge under his feet crumbles and...

       falls. Landing flat on his back on the awning. His eyes
       close with a look that says "saved." But then as he
       moves. Something CREAKS.

       Theresa hears SOMETHING and runs to the door and calls
       out.

                                 THERESA
                 Mike!
       In a heartbeat, Lowrey charges into Theresa's room in his
       underwear.
                               LOWREY
                 What's the matter?
                               THERESA
                 I heard a noise... I think
                 someone's outside...

A194   EXT. AWNING - BURNETT                                      A194
       Seemingly stuck, once again, he attempts to move.
       Another, even LOUDER CREAK, then --

       AWNING

       gives way. And Burnett crashes loudly into the garbage
       cans underneath. Lids and cans go every which way.

B194   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT                                      B194
       A lid rolls down and into the street.

       He crawls to his feet and as he looks up at the damage
       he's done --

      He sees Lowrey in his underwear and Theresa in her night-
      gown as they part the curtains and look out.

               I come get you.


198   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                     198
      Lowrey takes gun from holster, slams in clip.

199   EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT                                      199
      Lowrey switches off the porch lights as he exits house,
      gun ready. Without warning, Burnett leaps from the
      bushes onto Lowrey's back.

      LOWREY'S GUN
      Tumbles into the flower bed. Lowrey reels with     an elbow,
      dropping Burnett to the lawn. But Burnett rolls     and
      clips Lowrey's legs. Lowrey falls. Crawls for      his gun.
      Gets hold of it, turns and is ready to fire when    --


      CAR
      drives past.   The headlights, revealing Burnett.
                              LOWREY

      Lowrey and the two roll around on the lawn.

               She's in the car. Got her cuffed
               to the steering wheel.
      Lowrey could kill now. He's on his feet, grabbing
      Burnett by the collar and shoving him up against the
      front door.

               handled. In the meantime, you

                 I was thinking that... maybe I
                 could see your gun. See, we
                 don't allow guns up in the
                 apartments. Mr. Lowrey usually
                 checks his, here, at the desk
                 with me... You want me to check
                 yours?
       Burnett pulls his gun. But doesn't hand it to Chet.        He
       sticks it in Chet's face.

                Okay. All I know is his name.
                Foo-shay, I think. Got this

                there was quick cash for whoever
                had the balls enough to hook up
                with him. I swear, man, watchin'
                your house was my first gig for
                the guy.

       Burnett stands over the Henchman and lifts his defeated
       chin to face him. Burnett has it in him to give the guy
       one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised
       face proves punishment enough.
                             BURNETT
                Yeah. I guess you're tellin'
                the truth.

       Two old codgers are trading stories in front of JOJO, a
       white boy with rasta dreadlocks.
                               BURNETT
                Hey, Jojo.
       Through the office window, Jojo sees Burnett and sud-
       denly bolts out the rear door and runs smack dab into
       Lowrey, who body checks him back up against the office
       door.
                              LOWREY
                Good runnin' into you, Jojo.

       Now Burnett has pushed Jojo up onto the sink.   Lowrey
       hangs back, vibrating with anticipation.
                              BURNETT
                Hey, calm down. A little rap,
                that's all. We're lookin' for
                someone who can step on a
                shitload of heroin. And do it
                real fast, and real well.
                We're lookin' for a pro.
                              JOJO
                I'm in the rubber business now.
                              BURNETT
                We're not playin' around with
                you, Jojo. You know what we
                want.

                              JOJO
                I'm tellin' you straight up,
                like a straight fuckin' arrow,
                okay? I'm straight as a board.
                I'm so straight it's fuckin'
                sick.
                              BURNETT
                Now there's a lotta dope, Jojo.
                Who can cut it quick?
                              JOJO
                You mean, cut it... cut it up,
                yeah. I don't know anything about
                anything.
       Lowrey's had it.   He pulls his gun and pushes in.

                             BURNETT
               What are you doin', man?
      As Burnett tries to intercede, they talk over each other.

               LOWREY                           BURNETT
       We don't got time for            Mike. Chill with that.

       shit...
         (reaches behind his
          back)
       Wait. Wait.
       Burnett pushes in one last time and tries to talk Lowrey
       back. Lowrey acts like he lost it. He pulls another
       gun and points it at Burnett.
               LOWREY                           BURNETT
       Back up. I'm gonna bust          Right on. Jojo, you're
       your fuckin' ass too.            on your own.

      Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey.
      Each is clearly tired of the other. The silence is
      deadly until Julie breaks the silence.
                             JULIE
               So where's the coffee and donuts?
                                BURNETT
               What?
                             JULIE
               I thought that was the usual menu
               when cops were on stakeout. A
               little caffeine for the heart.
               Some sugar-coated dough fried in
               day old grease.
                             LOWREY
               Man. Will you get off this?
               You're making me sick.
                             JULIE
               Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All     these
               hours on the case, you must    miss
               Theresa's home cooking.
                      (near Lowrey's ear)
               Bet last night she fixed you    up
               something yummy and left it    in
               the microwave for you.
      Burnett starts to steam.
                              LOWREY
               Yeah.   Somethin' yummy.
                             JULIE
               I imagine there was something
               yummy waiting for you when you

      But Burnett's face    ignites with headlights at their
      rear. Doors open.      Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror.
      He sees two private    security cops named DE SOUZA and
      TOWNE. They split     and approach either side of the
      unmarked sedan.
                                LOWREY
               Oh, man.     It's the fuckin' pretend

      Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...
                             TOWNE
               Well, what do we have back here?
               Looks like we got us two pimps
               and a hooker.
                             DE SOUZA
               Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does
               us both we'll let you leave with
               your pride intact.

                             LOWREY
               Excuse me. One moment.
                      (rolls up the window)
               Let's fuck with these bozos.
      Burnett nods his approval.   Lowrey lowers the window.
                             LOWREY
               Now, where were we?
                             TOWNE
               Outta the car. Hands where we can
               see 'em. Feet spread.
      Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett
      respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out
      and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking
      Burnett's shoulders.
                             BURNETT
               Oh, that's not how you frisk a
               potential lawbreaker. You gotta
               start at the waistband. See if
               he's carrying a piece.
      Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to
      Burnett's waistband where he feels a --
                             TOWNE
               Gun!
      Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces
      drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.

               helpless pimps and a call girl...
               But it would be even worse if you
               shot two policemen and their
               witness on a stakeout.
      Looks pass between the hobby cops.

               Ooh, look at that. It's a
               detective's shield! All gold and
               shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't
               fuck with somebody who had one of
               these in his pocket. So... Let's
               see. I guess that makes us

                             BURNETT
               Not.
      He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns,
      unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.
                             BURNETT
               Now, some rent-a-cops have
               licenses to carry weapons,  where
               others do not. Which might   you
               be? You wouldn't happen to   have
               those permits handy, would  you?
      From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see
      that they don't.
                             JULIE
               Guess we know the answer to that
               one.

               operation. That's why they
               called their company Desilu.
               Desi was first. Lucy second.
               Get it? Desi-Lu?

      Coral Gables stakeout. Julie's passed out and, once
      again, sleeping in the rear of the car. In the glow of
      the faltering streetlights and the approaching dawn,
      she couldn't look more beautiful. And from his post in
      the driver's seat, he's looking at her with a longing
      that goes well beyond lust. Then Burnett breaks the
      silence.
                                BURNETT
               Two o'clock.     The red Civic.

      Elliot exits the house in a hurry. Hair wet from a
      shower and fresh change of clothes. He fumbles with the
      keys to his Civic, gets in and drives.

                             JULIE

      Lowrey has the keys in the ignition and is stomping on
      the gas.

               Yeah. Tell Howard to assemble
               the troops. We just made the

      Typical pandemonium. Theresa is making/serving breakfast
      while the TV BLARES. Quincy is channel surfing on the
      TV when he comes up with the news footage of the
      explosion, followed by more footage of Lowrey, Julie, and
      Burnett at the scene.

               In our continuing report on police
               violence, the most recent incident
               involving two Miami P.D. officers
               remains unexplained by department
               spokesmen. This high-speed chase
               was captured two nights ago by
               our Live Copter 9 news team. And
               while the driver was killed, both
               police officers involved in the
               incident seemed to escape without
               injury.
                             THERESA
               Kids, you go over to the
               neighbors' house. I'll be right
               back.

      Theresa enters building, ignores Chet and heads straight
      for bank of elevators.
                             CHET
               Lady, all visitors must be
               announced.
                             THERESA
               Announce this!
      In a motherly flash, she's got Chet by the ear and she's
      dragging him over to the elevator. He yowls the whole
      way until he sticks his master pass-card in the elevator
      lock. Theresa lets  go.

      Julie is framed in the bedroom doorway, somewhat sadly
      watching Burnett and Lowrey scramble to get ready for
      the bust.

               So, I guess when you get back, it's
               gonna be over.
                             LOWREY
               That's the plan... So, Mike. Loan
               some of those ass kicking clothes.

      And there's Theresa. Julie's hip.

               Which one do you want?     The tall
               one or the short one?
                             THERESA
               Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em
               both. But it's the short one I'm

      She pushes past.

      Burnett's stripped to his pants and T-shirt. While
      Lowrey's down to his white boxer shorts. He's talking
      and wiping down his gun with a rag.

                Wait. I know why. Because you
                said you needed me. Jesus, who's

      Julie slams a fist into Lowrey's face. The elevator
      doors shut. Then Burnett comes hauling down the
      corridor with Theresa at his heels. He pounds the
      elevator button.

       Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car. All three bad
       guys pile in and the CAR PEELS RUBBER just as Lowrey
       makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't
       even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear,
       he appears from the building, turns the corner out the
       door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off
       bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.

      Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another
      direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the other.

238   INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY                                  238
      MUZAK. Old ladies getting their hair blued and curled
      when -- BANG! Fouchet and the gang enter. Curlers fly.
      Screams!


      LOWREY
      enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES.
      BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey
      ends up under an old lady's dress.

239   EXT. OCEAN BLVD. (SOUTH BEACH)                           239
      Exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a
      crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling their
      way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments
      behind, pushing his way through the same path.

                                                            103.
240   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          240
      Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first
      car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab
      and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of
      the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before.
      He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the
      dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and
      Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.

241   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          241
      But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no
      gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets
      into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.


242   INSIDE CAB                                                 242
      Ferguson aims his pistol upward. He's about to fire
      into the roof when Julie shoves him. GUNSHOTS RING
      out sideways.

243   EXT./INT. CAB                                              243
      BULLETS RIP to either side of Burnett. Then Fouchet
      stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and
      onto the pavement.

      CLOSE ON BURNETT
      He rolls, makes it to one knee.   But his other leg
      gives way.


      FOUCHET
      He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The cab barrels
      at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard,
      about to become instant roadkill.
      Then --

244   EXT. STREET                                                244
      From out of nowhere, here comes Lowrey. Dashing out
      across the boulevard and snatching his partner from the
      deadly grille of the cab.

      TAXI CAB
      hauls on by. Leaving Burnett and Lowrey in a heap of
      their own, both trying to catch their breath.
                               LOWREY
                 Don't ever say I wasn't there for
                 you.

245   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - DAY                           245
      TAC teams and uniform cops swarm around their cars.
      All waiting as Burnett and Lowrey arrive in their
      unmarked car. Howard approaches.

                               HOWARD
                 It's about fuckin' time.
                               BURNETT
                 We lost the girl.
                               HOWARD
                 But you found the dope, right?
                 So let's go get it back.
      A bicycle BELL RINGS. Heads turn. And here comes a
      BOY on his bike, serpentining his way through the maze
      of cars and cops until he gets to Lowrey, Burnett, and
      Howard.
                               BOY
                 Which one of you's Lowrey?   I got
                 somethin' for him.
                               LOWREY
                 At least I'm me again.
                        (hand out)
                 I'm Lowrey.
      From his back pocket, the boy extracts a cellular flip
      PHONE. He hands it to Lowrey. He presses the power
      button and, almost instantly, it RINGS.
                                LOWREY
                         (presses send)
                 Yeah.   This is Lowrey.

246   INT. FREIGHTER - DOPE LAB - DAY                           246

      Fouchet is revealed at the other end of the cellular
      call.

               I have something for you to listen
               to.
      Fouchet lifts his PISTOL and FIRES a single shot.   BAM!
      INTERCUT WITH --

               chemist. Now, I have but four
               hours left to make my deal. Fuck
               with my timetable and the next
               bullet kills the girl.
      Julie is gagged and sitting on the floor, scared
      shitless.

249   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - LOWREY                         249
      He's in a vice.    Duty or the girl.   Then --
                             LOWREY
               You twisted motherfucker...
                      (then...)

               kill you.

               The snitch who tipped us to the
               dope lab? Turns out to be a
               bogus address.
                             BURNETT
               Bogus address?

               How'd he know we were gearing up
               to go? It's like he's known all
               along where we're gonna be and
               when.

                             LOWREY
               You know that once he sells the
               dope, he's gonna kill her just
               like he did Max.
                             BURNETT
               Three little angels. Julie kept
               talking about his three little
               angels.
      A barkeeper appears with two beers.   Burnett automati-

               It was a birthday party... You
               know, after hours. Just the
               civilian staff... We were drinking.
               And everybody. They all had boy
               friends or their husbands.
                             LOWREY

               He was so nice to me. He said I
               was beautiful, too. I guess I
               wanted to believe him...
                      (then ashamed,
                       starting to shake)
               He took some horrible pictures of
               me. I don't remember any of it.
               I'd had too much to drink. I
               wondered if he'd drugged me.
               Later... he threatened to show
               them to my boys... my little
               angels. Said he'd pin the
               pictures up on the grade school
               bulletin boards for all their
               classmates to see if I didn't do
               what he wanted.

               could make the case. And then when
               the department gave the air
               conditioning to Mr. Orona...

               rips off drug dealers? A man
               like that ain't scared of nobody.
               Not the police. Not you guys.
               Nobody.

               Yeah. Yeah. I think that's it.

      The CAMERA ZEROES IN ON his cellular phone.    The power
      light is green.

               They're turning north onto the
               Orange Highway.
                             BURNETT
               We can make better time if we cut
               across the Biscayne Bridge.

263   EXT. BISCAYNE BRIDGE - DAY                                  263
      The van cuts across traffic, barely making the ramp which
      swirls up onto the bridge.

264   EXT. ORANGE COAST HIGHWAY NORTH - DAY                       264
      The dope convoy rolls OVER the CAMERA.

      AIRFIELD
      The trucks roll toward an old airport which consists of a
      small, pilot's terminal and four or so hangars spread out
      over the ten acre site.

      Two henchmen for the buyer open the yawning doors of this
      massive, five-story hangar to reveal a C-123 cargo
      aircraft. The convoy of trucks enters.

268   EXT. ORANGE HIGHWAY - DAY                                  268

      THROUGH a floor-mounted SPOTTING SCOPE we see the last of
      the trucks roll into Hangar 3 and two of the buyer's
      henchmen shut the doors.

                               BURNETT
                 That's it. That's where they're
                 making the deal.
      Burnett swivels the spotting scope.

      Fouchet shakes  hands with the BUYER. Upon which time one
      forklift begins  to drive pallets full of cash from the
      open cargo door  of the aircraft while another drives
      pallets full of  dope.

                               BUYER
                 Three hundred million and very,
                 very fresh. Too much to count,
                 eh?

                 Who's the bimbo?
                               FOUCHET
                 Simply part of another
                 transaction.

      The operation moves swiftly. Dope pallets for cash
      pallets. Smooth, just like the original heist. Two fuel
      trucks are moved in to gas up the aircraft.

272   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                        272
      Rounding the corner from Hangar 3 -- here comes the
      garbage truck. CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS Ruiz and
      Sanchez at the helm with both Lowrey and Burnett hanging
      from the sides. All of them wear dirty white jumpsuits
      and protective masks.

273   EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        273

      The two Buyer's henchmen stiffen at the sight of the
      oncoming truck. Their hands slip inside their coats to
      MP5-Ks slung under their armpits. But --

274   EXT. HANGAR 3 - GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY                        274
      It veers and swings over toward two nearby dumpsters.
      With Sanchez keeping a wary eye on the two bad guys and
      Ruiz to operate the hydraulics, Burnett and Lowrey drop
      from the truck and do their best working-for-the-city
      amble over to the dumpster. Business as usual. They
      wheel it over and position it in front of the two lifting
      forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and
      dumped into the truck.

      CLOSE ON DUMPSTER
      As it lowers, the gearing seems to get hung up. The
      hydraulics' arms won't work, leaving the dumpster stuck
      in the air.

      RUIZ AND SANCHEZ
      Begin speaking Spanish, one blaming the other for this
      fiasco. Angry words. Finally, Ruiz has had enough.       He
      tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off    as
      if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right     for
      the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving    and
      spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing
      what to think. Ready for anything when --
      CLICK CLICK -- GUNS COCKING.
      Both Burnett and Lowrey are right behind the henchmen with
      guns at the base of their necks.

      The Buyer buckles himself into the pilot's seat of the C-
      123. His crew shuts the cargo hatches and he gives a
      pleased salute to Fouchet. The ENGINES TURN OVER and the
      propellers move. Meanwhile --

277   INT. HANGAR 3 - TRUCK ENGINES                              277
      START. Loaded with cash, they're ready to go.   Fouchet
      gives the signal to open the doors.

      CASPER AND FERGUSON
      Move to open the doors. They give a good shove.   Still
      nothing. So they bang and shout.
                            CASPER
               Hey! Wake up out there!     Open
               it up!

278   EXT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        278

      The garbage truck barrels through the rear wall,
      instantly colliding with the left wing section of
      aircraft. The wheel assembly buckles and the aircraft
      twists onto one wing. Fuel spills.

      Pop up Burnett and Lowrey. MP5-Ks in hand. They BLAZE
      the cargo doors and CUT DOWN the rest of the Buyer's
      henchmen.

      CASPER AND FERGUSON
      charge.   GUNS BLASTING.

      BULLETS

      RIP across the dumpster, moving up into the truck cab.
      Ruiz and Sanchez dive and roll to either side.
      Meanwhile, the sparks ignite the spilled fuel.
                              LOWREY
                Move it or lose it!
      Burnett and Lowrey climb from the dumpster and run.
      Casper and Ferguson have a clear shot. They level and
      aim, but...
      KUH-WHOOM!
      The FUEL TANK on the aircraft EXPLODES. The truck drivers
      dive for cover. Charging for the open hole in the wall.

               Remember us?
      The two bad guys turn with their guns. The flames
      igniting their already battered faces. But they don't
      turn fast enough. Both cops FIRE in unison. Ferguson
      and Casper fall. PULL BACK --


287   INT. HANGAR 3 - WIDE ANGLE                                   287

      and deeper into the hangar. The smoke is getting thicker
      and swirling with the burning cash.

290   INT. HANGAR 3 - BURNETT AND LOWREY                           290

      Appear Lowrey and Burnett. Twenty yards apart and
      closing. Guns carefully aimed. Fouchet pulls Julie
      close.

                              FOUCHET
                I was going to fuck her, then
                kill her. Now it looks like I'm
                only going to do the latter.
                              LOWREY
                Either we O.D. on the air or
                the whole place blows. We're
                dying anyway.
                              BURNETT
                Let her go and you'll walk. You
                can keep the dope and the money.
                       (coughs)
                Just the girl and we all get out
                of here.
                              FOUCHET
                What if I don't have the key.
                              JULIE
                He threw it in the --

                Shut up! It's gone. She's dead.
                Unless you move aside.
      Burnett eases further right. Gun carefully aimed. His
      eyes are stinging. Lowrey goes left. But he's lowering
      his gun.

      FOUCHET
      Pulls Julie closer. Gun at her head. Looking to
      Burnett. While Lowrey is nodding to Julie. Nodding

      They appear.   Alive and well. Big grins, helping Burnett
      to his feet.   Brushing him off.
                             BURNETT
               Hey, hey...
                      (then with a smile)
               Let's go get our jobs back.

      BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/24/94 PM                             119.
301   EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY                                     301
      The front door opens and all the little Burnetts come
      screaming out...
                              BURNETT KIDS
                Daddy Daddy Daddy the hero!!!
      ... into the arms of their father.     He gathers them all
      into one big hug.
                                BURNETT
                Daddy's home!
      Behind Burnett appear Lowrey and Julie, arm in arm.
      The kids run to...

                              BURNETT KIDS
                Uncle Mike, Uncle Mike.
      Then...
                                BURNETT
                Baby!
      Theresa framed in the front doorway, looking smashing in
      the outfit Lowrey picked out for her. Burnett ambles up
      the walk into her arms. They hug and kiss, Theresa
      tossing a wink Lowrey's way.
                              LOWREY
                Manana, partner. Peace. Okay,
                kids. Pile in. And watch the
                leather and windows this time?
                              JULIE
                You got a real way with kids,
                Lowrey.

                              LOWREY
                You see anybody complaining?
                                BURNETT
                Hey.    Where are the kids goin'?
                              THERESA
                Didn't you know? We got us a new
                babysitter.
      She kisses him.
                                BURNETT
                You mean...
                              THERESA
                It's quality time, Marcus.

       Burnett shuts the door ON the CAMERA.    The screen GOES
       TO BLACK. Then UNDER CREDITS:

       Little Megan is on the potty.   She catches Lowrey as
       he passes.

            FADE IN:

            LANDSCAPES

            A rusted Chevy El Camino drives against dissolving Louisiana
            landscapes - broad, barren, pounded by the rain.

            I/E. EL CAMINO, TRAVELING - DUSK

            Occasional oncoming headlights illuminate the driver's face:
            Tense, course features, thick beard... He's BUD CARTER, 31.

            AN INTERSTATE SIGN PASSES ON THE RIGHT: "WHISKEY BAY"

            Bud pulls onto a dirt road, into a TRAILER PARK and stops.

            INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - DUSK

            TITLE IN: Denham Springs, Louisiana. 1983.

            We're staring at three sacks of sample unmounted EMERALDS,
            set on a filthy counter.

                                SOUTHERN MAN'S VOICE O.S.
                      Now these here are Brazilian, from Bahia.
                      Deep cuts. Damn good. These is India,
                      paler, but also good. And this is
                      Columbia. From them limestone caves up in
                      Muzo.

            WIDEN to reveal NADY GRACE, 35. A tattooed man with thinning
            hair, leading Bud through the sale...

                                GRACE
                      Now them first two, you gonna get your
                      money's worth.
                          (re: COLUMBIA EMERALDS)
                      This one here's more expensive, but
                      that's 'cause there ain't a nigger flaw
                      in one of 'em. They hard as steel and
                      emerald green as emerald green fuckin'
                      comes. Lookit that.

                                BUD
                      That's nice.

                                GRACE
                      That's the real McCoy. That's what that
                      is.

                                BUD
                      Tell you what... Bag 'em all. The
                      market's got a hard-on for this shit.

                                GRACE
                      I hear that.
                          (across the room)
                      Jake, get on it.

            ACROSS THE ROOM are two other men -- JAKE and DOUG. Ex-cons
            at a table, riffing through Bud's cash.

            A CURTAIN YANKS BACK and RAY WHEELER, 29, enters. Dope-thin,
            bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray
            clicks on the TV and opens a beer. 

            TV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception.

                                NEWSCASTER
                      ...And today, thirty-one year old Gary
                      Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of
                      insanity, to charges of second-degree
                      murder in the slaying of accused sex
                      offender, Jeffrey Doucett.

            Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar. Using a
            credit card, Ray starts chopping lines. The SOUND continues
            throughout the scene... 

                                NEWSCASTER (TV)
                      ...District Court Judge Frank Salia,
                      scheduled the trial one year to the day
                      after Doucett was first arrested.

            Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of
            emeralds. Bud SEES packed carelessly underneath, uncut
            DIAMONDS.

                                BUD
                      What do you got there? Diamonds?

                                GRACE
                      That's thirty grand. Out the door. You
                      interested?

                                BUD
                      Ain't got the scratch right now. But I am
                      interested.

            And the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent...

                                NEWSCASTER O.S.
                      ...As a result of numerous threats made
                      weeks ago, tight security surrounded the
                      courthouse. However, missing from today's
                      hearing, was the arresting officer.

            Bud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last
            statement. He sneaks a look.

                                NEWSCASTER
                      From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office...

            A wave of static scrambles the picture. When it clears...

                                NEWSCASTER O.S.
                      ...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter.

            Bud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger
            photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM.

            EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME 

            Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance.

            INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 

            TV IN: Signal wavers. It's archive footage of Baton Rouge
            Airport. A prisoner, JEFFREY DOUCETT, escorted by police.

                                NEWSCASTER
                      Doucett was being extradited to Baton
                      Rouge.

            Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping. Watches the TV.

            Grace is bagging emeralds.

            Jake and Doug count cash.

            Bud keeps the TV in sight. Quick glances. Mind racing.

            TV IN: The procession moves past a row of pay phones. At one
            phone, a discreet figure, GARY PLAUCHE, turns...

                                NEWSCASTER
                      The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood
                      waiting at the terminal. As Doucett
                      walked by, Plauche turned, raised a
                      handgun...and fired.

            Bud's vision is suddenly obscured when Grace steps forward
            with the emeralds in a satchel.

                                GRACE
                      Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues.
                      Wholesale. Twenty large.

            Sudden GUNSHOTS and SCREAMS on the TV. Everyone turns...

            TV IN: Jeffrey Doucett lies dead as POLICE wrestle Gary
            Plauche to the ground amid chaos.

                                NEWSCASTER
                      Lieutenant Carter was unavailable for
                      comment.

            TIGHT ON RAY'S EYES, intense, watching the footage. 

            As Bud stuffs the satchel in his coat, WE SEE what Ray
            sees...

            TV IN: Bud, POLICE BADGE AROUND HIS NECK, arresting Plauche.

            ON RAY, slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to Bud.
            And again. EYES LOCK, THEY BOTH KNOW.

                                RAY
                      Motherfucker, he's a cop.

            Bud yanks a .45.

            And everything happens at once.

            A SUDDEN GUNSHOT and Jake FIRES again.

            Wood splinters as Bud FIRES back.

            Jake is HIT in the throat. A SECOND SHOT in the forehead - he
            SLAMS against the window, cracking it...

            INT. PLUMBER'S VAN - SAME 

            Among surveillance equipment, sits Bud's crew: TODD SHEPARD,
            DAVID MARANDINO and DALE COBB.

            Gunshots ECHO.

                                SHEPARD
                      Fuck! Go! Go!

            Marandino, behind the wheel, SLAMS his foot on the gas.

            INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 

            A SHOT ZIPS across Bud's back; he SPINS off the table.

            On his knees, Doug is firing a .32. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM.

            Bud FIRES a burst through Doug's chest, dropping him.

            A HOLE EXPLODES beside Bud's head -- Grace FIRING a .45 -- as
            Ray SCREAMS and runs out the door.

            EXT. TRAILER PARK, VAN - SAME 

            Marandino winds through gears, as Ray hits the yard
            running... 

            POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Marandino swings the wheel hard,
            SLAMS INTO RAY -- launching him through trash bins, into the
            mud.

            Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs.
            Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door...

            EXT. GRACE'S TRAILER PARK - SAME 

            Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard.

            I/E. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME 

            Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer. .45
            held tight, he runs out after Grace.

            ACROSS THE YARD

            the chase rages. 

            MOVING WITH GRACE

            as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of
            chicken wire. His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free...

            MOVING WITH BUD

            at a searing pace. He slips in the mud. Staggers up. SEES
            Grace disappear in the shadows.

            Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit. Eyes
            darting. Wheezing hard... Tries to slow his breath. Then
            turns the corner...

            GRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!!

            The blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground,
            with a blood-covered broken face. As he tries to get up...

            Bud's gun is there. And like that, it stops.

            INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - AFTER HOURS

            At a table, the METRO SQUAD: Bud, Shepard, Marandino, Cobb
            are drinking. A bartender (SHERRY) is wiping down glasses...

                                COBB
                      Think I broke a knuckle on that guy's
                      tooth.

                                SHEPARD
                      He only had one tooth.

                                COBB
                      Well I got it, didn't I?

                                MARANDINO
                          (to the bartender)
                      Another round, Sherry.

                                SHERRY
                      Comin' up.

            Bud blows smoke, distant from the others.

                                MARANDINO
                      Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'.
                      'Been workin' this case for months. And
                      you ain't said shit.

                                BUD
                      They had a lot of weight. Too much.

                                COBB
                      It's a ring. Organized burglary. 

                                BUD
                      You saw them guys. You think that half
                      ass crew was organized?

                                MARANDINO
                          (laughs)
                      They shit their pants in unison.

                                COBB
                      What are you gettin' after, Bud?

                                SHEPARD
                      You think it was someone else's score. 

            Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on.

                                BUD
                      I think its a part of somethin' bigger.

            Bud takes his shot.

                                BUD
                      Tomorrow morning we put our friends under
                      the lamp. If they know this "someone
                      else", we'll know him too.

            EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - ESTABLISH - NEXT DAY

            A dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway.

            INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY

            Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're
            looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM,
            where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler.

                                RAY
                      I told you... I keep tellin' you... I
                      don't know nothin'. That's it.

                                COBB
                      That's not it. We've been here all
                      morning. We'll stay here all night.

            Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino
            is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose).

                                MARANDINO
                      The stones you were fencin' belonged to
                      an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers".
                      The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both
                      owners can verify their belongings, and
                      have. 
                          (beat)
                      Who you fencin' for?

                                GRACE
                      Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit.

                                MARANDINO
                      Then your name's on a dozen other jobs,
                      just like it.

                                GRACE
                      That's bullshit.

                                MARANDINO
                      No, that's a promise.

            Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview...

                                COBB
                      We got a series of burglaries in the
                      area. All over the last six months. All
                      still open. You don't talk, it's on you.

                                RAY
                      Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that.

                                COBB
                      Any idea who does?

                                RAY
                      No! Okay? Fuck no.

            Bud sets down his coffee, calm.

            INT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM

            Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated.

                                MARANDINO
                      ...Answer the question.

                                GRACE
                          (exploding)
                      MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S
                      JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS!

            The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against
            the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down.

                                BUD
                      Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb
                      to be any more than a courier. I know
                      you're coverin' for someone else. NOW
                      TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS!

                                GRACE
                      I ain't a rat!

                                BUD
                      YOU AIN'T A RAT?!

            Bud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS.

                                MARANDINO
                      Easy, Bud. Go easy.

                                GRACE
                          (to Marandino)
                      STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM!

            Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off.

                                BUD
                      LOCK THE DOOR!

            Marandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder,
            nearly rips it off his face.

                                BUD
                      I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll
                      throw you in an eight by nine and have
                      you fucked in the ass by every inmate in
                      the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE
                      REST OF YOUR LIFE!

            Grace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks.

                                BUD
                      GIVE ME A NAME!

                                GRACE
                          (hacking)
                      He's from Whiskey Bay--!

                                BUD
                      --GIVE ME A NAME!!

            EXT. CLAYTON STREET - NIGHT

            Raining.

            An unmarked chevy is staked down the block from a tract home.

                                BUD V.O.
                      Jesse Wheeler. Thirty-one.

            INT. CHEVY - NIGHT

            Bud's in the front seat, looking through a file. Shepard at
            the wheel. Coffee cups and junk food litter the dash.

                                BUD
                      Two tours in 'Nam. '69 and '71. He's a
                      jump marine. Weapons trained, explosives.
                          (turns the page)
                      Seven and a half out of a twelve year
                      stint for federal robbery. Two in Angola.
                      A year in DeQuincy. Three in El Reno with
                      a transfer to Lewisburg. Then Marion with
                      a brief stopover in Leavenworth. Released
                      from Oxford, 1981.

                                SHEPARD
                      Jacket's the size of the bible.

            Through the windshield, across the street, a tract home
            they're watching.

                                BUD
                      His stay at Marion, they kept him in "H"
                      block.

                                SHEPARD
                      H block? That's home to forty top murder
                      one inmates...

                                BUD
                      Yeah, life sentences. Jesse only had
                      twelve years.

            Bud likes it.

                                BUD
                      He ain't just woodwork.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
            Night passes and the dawn arrives...

            EXT. WHEELER'S HOUSE - DAWN

            Front door opens and the shadowy figure of JESSE WHEELER,
            whose face we cannot see, emerges.

                                SHEPARD
                          (waking Bud)
                      Target's out.

            Jesse fires up his '74 battered green PICK-UP TRUCK. He backs
            from the driveway and proceeds down the street.

                                BUD
                          (into radio)
                      Alright. Give him room.

            Bud's car starts and we move off with them...

                                BUD
                          (into radio)
                      We're mobile.

            EXT. STREETS - MINUTES LATER

            In the rain, Bud and Shepard tail Jesse from a distance.

            They pass an alley where a waiting BUICK falls in behind the
            Chevy; Marandino and Cobb are inside.

            INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:

            We see the truck slowing, angling into a TEXACO STATION.

                                SHEPARD
                      He's turnin' off.

                                BUD
                      Let's take him in the car.
                          (into radio)
                      Wait'll he's stopped. Watch your
                      backgrounds.

            INT. JESSE'S PICK UP - MOMENTS LATER

            Jesse stops at a pump. Suddenly, Bud appears at the window
            and jams a SHOTGUN against Jesse's head.

                                BUD
                      Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow
                      your head clean off.

            Reflecting in the side-view: Bud's BADGE swings from his
            neck. Jesse's eyes resign to relief. Bud SEES this...

                                BUD
                      Shut the car off slowly.

            With several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from
            all directions, Jesse turns off his engine.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE - MORNING

            Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in
            unison around the house.

            Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard...

            Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays
            quietly inside. No one in the windows. 

            Shepard signals to Marandino...

            INT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE

            THE FRONT DOOR IS KICKED DOWN. Shepard and Marandino spill
            in, guns ready...

                                SHEPARD
                      POLICE! WARRANT!

            A pregnant woman in the kitchen... LYNN WHEELER, 30s. She
            SCREAMS, curses. Hurling dirty dishes fly like frisbees. 

                                LYNN
                      GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!

                                MARANDINO
                      MA'AM, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!

                                SHEPARD
                      WE GOT A WARRANT!

                                LYNN
                          (more dishes)
                      FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

            Lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly, sinks to the floor. A GUSH OF
            FLUID soaks through her dress. 

                                LYNN
                      Help... My baby...my baby...

            Bud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn. Bud
            lowers Lynn to the floor.

                                BUD
                          (to Cobb)
                      CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW!

            BEDROOM - TIME CUT

            A door slams open to reveal...

            A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG. Draped across the far wall.
            Windows taped over. Walls painted black.

            Military surplus on every shelf and surface. Helmets.
            Uniforms. Body armor. Bayonets.

            Bud in the doorway. Shepard joins him.

                                BUD
                      Toss everything.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

            Several COPS(now on scene) ransack the house. Ripping open
            cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor...

            GARAGE

            Cobb flips a switch. A lamp illuminates a workbench.

                                COBB
                      Alright, I want everything seized!

            Cabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open. Cops stop cold,
            blown away by what they see: GUNS. Everywhere.

            LIVING ROOM

            COP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25
            below a chair cushion.

            BATHROOM

            COP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he
            removes a dripping .357.

            KITCHEN

            Several STATE TROOPERS lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table.

            ATTIC

            Floor peels back. Flashlights illuminate: AMMUNITION BOXES.
            ASSAULT RIFLES. GRENADES. BONDS and COUNTERFEIT PLATES.

                                MARANDINO
                      Motherfucker's got a general store.

            LIVING ROOM

            Cops talk excitedly over one another. Shepard leans over a
            mounted A.C. He finds a string and very slowly pulls up a
            ziploc bag filled with DIAMONDS.

                                SHEPARD
                      God damn...there's some weight.

            KITCHEN

            Bud takes a seat at the table...

            For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold
            eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a
            boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS.

                                BUD
                      I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of
                      the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct.
                          (smiles)
                      So how you like Baton Rouge?

            Jesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly.

            Cabinets slam open and closed. Dishes hit the floor.

                                JESSE
                      What happened to my wife?

                                BUD
                      Water broke. She's en route to the
                      hospital.

            COP #3 is searching the refrigerator. Jesse watches as if
            he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on...

            Jesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own...

            Bud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From
            inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS.

                                BUD
                      This is new.

            Bud examines a vial's label: "CYANIDE."

                                BUD
                      What's the cyanide for, Jesse?

                                JESSE
                      Extracting impurities.

            Bud, right with him, grins.

                                BUD
                      Impurities from what?

            Jesse, calm. Deadpan.

                                BUD
                      You're in a bad situation here, pal.

                                JESSE
                      I'll make bond.

            Bud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it.

            BEDROOM

            Shepard, searching the room. Drawers, cabinets. Then leans
            down to peer under the bed... 

            ...stops, stunned when he SEES: a row of live Goex charges in
            packing, boldly marked: EXPLOSIVES

                                SHEPARD
                          (top of his lungs)
                      OUT! EVERYONE OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            MIKE BRADDOCK (40s), Captain of Detectives, enters his
            office. Bud tows, carrying files.

                                BRADDOCK
                      What more do you want? You got a two time
                      felon on multiple counts. You got
                      robbery, B&E, you got an all-you-can-eat
                      felony fuckin' possession. All on top of
                      an organized burglary ring.

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. PROCESSING ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            ON A CAMERA FLASH. Mug shots of Jesse's front and profile.

                                BRADDOCK V.O.
                      The man's in custody, Bud. Fucked for
                      life. It's finished.

            Jesse's inked fingers are rolled onto an exemplar sheet.

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

                                BUD
                      There's more, I know it.

            Bud slaps a file on Braddock's desk, to a crime scene photo:
            An Asian JUDGE sits dead in the front seat of his car.

                                BUD
                      Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge
                      gets popped with a .357. Well I got a
                      Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it
                      through ballistics.

                                BRADDOCK
                      And?

                                BUD
                      It's a solid match! Dead on. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      There's a dozen ways Wheeler could've got
                      that burner. It don't prove a thing. 

                                BUD
                          (drops another file)
                      A stack of bonds taken from the home of a
                      Baptist Minister... 

            The crime photo: A black MINISTER and wife shot in bed.

                                BUD
                      Murdered. He and his wife. Looked like a
                      robbery gone to shit then; I want it
                      opened back up.

            INT. ANTE ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            A nude Jesse steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam.

                                BUD V.O.
                      I still got tests pending. More guns.
                      More cases. This guy ain't crazy, Mike.
                      He's a ticket to somethin' big. Somethin'
                      happening now.

            INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            Meanwhile...

                                BRADDOCK
                      So who's backin' him?

                                BUD
                      I don't know; I do know they'll post his
                      bond. That's why I need a price they
                      can't come up with overnight.

            Braddock listens. Bud keeps it on track...

                                BUD
                      I'm right about this, Mike.
                          (leans close)
                      When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years
                      and he ain't upset... It's like when your
                      wife is accusing you of fuckin' the
                      neighbor, but she don't know you're
                      fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty
                      calm about it, right?

            Braddock smiles slightly.

                                BUD
                      It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The
                      guns, the other shit, the time... He can
                      have that conversation. And he is. And he
                      ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact,
                      'cause we're fallin' short.
                          (the bottom line)
                      This guy knows things. He knows where
                      bodies are.

            Braddock, thinks; Then--

                                BRADDOCK
                      I'll bounce it up to the D.A.

            Bud grins, SLAMS his hand on the desk.

            INT. HOLDING AREA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

            Two GUARDS escort Jesse. He's bound in chains, orange scrubs. 

            INT. HOLDING CELL

            End of the hall. A BLACK PRISONER waits, arms slung over the
            crossbars with a cigarette. Jesse is brought forth.

            A Guard unlocks the cell. The Black Prisoner steps back,
            joining TWO OTHERS: All black, looming in the darkness.

            Jesse steps in. Guards unlock his shackles. Chains hit the
            floor. Behind him, the bars slam home.

            SILENCE...LONG, DRAWN SILENCE. THEN:

                                JESSE
                      My name is Jesse Wheeler... I'm now in
                      charge of this cell. Any y'all don't like
                      it, step your black ass forward, line up.

            A MOMENT. Cued by Jesse's challenge, each of the prisoners
            slowly rise, vehemently approaching...

                                                          CUT ABRUPT TO:

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

            And the phone RINGS...

                                BUD
                          (answers)
                      Yeah... 

                                MALE VOICE (OVER)
                      Bud? Charlie Bowers.

            WIDEN. Bud's house is sparsely furnished. Books on firearms
            and police work in stacks. As he reaches for a file...

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      Charlie... You had an inmate in '75,
                      named Jesse Wheeler.

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. OFFICE, MARION PENITENTIARY, ILLINOIS - NIGHT

            CHARLIE BOWERS, on an official phone. At Jesse's name, he's
            DEAD QUIET...

                                BUD
                      Charlie, you there?

                                CHARLIE
                      What's your interest in this guy, Bud?

                                BUD
                      Well, we got him on weapons and burglary.
                      But I got a feelin' there's more.

                                CHARLIE
                      Damn straight, a lot more. Race riots.
                      Smuggling. Extorting a guard. I had a few
                      run-ins with him myself.

                                BUD
                      What else?

            INT. BEDROOM, BUD'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Bud lies in bed, wide awake. The PHONE CONVERSATION carries
            over...

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      You could say this is where he peaked.

            KITCHEN - DAWN

            Coffee pours into a mug. Then a shot of Irish Whiskey.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      He's a white supremacist. The worst kind,
                      if there is one.

            Bud, dressed now. The table is covered with various reports
            and photos from Jesse's file. BUD'S EYES guide us through...

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      Came in on armed robbery and assault...

            Bud picks up a photo: Jesse's Angola mug shot, age 23.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      But word in the system said, he's a
                      contract killer for the Aryan
                      Brotherhood.

            Photos of Jesse's tattoos: SUN-WHEEL on the shoulder; HELL
            HOUNDS around the biceps, THOR'S ELAPID covering his back.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      In here, the guy became an organizer...

            INT. BUD'S CAR, TRAVELING - MORNING

            Bud's face goes in and out of light and shadow.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      Controlling hits and movements inside the
                      system. Prison to prison. State to state.

            INT. LOWER FLOOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - MORNING

            Bud is walking with MURPHY, captain of the guards...

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo
                      Nazis, he unified the front...

            Bud and Murphy descend steps to a grim CORRIDOR.

                                CHARLIE V.O.
                      All them prison gangs in the world...
                      Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it.
                      The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse
                      Wheeler was their ring leader.

            The PHONE CONVERSATION fades out... Presently:

                                BUD
                      So what the fuck happened?

                                MURPHY
                      Processing ain't open till morning. We
                      threw him in holding last night. 'Fore we
                      even turn around, it's like we're back in
                      the fuckin' Alamo.

                                BUD
                      He attack the guards?

                                MURPHY
                      Guards are fine. But he took on three
                      niggers like they stole from him.

            Murphy stops outside a solid steel door.

                                MURPHY
                      I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it
                      happened, our block was the quietest it'd
                      ever been. Wish we had ten just like him.

                                BUD
                      Open the door.

            INT. ISOLATION CELL - CONTINUOUS

            Bud enters. Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks BOLT.
            We're in a stone closet. No bed or sink. No light.

                                BUD
                      Heard you refused a public defender.

            Jesse's bruised face moves through shadow.

                                BUD
                      At the gas station...When you were
                      arrested, I put a gun to your head.   
                      You expected someone else.

                                JESSE
                      You don't look like cops.

                                BUD
                      And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells
                      me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the
                      fridge, explosives...tells me you're
                      scared.

            Jesse's eyes emerge from the dark. Bud, looking right at him.

                                BUD
                      I know who you are.

                                JESSE
                      If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in
                      here alone.

            Bud smiles and walks to the door.

                                BUD
                      One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this
                      morning.
                          (grins)
                      There is no bond.

            HOLD on Jesse.

            Bud BANGS on the door. Locks UNLATCH. The door opens and Bud
            steps calmly out to the hall...

            The door shuts with a BOOM, locking Jesse in. And the nail in
            the coffin resonates.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

            Dim and desolate.

            INT. LOBBY, GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

            Grace buys a ticket, crosses the lobby to the men's room.

            INT. MEN'S ROOM

            Grace at the sink. He pats running water on his damaged face
            and straightens the bandage. 

            A TOILET FLUSHES

            the stall door opens and a man emerges. Lean and fierce, like
            an electric charge... CATFISH STANTON, 30.

            Grace FREEZES at the sight of Catfish, tightening his belt.
            Lets the water run...

                                CATFISH
                      Grace? That you?

                                GRACE
                      Hey there, Catfish...

            Catfish steps close, reaches a hand to Grace's face.

                                CATFISH
                      'The hell happened?

            Grace flinches. Catfish pauses, then SNIFFS his hand.

                                CATFISH
                          (smiles)
                      Oh... Excuse me.

            Catfish steps to the sink. Begins washing his hands.

                                CATFISH
                      So where you off to?

                                GRACE
                      Goin' to visit my mother. She's real
                      sick.

                                CATFISH
                      That's too bad. So you'll be gone a long
                      time then.

                                GRACE
                      Yeah...

            Another MAN suddenly enters. Large and imposing, neck tattoos
            ...BUZZ MCKINNON, 32.

                                GRACE
                          (swallows hard)
                      Buzz.

            Catfish turns off the water. THE BATHROOM IS SUFFOCATED WITH
            SILENCE.

                                GRACE
                      What can I do y'all for?

                                CATFISH
                      How come the Wheeler brothers, is locked
                      up? And you ain't?

                                GRACE
                      Wheeler brothers is locked up? I don't
                      know nothin' about that. 

            Catfish GRINS. It's harsh. Blood curdling.

                                CATFISH
                      I heard different.

                                GRACE
                      Well there ain't no "different" to hear,
                      Catfish. 'Cause I ain't talked to neither
                      of 'em.

                                CATFISH
                      But you did talk to someone.

            Buzz moves. Grace turns to look...

            ...In a blink, Catfish's gun comes up: ONE QUICK POP. A .45
            with a thick, barrel silencer. The mirror shatters. Grace's
            knees hit the floor. His head hits the sink, HOLDS. As blood
            runs from one small hole.

            Catfish straightens up in the next mirror. Tucks his shirt.
            Grace's body sags to the floor. Catfish and Buzz walk out.

            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            LOUD BUZZER. Two GUARDS #1 and #2 march Jesse down the tier.
            On his left, PRISONERS in cells, TURN, STARE and WHISPER. 

            Jesse arrives at a cell.

                                GUARD #1
                          (calls out)
                      Open ninety-six!

            BARS slide back. Jesse walks in. His CELL-MATE steps
            cautiously from the shadows... 

            IT'S RAY. Pale and nervous. Jesse stands over him. The
            brothers' eyes connect. And there's a moment...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. EXERCISE YARD, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard
            towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS.

            Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press.
            He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.

                                RAY O.S.
                      This place is bad...

            Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as
            he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder... 

                                RAY
                      There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a
                      sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I
                      talked.

            Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.

                                RAY
                      Just the other day... some spic fish got
                      hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they
                      beat him and stabbed him till there
                      weren't nothin' left. And the guards let
                      it happen.

            Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.

                                RAY
                      His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like
                      somebody painted 'em.

            Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.

                                JESSE
                      They come at you?

                                RAY
                      Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can
                      feel it fuckin' coming.

            Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the
            yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp
            looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back.

            The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained
            face as the bar lands with a CRASH.

            INT. YARD CORRIDOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY,
            LATER 

            A long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate.
            Ray, behind Jesse. Says low:

                                RAY
                      Hey, Jesse... 
                          (silence)
                      Sorry I put you back here. I never meant--

                                JESSE
                          (turns)
                      "Sorry", Raymond...? You ain't sorry.
                          (pause)
                      I took you into my home. I tried to clean
                      you up. And you steal from me...? You
                      take my fuckin' diamonds? 
                          (dead to rights)
                      'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my
                      son. 

            Ray swallows hard. Nothing he can say.

            INT. METRO OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            CLOSE ON numerous files of ARYAN GANG MEMBERS. Arrest sheets,
            paperwork and photos.

                                BUD O.S.
                      Alright, let's work this...
                          (beat)
                      In prison, Wheeler is credited for the
                      expansion of the Brotherhood. When
                      Federal split up members, they had to
                      reorganize. So they tattooed their blood
                      types and serial numbers on one another.

                                COBB O.S.
                      Recede and multiply.

                                BUD O.S.
                      Exactly...

            REVEAL NOW Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a
            table, used as a converted eating area. 

                                BUD
                      Put 'em in prison, they get stronger.
                      Everywhere you send one, they recruit in
                      numbers. Within five years, their numbers
                      were over ten thousand.

                                MARANDINO
                      Wheeler directed all that, huh?

            Shepard is flipping through a worn, thick file.

                                BUD
                      What do you got there, Shep'?

                                SHEPARD
                      Interpol wired us files on three known
                      Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana:
                      Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this
                      man... Lucian Adams.

            He opens the file, revealing mugshots of LUCIAN ADAMS, 51.
            Dark eyes. Sharp, gun metal features. 

                                SHEPARD
                      High priest of the Aryan National Party.
                      His "ministry" of Christian Identity and
                      Paramilitary Order has stood for over a
                      decade. Check this out...

            Shepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot)
            Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound.

                                SHEPARD
                      Wheeler was just seventeen when he met
                      Lucian at the Patriotic Congress.

                                MARANDINO
                      No shit.

                                SHEPARD
                      Today, Lucian's one hell of an
                      entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores.
                      Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks
                      runnin' all across the God damn country.

            Bud's been quiet; says now:

                                BUD
                      Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I
                      need an angle.

                                COBB
                      For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news
                      would spread like wildfire. The AB's
                      gonna know about it. They'd gonna know
                      about it nationally.
                          (re: his coffee)
                      Pass the sugar.

            Marandino does.

                                BUD
                      That's if he was a surface informant. I
                      don't want him to testify. I want to keep
                      him on the street.
                          (to the group)
                      Look, this guy's been in it a long time.
                      He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his
                      hands free. I can feel it.

                                MARANDINO
                      Braddock ain't gonna go for this.

                                BUD
                      I'll handle that.

            Everyone looks to Bud.

                                BUD
                      We got one chance here. 'Cause if this
                      falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more
                      dead than alive.

            INT. CAFETERIA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - EVENING

            A sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see.  

            Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN
            PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit.

            Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly
            sit across from the Wheeler brothers.

                                CZAPP
                      How you doin', Ray?
                          (off Ray's look)
                      We was just over there wonderin' why you
                      ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to
                      your kin.

                                RAY
                      I was gonna.

                                CZAPP
                          (grins)
                      I'm sure you was.

            Czapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up.

                                CZAPP
                      Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you...

                                ROACH
                      Fuckin-A, heard a lot.

                                CZAPP
                      Name's Czapp... You can call me,
                      "Bossman."
                          (beat)
                      I kept an eye on your brother the past
                      few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray?

                                RAY
                          (low)
                      Yeah...

                                JESSE
                      My brother ain't none of your business.

                                CZAPP
                      Ain't none of my business, "Bossman." And
                      everything in this fuckin' place is my
                      business.

            Ray nervously glances down at several Aryans watching...

                                CZAPP
                          (to Jesse)
                      Listen to me, you sonofabitch. I'm gonna
                      make one God damn thing God damn clear.
                      Your reputation is smoke. Whatever they
                      say you is or once was, I don't give a
                      flyin' fuck. 'Cause it's my say-so now.
                      And your fuckin' brother's up for grabs.

            Czapp looks away from Jesse and shouts down the table:

                                CZAPP
                      Y'all got that?!

            Suddenly Jesse SPRINGS. A headbutt EXPLODES Czapp's nose and
            throws him back.

            Czapp's head hits linoleum, echoing with a CRACK!! He lies
            still. Bloodied and unconscious.

                                ROACH
                          (stumbles away, shocked)
                      Fuck...

            A DEAFENING SILENCE SPREADS OVER THE CAFETERIA.

            Jesse calmly resumes eating. Czapp's blood covers his face.

            SUDDENLY AN ALARM BLARES. GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy.

            INMATES HIT THE DECK, arms behind their heads. All except
            Jesse, who continues to eat.

                                MURPHY
                      WHEELER!!! Stand the fuck up! Hands
                      behind your head! 

            Jesse rises.

                                MURPHY
                      Hands behind your head! Get on the
                      fuckin' floor!

            Jesse puts his hands behind his head, but does not kneel.

            Restraints are slammed on Jesse's wrists. And we...

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

            INT. ISOLATION, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATE NIGHT

            The door unlocks and drags open. Jesse turns, blinking
            painfully into the light ...Sees an imposing DUTY GUARD.

                                DUTY GUARD
                      Phone call.

            INT. GUARD STATION

            Jesse is led in. Duty Guard hits an extension button on a
            desk phone and offers the receiver...

            Jesse doesn't move.

                                DUTY GUARD
                      It's a secure line.

            Duty Guard walks out. Alone now, Jesse picks up the line...

                                JESSE
                          (into phone)
                      Yeah.

            A low, whiskey voice is HEARD over the line: LUCIAN ADAMS.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      Been a long time...

            Jesse shuts his eyes. There's a moment before he opens them.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      Read about the arrest, Jesse. There's a
                      lot of heat on this one.

                                JESSE
                      I don't want my brother touched.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                          (laughs faintly)
                      I ain't callin' about your brother. I'm
                      callin' about you...

            Jesse turns SLOW to find the Duty Guard watching him from the
            hall. Lights a cigarette, stares.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      You should have come to me sooner, Jesse.
                      None of this would have happened.

                                JESSE
                      I'm askin' you, Lucian. My brother ain't
                      a problem.

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      Your brother's a fuck up.

            And Jesse's quiet... Dead quiet...

                                LUCIAN V.O.
                      And Jesse... We may know what you can do.
                      But you know what we can do. Understand?

            Jesse hesitates, then Lucian hangs up. DIAL TONE.

            INT. BRADDOCK'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

            Room strewn with piles of casework. Bud, agitated, paces.
            Braddock, behind a desk. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      You're reachin', Bud. The leverage ain't
                      there.

                                BUD
                      It's there. It's gotta cook a little
                      longer, that's all.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Jesse won't so much as blink at doin'
                      life. The fuckin' guy didn't rise in the
                      ranks 'cause he skirts under pressure.
                          (beat)
                      There's no deal to be had.

                                BUD
                      C'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on.
                      Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse. By that,
                      he compromised the Brotherhood. Don't
                      tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage.

            Bud pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                BRADDOCK
                      We need somethin' more.

                                BUD
                      Well we ain't sleepin' till we find it.

            INT. VISITOR'S GATE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, goes through security
            check. INFANT SON in her arms.

            VISITING AREA

            Wives, girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners.

            TABLE

            Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, holding their son, across
            from Jesse...

                                LYNN
                      Life. You know how fuckin' long that is,
                      Jesse?

            Lynn's hands are shaking.

                                LYNN
                      So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run?
                          (upset)
                      Your friends are comin' by the house.
                      Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin'
                      for the God damn phone to ring.

            Jesse is silent.

                                LYNN
                      You said we were done with this. That
                      they were out of our lives.

            The baby begins to CRY.

                                LYNN
                      We have no money, Jesse. Which means we
                      have no fucking food. ...Say something,
                      would you?

                                JESSE
                      It's gonna be okay.

                                LYNN
                      I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life...

            The baby WAILING now.

                                LYNN
                          (quietly crying)
                      ...For our baby.

            TIGHT ON JESSE, for the first time, appearing powerless.

            As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away
            from his son, and glances up...

            Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching
            them...

            BUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare.

            INT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER

            A CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She
            wipes her eyes, holding the baby.

            The back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled
            clothes.

                                BUD
                      Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly
                      introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter.

                                LYNN
                      I know who you are.

                                BUD
                      You have a ride home?

                                LYNN
                      We took the bus.

            Bud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter.

                                BUD
                      Take a cab.

            Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn.

                                BUD
                      'You need anything...anything at all. Be
                      sure to call me.

            They look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an
            unspoken moment. And Bud walks away... 

            Lynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And
            the card.

            INT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

            A Guard buzzes Jesse through.

            PRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out.
            Jesse walks past, enters...

            HIS CELL

            ...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk.

            Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He
            gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray...

                                JESSE
                      Ray...

            No response. Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder. 

                                JESSE
                      Raymond, take a look.

            Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded
            his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant.

            THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR...

            Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes.
            Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive
            frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying... 

                                                               TIME CUT:

            EXT. LOADING DOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

            Pouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance.

            INT. JESSE'S CELL - DUSK

            Jesse sits in shadow. Alone. And it's still...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            AFTER HOURS

            Jesse sleeps. Hand under the pillow. When there's a sound...

            His eyes SNAP OPEN to discover the silhouettes of SIX MEN,
            rushing into his cell...

            A LOADED SOCK swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams MAN #1 in
            the jaw with a CRACK!!

            On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks MAN #2's
            head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious.

            A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot
            bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out.

            With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes
            MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

            The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down
            and Jesse sinks into their grip.

            HALL LIGHTS BUMP ON: NOW WE SEE, THESE "MEN" ARE GUARDS.

            More GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. They yank Jesse from his
            cell and take him down the tier.

            Guards toss the cell in a thorough search. Mattress
            overturns. Shelves crash.

            INT. TIER

            PRISONERS move to their bars, SHOUTING and JEERING as Jesse
            is wrestled down the STAIRS to...

            THE LOWER TIER

            Jesse thrashes violently as the Guards slam him through a
            door into...

            A TUNNEL

            between cell blocks. The ROAR of prisoners recedes as Jesse's
            dragged into darkness getting darker.

            A DOOR SLAMS OPEN...

            INT. READY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON

            ...THERE'S A FLASH OF LIGHT. We're in a windowless room.

            And Bud pouring coffee for two...

                                BUD
                      Want a cup of coffee?

            Jesse is handcuffed to the table. Guards are breathing hard.

                                JESSE
                      MOTHERFUCKER! This how you do things?

                                BUD
                      Yeah... When I want to talk to someone,
                      without giving the impression he's
                      cooperatin'.

            Jesse pauses, caught by Bud's tactics. The Guards file out
            and shut the door.

            Jesse's eyes are fierce and watching Bud's every movement as
            he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat...

                                BUD
                      You got a problem.

                                JESSE
                      Yeah, what's that?

                                BUD
                      To start with, you're lookin' at two
                      hundred years.

                                JESSE
                      I've done the time. I'll do it again.

                                BUD
                      I know you can do it. But can your
                      family?

            Jesse's face is tense. Unyielding.

                                BUD
                      Your brother's dead, Jesse. As we're
                      sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St.
                      Gabriel's Morgue. The coroner's callin'
                      it, "suicide". You and I both know that's
                      a load of shit.
                          (beat)
                      You do the time-- sure. And you never see
                      your kid. 'Cept in here. You can recruit
                      him. Your wife...plans...everything...
                      Gone.
                          (beat)
                      'Less you talk...to me.

            Jesse silent, a dark internal pause. He meets Bud's eyes
            across the table; then...

                                JESSE
                      Do you hate?

                                BUD
                      What?

            Jesse's sudden directness has caught Bud off-guard.

                                JESSE
                      Who do you hate the most? Blacks you
                      throw in prison?

                                BUD
                      ...I dislike what they represent in the
                      system. Not as a whole.

            And Jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach."

                                JESSE
                      And you believe that by overthrowin'
                      Aryan nationalism and integratin'
                      races...polluted creeds, with us...You
                      believe you're solvin' somethin'?

                                BUD
                      I believe we survive by integrating
                      safety. Understanding hate, and how to
                      stop it.

                                JESSE
                      It ain't evil to fight it. It's evil to
                      tolerate it.
                          (leans in)
                      Maybe you forget that, to justify what
                      you do for a living...

                                BUD
                      Are we still in prison, or we back at the
                      compound, havin' mass?

                                JESSE
                      You don't get it.

                                BUD
                      No, don't dictate to me what put you in
                      here, or question my intentions with your
                      overcooked revolution!
                          (beat)
                      'Fact, I think you wanted out 'fore I
                      even got to you! That's why you distanced
                      yourself. That's why you're out there
                      crackin' safes. Lookin' to live a life
                      that ain't AB.

                                JESSE
                      In who I am, there's pressure! I work for
                      you, I won't need a lawyer, I'll need a
                      priest! My outside finance is gone... My
                      wife and son, their heads wind up
                      somewhere their bodies ain't! So tell me,
                      why the fuck should I get involved with
                      you?!

                                BUD
                      How about personal warranty?

                                JESSE
                      Warranty?!

                                BUD
                      Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of
                      the problem so long, you've forgotten
                      what the fuck that is!
                          (boaring in)
                      "Finance..." Your wife came here on a bus
                      to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is
                      that your outside fuckin' finance?!

            Beat. Jesse, taken back.

                                BUD
                      Let me give you a little insight, pal. As
                      to what I know... And what you think you
                      know.

            Bud flips open a file and shoves a series of grainy B&W
            SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS in front of Jesse.

                                BUD
                      This is today...

            Photo #1: Outside Jesse's House. A distressed Lynn and the
            baby being led into a car by Catfish.  

                                BUD
                      Is that your house? That's your wife,
                      right? Who's this guy?

            Photo #2: Tight-shot of Catfish.

                                BUD
                          (off Jesse's look)
                      Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your
                      family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.

            Photo #3: An anonymous duplex. Catfish escorting Lynn and the
            baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on.

            Jesse finally averts his eyes... 

                                BUD
                      Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her
                      face. And your son. They look safe to
                      you?  
                          (a moment)
                      I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's
                      got! And the longer you're in here,
                      they're up for grabs.  

            ON JESSE. The wheels turning. Burning. THE CAMERA MOVES IN...

                                BUD
                      So either you let that happen... Or I get
                      the judge to allow bond. This never sees
                      trial. And you work for me. 

            And that's where it hangs...

                                                                  BLACK.

                                JUDGE V.O.
                      Jesse Wheeler. Please rise...

            FADE IN:

            INT. COURTROOM, BATON ROUGE - DAY

            Jesse rises, wearing a suit. JUDGE PONDER, at the bench,
            presides over this arraignment hearing:

                                JUDGE PONDER
                      You stand accused of forty counts of
                      burglary, twenty nine counts of felony
                      theft, possession of illegal firearms,
                      possession or dealing in unregistered
                      weapons, possession of a controlled
                      substance, manufacture and possession of
                      incendiary devices, and seventeen counts
                      of receiving stolen goods... How do you
                      plead?

            CUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively
            dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising:

                                KIERSEY
                      Not guilty, Your Honor.

                                JUDGE PONDER
                      Let's hear the arguments for bail.

            The DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat:

                                DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                      Your honor, this man is an habitual felon
                      as well as a flight risk. Our office has
                      overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is
                      not only guilty, but also a serious
                      threat to the community. The State
                      recommends that bail be denied.

                                KIERSEY
                      Your honor, my client deserves a
                      reasonable bail. He has every intention
                      of appearing and answering to all these
                      false charges. In addition, he is the
                      sole provider for his wife and newborn
                      child, who would suffer undo hardship if
                      this man were incarcerated.

            CUT TO Judge Ponder:

                                JUDGE PONDER
                      Bond is set at one million.

            THE GAVEL BANGS DOWN. Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand. Smiles:

                                KIERSEY
                      Congratulations.

            REVEAL BUD -- seated in back, watching the proceedings.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. BEDROOM, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Lynn, asleep in bed... 

            INT. HALLWAY

            Jesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him. When
            Jesse turns, WE SEE a .45 tucked in his back.

            AND THE PHONE RINGS...

                                JESSE
                          (answers)
                      Yeah...

            STATIC; he listens, then:

                                JESSE
                          (into phone)
                      Okay.

            EXT. BACKYARD, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR
            waiting idyll on a dirt road. 

            INT. CAR - PRE DAWN

            A HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights
            spin on and the car pulls away... 

            EXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN

            Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out
            and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.

            On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm
            Mississippi. His back is to us. 

            Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him.

                                MAN'S VOICE
                      How's your family?

            We realize now...It's Bud.

                                JESSE
                      Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't
                      here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I
                      did, 'cause certain people crossed the
                      line. They didn't keep their word.

                                BUD
                      Well my word counts.

            They stand together, facing the liquid horizon...  

                                BUD
                      I want a body, Jesse.

                                JESSE
                      How many you want?

            Bud finally looks at Jesse.

            EXT. BORROW PITS - DAWN 

            A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.
            Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.

            Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-
            LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.

            The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.
            Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.

            SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.

                                COBB
                      'The fuck is that?

            Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp.

                                BUD
                      Yard dog. Relax.

                                SHEPARD
                      Where's this motherfucker taking us?

            Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.

                                JESSE
                          (directly to Bud)
                      Dig here.

            Metro exchanges looks, ANXIOUS. Bud nods "okay".

                                                                TIMECUT:

            EXT. JESSE'S BORROW PIT

            Metro engulfed in fog. Picks and shovels rise and fall.

                                MARANDINO
                      Bud! We hit something!

            Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal.

                                BUD
                      Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!

            Jesse watches as a pair of STEEL DRUMS emerge.

            INT. STATE POLICE AUTOPSY ROOM - MID MORNING

            The "cold room". Bud and Braddock watch as two PATHOLOGISTS
            hose down the drums. The stench is horrible.

                                BRADDOCK
                      How long they been down there?

                                BUD
                      Jesse tells me six months.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Six months? Bud, they're biodegraded by
                      now. Fuckin' worm food.

                                BUD
                      We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy
                      who put 'em there.

            BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums.

            Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And
            immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES.

            The room recoils from the fumes.

            INT. KITCHEN, JESSE'S HOUSE - DAY

            Lynn is putting dishes away. The baby nearby, sleeps quietly
            in a swing. Lynn gazes out the window...

            EXT. DRIVEWAY, JESSE'S HOUSE

            Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...
            When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street. 

            Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.  
            It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.

                                CATFISH
                      'Bout time to get a new truck there,
                      Jesse.

            Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.

                                CATFISH
                      Good to see you out. A free man now.

                                JESSE
                      What's goin' on, 'Fish?

                                CATFISH
                      On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good
                      Lord ridin' shotgun, through another
                      glorious Louisiana mornin'.

            Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach. 

                                CATFISH
                      Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you.
                      Fact, a lot of people are.  

            Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.

                                JESSE
                      You tell him I'll come by.

                                CATFISH
                          (no longer smiling)
                      That's good. I'll see you real soon then.

            As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being
            taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE.

            PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long
            lens camera, triggers snapshots. 

            INT. DINER - DAY

            Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons.

            Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with   
            MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney
            General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.

                                BUD
                      Hey, Mike.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch.
                      He's down from Washington. With the
                      Attorney General.

                                FITCH
                      Martin. Just call me Martin.

            Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case
                      for a Federal sponsor.

                                BUD
                      How long you been with the Attorney
                      General, Fitch?

                                FITCH
                      Just over a year.

            Bud looks at Braddock.

                                FITCH
                      I want to assure you my education and
                      experience is more than adequate to
                      handle a case of this potential.

                                BUD
                      Is that right...

            Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Why don't we get to the particulars?

                                FITCH
                      Right. Alright.
                          (clears throat)
                      To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need
                      something substantial. A bait. In the
                      Justice Department, we have this mission
                      statement... We decide who the target is,
                      what's the threat assessment, the cost
                      value, over what time table it's gonna
                      take place... Which target do we go after
                      first. We don't want to miss a big target
                      hitting a smaller target, you understand?

                                BUD
                      No.

                                FITCH
                      Well, exposing bodies has limitations.
                      Those people are dead. We can't retrieve
                      their lives.

            Bud blinks.

                                BRADDOCK
                      He means there might not be enough to
                      back Jesse.

                                BUD
                      Keep him on the street without
                      protection, he winds up dead.

                                FITCH
                      What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads.
                      He'll need to present something that
                      separates him from those we're going to
                      arrest. If Jesse can't offer something
                      continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of
                      much help.

            Bud stares at Fitch. 

            A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches. 

                                WAITRESS
                      Ready to order?

                                FITCH
                          (cuts in)
                      Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort
                      on the side.

                                WAITRESS
                      You'll take what?

                                FITCH
                          (curt)
                      It's a dressing. 

                                WAITRESS
                      Well...we got ranch, thousand island and
                      oil. Which one you want?

            Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch:

                                BUD
                      Lost my appetite.

            And walks out.

            EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY

            Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They
            say nothing till they reach the car.

                                BUD
                      I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds
                      want to help, that's fine. But not him.

                                BRADDOCK
                      What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's
                      not your partner, Bud. This case is
                      beyond our capacity. It requires
                      resources we don't have.

            Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.

                                BUD
                      They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They
                      send us some kid with a year under his
                      belt?! He don't even know what state he's
                      in... You want him in charge?!

                                BRADDOCK
                      You're God damn right I do! You're out on
                      a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job
                      to make sure you get back!

                                BUD
                      This is bullshit.

                                BRADDOCK
                      That may be. What it ain't, is open for
                      discussion.

            Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.

            INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING

            A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a
            stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.

                                JESSE
                      Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I
                      could tell y'all things. Names.
                      Locations. What boat is movin' what
                      drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get
                      cut up and why. ...But what I got to know
                      is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear
                      your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's
                      right by me and keep my head from gettin'
                      shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is,
                      you need me. You ain't got enough cops
                      with enough sense or enough time, to
                      clear them crimes that already been
                      committed and will be.
                          (pause)
                      Y'all need me... I got the devil's
                      address.

            REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.

            Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.
            Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the
            wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence.

            Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps
            forward, laughs nervously...

                                FITCH
                      Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse,
                      for that. And thank you, everyone for
                      attending...
                          (tight)
                      Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve
                      a matter of custody--

                                FBI #1
                      We'll protect you and your family, Jesse.
                          (to the room)
                      It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those
                      bodies were transported over state lines.

            An ATF AGENT #1 imposes:

                                ATF #1
                      Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This
                      man's house was a factory, for Christ's
                      sake. ATF is taking this.

                                DEA
                      Those murders were drug related. DEA's
                      got to do follow ups.

                                SECRET SERVICE
                      He was printing counterfeit money. 
                      That's Secret Service.

            ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch
            tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...

                                JESSE
                      There's a hit list.

            Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...

                                FITCH
                      Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone
                      quiet!

            And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:

                                FITCH
                      A what?

                                JESSE
                      A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might
                      be one or two less now, I ain't sure.
                      Some could've already been gotten.

                                BUD
                          (to Braddock)
                      Now we're talkin'.

            FBI #2 approaches Jesse...

                                FBI #2
                      Why these twelve, Jesse?

                                JESSE
                      Different reasons. It ain't so much why
                      or what they done that matters. Pick any
                      one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on
                      salary.

            Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.

                                JESSE
                      And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken...
                      You're Mr. Nokes, right?

            Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent 
            figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out...

                                JESSE
                      First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?

                                NOKES
                      That's right.

                                JESSE
                      Well, last time I seen it...you was
                      number two on that list.

            It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.

                                NOKES
                      Can you fill us in on the rest of those
                      names, Jesse?

                                JESSE
                      Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta
                      make clear 'fore that happens.

                                NOKES
                      What's that?

                                JESSE
                      I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've
                      listened to these suits here, on who's
                      gonna take me in...
                          (beat)
                      I will die, go to hell and take all y'all
                      cocksuckers with me, if he--
                          (motions to Bud)
                      --tells me to.
                          (beat)
                      I want y'all to know that.

            Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a
            CHILL falls over the room.

                                NOKES
                          (to Bud)
                      How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?

            Bud simply nods.

                                NOKES
                      I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will
                      come out of our budget. Anyone has
                      pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me.
                      I'll loan him out.

            Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a
            comfortable level...

                                NOKES
                      And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm
                      number two on that list. Who the fuck is
                      number one?

            The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            EXT. GRAND COUTEAU - DAY

            Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through
            sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area.

            EXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY

            Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates.

            A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second
            camera pans on Jesse, staring...

            MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. GUARD STATION - SAME

            A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits
            in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open.

            INT. JESSE'S TRUCK

            pulls down the private road.

            Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant
            VICTORIAN HOME. 

            Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing,
            shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol.

                                BUZZ
                      Jesse.

            Jesse nods, eyes Catfish.

                                JESSE
                      I'm here to see Lucian.

            Catfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet.

                                CATFISH
                      He's busy right now; You can come in and
                      wait.

            INT. LUCIAN ADAMS' OFFICE - DAY

            CLOSE ON: A SNIFTER

            as Louis XIII pours to the rim. From elsewhere in the room:

                                MALE VOICE
                      This operation of your's has become big
                      business. You need relationships now more
                      than ever...

            THE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a
            leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see. 

            Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey.

                                MORRIS
                      ...We've done business successfully
                      before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger
                      scope now. I'm here today because I want
                      to represent you exclusively. You need
                      someone lobbying at a state level, as
                      well as in Washington. My organization
                      can provide both. We've got contacts that
                      you don't have and other people can't
                      get. Now, I'm aware that you have
                      multiple businesses... However you need
                      one go-to guy, so that all your ventures
                      stay coordinated and all transactions and
                      contracts are realized. I am that person,
                      Mr. Adams. That's what I do.

            LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.

                                KIERSEY
                      What's this going to cost us?

                                MORRIS
                      As a retainer, I want an advance of three
                      hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten
                      percent of whatever economic benefit I
                      bring to this organization.

                                KIERSEY
                      Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of
                      line.

                                MORRIS
                      If you want a quality global economic
                      plan, that's what you pay for-- 

                                LUCIAN O.S.
                      We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's
                      what it's worth.

            Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.

                                LUCIAN O.S.
                      The advance is a drop in the bucket. The
                      real money is the percentage. It's in
                      your interest to see it my way.

            Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:

                                MORRIS
                      You've got a deal.

            INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY

            Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then
            shrugs on his coat and leaves... 

            Jesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in...

            INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE

            ...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable
            room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS.

            Jesse is not invited to sit.

                                LUCIAN
                          (to Kiersey)
                      Give us a minute.

            Kiersey walks out and shuts the door... 

            ON LUCIAN

            he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.

                                LUCIAN
                      You have a son now, right?

                                JESSE
                      Yeah...

            As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK
            SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART.
            And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words,
            "INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.

                                LUCIAN
                      What'd you name him?

                                JESSE
                      I named him Ray.

            Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens
            cuff-links.

                                LUCIAN
                          (over his shoulder)
                      Heard the cops smacked you around inside.

                                JESSE
                      'Wasn't too bad.

            Lucian checks his hair.

                                LUCIAN
                      You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways
                      than one.

                                JESSE
                      Looks like you done just fine without me.
                      Business rollin' through the door.

            And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring...

                                LUCIAN
                      Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time
                      to raise a family.
                      Time to straighten things out. 
                          (pause)
                      I gave you that time... Then safe jobs
                      start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans.
                      Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys,
                      they think it's niggers, gone widespread
                      on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all
                      professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen.
                      Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.
                          (locked on Jesse)
                      I knew right then and there, only a white
                      respectable burglar could've done this.

            Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well...

            ...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of
            controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of
            tension fall heavily on the room.

                                LUCIAN
                      Jesse... With all the work you been
                      doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe
                      jobs, behind my back...
                          (predatory)
                      Where's the tribute to the greater cause?

            Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the
            desk...

            He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and
            EMERALDS.

                                JESSE
                      Like I said, I just needed time.

            Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and
            EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.

                                LUCIAN
                      Well, even prophets stumble once in a
                      while.

            Lucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear:

                                LUCIAN
                      It's a shame about your brother.

            As they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between
            them...

            I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK, TRAVELING - BACK ROAD - NIGHT

            Jesse at the wheel, glances nervously in the rearview. Lynn
            in the passenger seat, baby in her lap. They're driving under
            the cover of darkness... 

                                LYNN
                      I don't understand. Why do we have to
                      leave the state? You're not tellin' me
                      something. You're not tellin' me a lot.

                                JESSE
                      It ain't safe here no more. You wanted
                      out? This is out.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

            Marandino looks through BINOCULARS: As an electric fence
            slides back. Jesse's truck approaches, drives through.

            EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

            A twin-engine PLANE idylls. Lines of blue lights, strobe like
            rivers, air traffic above... And Bud, leaning against a
            nearby car with Shepard and Cobb.

            Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they
            walk toward the plane...

            Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn.

            OUTSIDE THE PLANE

            Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls
            her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them
            we cannot hear...

            Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the
            door. The engine SCREAMS to life, taking off...

            Jesse turns to shield his face. Lights STROBE and BLAST...
            Then, ABRUPT DARKNESS AND SILENCE... 

            ON JESSE

            now alone on the tarmac. Bud approaches; then...

                                JESSE
                      Lucian took the stones. Talked about
                      jobs. High-end, boxcar.

                                BUD
                      Your family's safe now.
                          (beat)
                      Let's go to work.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. JEWELRY STORE BASEMENT - NIGHT

            Several AB SOLDIERS stand watch as Jesse pushes a heavy, 10"
            drill through a jeweler's vault door... Jesse throws tumbler
            and relock mechanisms aside, reaches in... jewels, gems.

            EXT. PARKING LOT - BETWEEN CARS - NIGHT

            Bud and Jesse parked next to each other, trading info.

            E/I. VARIOUS HIDEOUTS - NIGHT

            AB counterfeiting bills... Printing press and metal plates...
            Hands stain bills with coffee grounds and cigarettes, then
            industrial dryers... Jesse at a table behind tall stacks of
            cash, inspecting, approving...

            INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

            Bud with Jesse. Info, names and written amounts.

            INSERTS: HANDS file serial numbers off guns... HANDS building
            silencers... loading guns in suitcases below false bottoms...

            EXT. PAY PHONES - NIGHT

            Jesse on the line... Bud on the other end, taking notes...

            INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

            AB Soldiers unload crates from trucks, "Chrysler Corp."...
            "Remington Firearms"... Antique furniture... Machinery...

            INSERT: A MONEY MACHINE counts large denominations of cash.

            EXT. BELOW AN OVERPASS - NIGHT

            Parked under the interstate. Bud looks over Jesse's info.

            EXT. NEW ORLEANS PORT - NIGHT

            A large fishing boat arrives. Numerous Fisherman load marlin
            onto refrigerated trucks... Catfish, Buzz, numerous AB start
            up the trucks... Jesse hands the Head Fisherman a canvas bag
            of cash... 

            PULL BACK to reveal Shepard, Cobb and Marandino on the roof
            of a neighboring port, snapping photos. Taking notes.

            E/I. ISOLATED BARN - NIGHT

            Trucks arrive. AB bring the marlin inside... Atop a crate,
            Jesse slices a marlin open, revealing kilos of cocaine. More
            marlins are cut. More cocaine.

            INT. METRO OFFICE - DAY

            Bud on the typewriter, hammering out Jesse's contacts and
            movements. Files piling on his desk.

            INT. METRO OFFICE - NIGHT

            An organizational chart, as Bud pins AB mug shots, arrest
            sheets and surveillance photos wall to wall.

            Bud steps back, observes. His case building. Getting huge.

                                                         MONTAGE OUT/TO:

            EXT. BACK PATIO, LUCIAN'S HOUSE - DAY

            Wood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table.

                                KIERSEY
                      There's a variety of matters to discuss
                      today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial
                      starts next week. One of the jurors
                      reached out. He's asking six thousand up
                      front plus a job at four hundred a week.
                      That guarantees a hung jury with a push
                      for an acquittal.  

                                LUCIAN
                      Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the
                      trucking firm.

                                KIERSEY
                          (as he writes)
                      Construction on the building Morris
                      brought us, in south-east Florida, is
                      complete. Every unit sold. We should see
                      revenues of one point four million over
                      our original projections. 

            Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips.

                                KIERSEY
                      Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle
                      East. They put a final offer on the
                      table. They'll fund our operation in
                      Louisiana if we agree to act on their
                      behalf. Political targets mostly, on the
                      basis of our approval...
                          (beat)
                      I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a
                      sample of their resources.

                                LUCIAN
                      "Final offer?" Demands... 
                          (beat)
                      Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for
                      it. By the time they realize, we'll have
                      our return.
                          (laughs to Jesse)
                      You believe they're travelin' all the way
                      to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed?

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LUCIAN'S BACK YARD - LATER

            Jesse and Lucian walk together through green, expansive
            countryside. A pair of Arabian mares graze nearby.

                                LUCIAN
                      I want you runnin' point on this one...  

                                JESSE
                      I'll be honest, I was hopin' for
                      somethin' bigger.

                                LUCIAN
                      What do you got in mind?

                                JESSE
                      How 'bout a few of them heads off the
                      list?

                                LUCIAN
                      We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz.
                      What do you want to go back to that for?

                                JESSE
                      The money's worth twice this. Bring back
                      a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart,
                      it's thirty, right?

            Lucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny.

                                LUCIAN
                      Tell you what. Do this other thing we got
                      lined up...
                          (beat)
                      Then I'll give you that taste.

            EXT. HENDERSON INDUSTRIAL ZONE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT

            Dark, factory skyline. Burnt out cars sit before a WAREHOUSE.

            INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

            HEADQUARTERS for the Baton Rouge operation. A beehive of
            government activity. TECHNICIANS listen to tapes... PHONES
            ring off the hook... Bud and Fitch going over the case:

                                FITCH
                      There's pressure from Washington. They
                      send compliments for Jesse's work. But
                      our primary concern is that list. I need
                      names we can protect.

                                BUD
                      We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it.

                                FITCH
                      If Jesse can just get a direct order...
                      from Lucian to him, on a wire--

                                BUD
                      --A wire?! He just went back to work, you
                      want him to wear a fuckin' wire?
                          (beat)
                      Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's
                      phone, that's what you should do.

                                FITCH
                      He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get
                      would be inadmissable.

                                BUD
                      It's information, Fitch. 

            Fitch, annoyed, but staying on track.

                                FITCH
                      Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on
                      the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay.
                      He's disconnected from everything, like a
                      ghost. 

            Bud, cooling his heels. As the phones RING and RING...

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            A violent rainfall.

            AERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the
            deep woods to reveal a TRUCK STOP ahead.

            EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade
            is pulled back, allowing entrance...

            Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by
            a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS
            exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LUMBER STORAGE, TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

            The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a
            converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE.

            Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge
            through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement. 

            Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI
            AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS...

            Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth.

            Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with
            cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR)
            reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down... 

            ...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a
            moment.

                                JESSE
                          (low)
                      Catfish.

            Catfish and Omar are eye-to-eye. Then, Catfish lets go with a
            smile:

                                CATFISH
                      Go 'head. Count it.

            The Shiite leader, NASEEM, sees the strife.

                                NASEEM
                      There a problem?

                                JESSE
                      No problem. Money's all there.

            Omar hands the bag to Naseem. The count starts. Both crews
            watch closely...  

            ...All except Catfish, fixated on Omar, who stares back.

                                CATFISH
                      'The fuck you lookin' at...?

            The count stops. Naseem looks to Omar. Questions in Arabic go
            back and forth. The pressure getting to the group...

                                JESSE
                          (low)
                      Catfish, would you shut the fuck up? This
                      ain't the time.

                                NASEEM
                          (to Catfish)
                      Yes, listen to your boss.

                                CATFISH
                      What?! What fuckin' "boss?" You best
                      watch your ass, sand nigger.  

                                NASEEM
                      Piece of shit--!

            Everyone reaches for their guns. Threats SHOUTED in Arabic
            and English.

                                JESSE
                      Take it easy! Take it easy! 

            SUDDENLY ARC LIGHTS BEHIND A DISTANT BARRIER IGNITE, flooding
            the scene. Everyone turns.

                                A VOICE
                          (over a loud speaker)
                      ATF! THE PERIMETER'S SURROUNDED!

            Omar reaches for the bag of cash...

            BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face.

            And World War III erupts.

            AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout
            locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.

            Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.

            SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown
            apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.

            ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.

            Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then
            swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into
            the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.

            Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is
            spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.

            Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and
            PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.

            Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and
            Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.

            IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car
            CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.

            Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.
            WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.

            Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the
            stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.

            The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it
            through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.

            JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the
            construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

            ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way...

            AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF

            lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering
            traffic, to the sound of ongoing GUNFIRE...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. DESOLATE FIELD - LATE NIGHT

            The moon hangs low as Jesse parks the Freight truck among
            tall grass, where a vacant BREAD TRUCK is waiting.

                                                                TIMECUT:

            As Catfish exits the truck...

            ...Jesse takes Catfish's gun, grabs him by the neck and SLAMS
            him against the cab. FACE TO FACE.

                                JESSE
                      You're a piece of work, Catfish.

            Buzz grabs at Jesse; Jesse HURLS him to the ground.

                                CATFISH
                      Them niggers crossed the line...I had to
                      burn 'em--

                                JESSE
                      --You had to keep your mouth shut! On a
                      job, you don't do fuckin' shit 'less I
                      say!

                                CATFISH
                      'The fuck off me--!

            Jesse slams him back again. HOLDS his throat.

                                JESSE
                          (low, deadly)
                      Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave
                      you where I find you. Got that?

            PAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes. 

                                JESSE
                      Unload the fuckin' truck.

            Jesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread
            truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join.

            INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot-out. AGENTS
            work, uncomfortable, as Bud and Fitch argue. Explosive...

                                FITCH
                      Keep your voice down! This was out of my
                      control!

                                BUD
                      I'm telling you, your agents best pull
                      their shit together! Who the hell y'all
                      trying to protect?!

                                FITCH
                      Look, Carter. This is a joint task force
                      with multiple agendas, that run up the
                      chain of command through me. Intel came
                      forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem
                      Kazuri - an international arms dealer -
                      would be present at this meet. ATF was
                      tasked to observe and report. 

                                BUD
                      That ain't what they did--!

                                FITCH
                      --No! Because your informant--

                                BUD
                      My informant, that's right!--

                                FITCH
                      --Your informant and his psychopath crew
                      greased half our political interests --
                      over a bag of fake cash! You weren't
                      informed, so what?

                                BUD
                      Well I better be informed! 'Cause this
                      ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all
                      got a collaborative agenda in the works?
                      I want to see it. These other agencies,
                      what time-lines they lookin' at? What
                      deadlines and why?

                                FITCH
                      Above your pay-grade--

                                BUD
                          (overlapping)
                      And is there a purposeful lack of
                      communication between competing agencies,
                      who are right now charting future
                      mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!

                                FITCH
                      That's not your concern, Carter!

            Braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room...

                                BUD
                      We're not talkin' about me!!

                                BRADDOCK
                      Bud!

                                BUD
                          (spins)
                      What?!

                                BRADDOCK
                      You're over-involved here.

            And Bud's taken off stride. Braddock looks Bud right in the
            eyes, so there's no doubt...

                                BRADDOCK
                      I'll handle this.

            Bud, red with anger, walks out. 

            Braddock watches him go. Fitch comes over, relieved...

                                FITCH
                      Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been
                      berating my agents for the last hour.

            Braddock pours a cup of coffee.

                                FITCH
                      We're trying to band-aid a situation
                      here, and frankly, Carter's preference
                      for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all
                      be in my report...

                                BRADDOCK
                          (interrupts)
                      "Isn't helping?"

            A big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in...

                                BRADDOCK
                      "Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what
                      happened here, Fitch. We work for the
                      same cause doesn't mean we work for you.
                      What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse
                      back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter
                      delivered the biggest informant in the
                      history of this state to your lap, and
                      you and the people you work for are gonna
                      let it go to shit.
                          (beat)
                      You can expect that will be in my report.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

            STEELWORKERS warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs.
            The seven story furnace is deafening.

            ENTRY AREA

            Lucian is met by Kiersey. They walk together through glassed
            in hallways to a closed office door. 

            Lucian keys in, REVEALING a disheveled Morris seated in a
            chair with two large AB Soldiers on either side.

            INT. STEEL MILL OFFICE - PRE DAWN

            Lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris.

                                MORRIS
                      Look. I had no previous knowledge of any
                      business with Muslims. So if stealing me
                      here in the middle of the night, is some
                      kind of accusation--

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I
                      do find it interesting that right about
                      the time I employ you, my operation
                      starts having problems.

                                MORRIS
                      Yes, but--

                                LUCIAN
                      That is interesting...isn't it?

            Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely.

                                LUCIAN
                      I want to know if this was an isolated
                      incident. If the ATF impeding on my work
                      is the result of a deeper threat.

                                MORRIS
                      What are you suggesting?

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm suggesting you contact your friends
                      in Washington.

                                MORRIS
                      With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's
                      not what I was retained for.

                                LUCIAN
                      Well now it is.

                                MORRIS
                      That sort of information requires
                      clearance I don't have. If I start
                      sniffing around, people are going to ask
                      questions.

                                LUCIAN
                      I'm asking questions, Mr. Morris. And I'm
                      getting impatient.

            Morris gets stone quiet. Lucian hands him a phone.

                                LUCIAN
                      You don't leave here till I get answers.

            And like that, this conversation is over.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. LIQUOR STORE + PHONE BOOTH - DAWN

            Off a deserted street. A DENSE FOG resides, far as the eye
            can see. And Jesse, in a PHONE BOOTH, drops a dime and
            dials...

                                LYNN V.O.
                          (clearly asleep)
                      Hello...

                                JESSE
                      It's me.

                                LYNN V.O.
                      You okay?
                          (off Jesse's silence)
                      Honey, you alright?

                                JESSE
                      I'm okay. Just need to hear your voice.
                      How's little Ray...?

                                LYNN V.O.
                      I'll put him on.

            SILENCE for a moment...then a quiet baby's voice. 

                                LYNN V.O.
                      It's daddy on the phone, say hello.

            Emotion rises to Jesse's face. He holds it in, barely.

            ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET 

            a lone CAR is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past... 

            ...Jesse sees it, can't see who's inside it. 

                                LYNN V.O.
                      Jesse?

            He hangs up. 

            A LONG MOMENT... Jesse stands there, watching the car... He
            slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his
            truck is parked. Pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's
            locked. Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck.   

            THERE'S SUDDEN MOVEMENT. Jesse spins. And out of the darkness
            -- steps Bud -- ready to pounce... 

                                BUD
                      Where the hell you been?
                          (Jesse's look)
                      Two days missin', you broke protocol.
                      Three, and you're a flight risk.
                      Agents'll hunt your ass down.

                                JESSE
                          (anger spiking, pacing)
                      I can't keep doin' this. I can't fuckin'
                      breathe. Even the shadows got eyes.    

                                BUD
                      This is the job. If I don't hear from
                      you, I can't protect you.   

                                JESSE
                          (in his face)
                      Protect me?! I about got my head fuckin'
                      shot off, 'cause your guys was
                      "protecting" me!

                                BUD
                      Those ain't my guys!

                                JESSE
                      I don't give a fuck-- I don't want your
                      protection! I want out!

                                BUD
                      There is no "out." Not for either of us.
                      Not till it's done...
                          (low, definitive)
                      Get me that list.

            Jesse STARES -- a malevolence in his eyes that freezes Bud to
            the spot. Then, Jesse climbs in his truck and drives off.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Bud pacing; Braddock sits at his desk.

                                BUD
                      I'm losin' him, Mike...

                                BRADDOCK
                      Just relax. We gotta let things settle,
                      that's all. 

                                BUD
                      It ain't gonna settle, it's gonna blow. I
                      can feel it.  

                                BRADDOCK
                      What do you want me to do?

                                BUD
                      Push 'em back. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      Who?

                                BUD
                      The Feds. All these suits, fuckin'
                      outsiders. Everyone. Get me some room.
                      Some time to reel this thing in. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      I'll talk to Nokes. 'See what I can do.

                                                                  BLACK.

            INT. OFFICE, STEEL MILL - DAY 

            Morris (a nervous wreck, unshaven) sits across from Lucian.
            Kiersey at an adjacent table.

                                MORRIS
                      There's an investigation underway, funded
                      by the U.S. Attorney. And you're the
                      target.

            Morris opens his briefcase and hands over a pair of dossiers.

                                MORRIS
                      They're receiving assistance from both
                      the ATF and FBI, who are stationed right
                      here in Henderson.

                                LUCIAN
                          (pause)
                      How long they been active?

                                MORRIS
                      My sources tell me three months.

            Lucian puts on his reading glasses, opens a dossier.

                                LUCIAN
                      Three months...

            Lucian peruses surveillance photos: Images of AB activity
            goes by in a blur. Lucian's eyes absorbing, rigid, unerring. 

                                KIERSEY
                          (reading)
                      This is U.S. Attorney John Nokes, at the
                      helm. He's been after us for years.

                                LUCIAN
                      Who they got for a mouthpiece?

                                MORRIS
                      A "mouthpiece"?

                                LUCIAN
                      Who's the rat in the woodpile? Who the
                      fuck's giving 'em information?

                                MORRIS
                      I couldn't dig that deep. But it's
                      someone close.
                          (pause)
                      I suggest you gentlemen disband.

            INT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse, alone in the dark, seated on the couch... There's a
            SOUND outside... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            Jesse moves soundlessly through the house, gun ready, toward
            the back door.

            JESSE'S POV: as the door opens slow, HE/WE SEE ON THE PORCH: 

            LUCIAN

            seated comfortably in a chair... 

                                LUCIAN
                      Couldn't sleep.

            Jesse looks to the darkness. Dogwood trees. Thick growth.
            EERIE SILENCE...

                                JESSE
                      Got somethin' on your mind? 

                                LUCIAN
                          (without looking at him)
                      There's been an adjustment to the list,
                      Jesse...

            Jesse's silent. YOU CAN CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE...

                                LUCIAN
                      We got this...heathen. A whore of an
                      Irishman...down in Baton Rouge.
                      He's protected. Got a lot of guys around
                      him. That's why it pays. That's why
                      nobody wants the job... That's why we're
                      here talkin'.

                                JESSE
                      Who is it?

            Lucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address
            written on back. 

            Jesse flips over the photo: It's Bud, in uniform. 

                                LUCIAN
                      This cop... he's got a mouthpiece...
                      somewhere. Ain't yet figured out who.
                      In the meantime, shut him down.

            ON JESSE, a frozen moment. He forces out the words:

                                JESSE
                      It's done.

            With that, Lucian gets up and leaves, disappearing into
            darkness.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse climbs into his truck and pulls out to the street... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            JESSE'S TRUCK heading up the INTERSTATE, crossing into EAST
            BATON ROUGE, then driving through dark RESIDENTIAL STREETS of
            Bud's neighborhood...

            I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK - LATE NIGHT

            He pulls to the curb, parks. Jesse racks a MOSSBERG SG, loads
            it with solid shot, then lays the gun on his lap. 

            THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Bud's house in the distance.

            And Jesse sits there, several moments...WAITS...BREATHES...
            Then he exits the truck...

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse moves -- fast, soundless -- toward the house. With his
            shotgun, scales the fence, as we--

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. DOWN THE STREET, BY JESSE'S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

            A VAN arrives, stops. No headlights, two hundred yards from
            the house. INSIDE THE VAN: Catfish and Buzz. Several AB
            SOLDIERS in back, armed to the teeth.

                                BUZZ
                      That's his truck.

                                CATFISH
                          (nods)
                      Let's see what he does.

            The motor ticks and ticks and...

            EXT. SIDE YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            It's dark, quiet; but the muted glow of a tv in the living
            room. JESSE MOVES IN SHADOW, shotgun leading... He stops.
            LISTENS... 

            WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HARD WATER FROM A SINK OFF-SCREEN

            ...Jesse moves toward it...

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Catfish, Buzz, the soldiers watching Bud's house intently.

                                CATFISH
                      The fuck's takin' so long? 
                          (beat)
                      I would've shot that pig dead already...
                      'made a pulled-pork sandwich.

                                BUZZ
                      Give him a minute. That's a cop, lives
                      there. 

                                CATFISH
                          (checks his watch)
                      I'll give him two.

            Catfish, loading his gun, as--

            EXT. YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Through a window, WE SEE Bud washing dishes. Then, slipping
            INTO FRAME...

            JESSE

            watching him. Pulse pounding, his mind on overdrive, trying
            to untangle identity and consequence... Then...

            He taps the window, and Bud looks up...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            THE BACK DOOR

            Bud opens it:

                                BUD
                      Jesse. 'The hell you doin' here?

                                JESSE
                      You been made, Bud. We gotta skin out.

                                                                BACK TO:

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Catfish, anxious now, racking his gun again and again.

                                CATFISH
                      Somethin's wrong... 

                                BUZZ
                      Relax, Catfish. You said two minutes.

                                CATFISH
                      Fuck you, man! This don't feel right.

                                BUZZ
                      Just give it a second. 
                          (to soldiers in back)
                      A few more seconds, right guys?

            Catfish, breathing hard, bent on bloodshed...

                                CATFISH
                      Let's kill 'em both. Let's do it now,
                      right now, let's go--

                                BUZZ
                      Catfish--

                      LET'S GO!!!

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT 

            Bud quickly dials the phone --

                                SHEPARD V.O.
                          (over phone, answers)
                      Yeah.

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      Hey. Meet me at the office in ten
                      minutes. Cobb and Marandino too.

                                SHEPARD V.O.
                          (over phone)
                      Why, what's up?

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      I'll explain later. Just get there. Now.

            QUICK CUTS as Bud hangs up, shoves a .38 in his waistband.
            Slams a clip and holsters a 9MM.

                                BUD
                          (to Jesse)
                      Let's hit it.

            Bud and Jesse start for the door...

            INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT 

            AB Soldiers loading their guns. 

            CATFISH

            starts the engine; POV THRU THE WINDSHIELD: Jesse and Bud,
            leaving the house.

                                CATFISH
                      That's them! Together, you see?!

                                BUZZ
                      I see 'em--

                                CATFISH
                      You see?! They're fuckin' dead!

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Jesse hurries down the lawn. Bud to his Chevy.

            SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF TIRES BURN... CATFISH'S VAN SEARS DOWN
            THE STREET...

            ...THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN AS AB SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE FROM SUB
            MACHINE GUNS. 

            Jesse drops behind a neighbor's sedan.

            Bud dives behind the Chevy. ROUNDS SLAM through sheet metal,
            interior, and out the other end. 

            AB Soldiers exit the van, spread and keep FIRING. Jesse's
            sedan takes hits. WINDOWS AND TIRES EXPLODE. 

            Bud and Jesse aim over their roofs. Take and RETURN FIRE. 

            Catfish emerges, kneels and pumps SHOTS into Bud's Chevy.

            The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART -- Shattered glass covers Bud.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SHEPARD'S CAR, TRAVELING - LATE NIGHT 

            Shepard at the wheel. We hear dispatch on the police scanner:

                                DISPATCHER V.O.
                          (filter)
                      All units: 10-17 in progress. 1825
                      Hyacinth. Multiple shots fired--

                                SHEPARD
                      What the fuck?

                                DISPATCHER V.O.
                      --Units please respond...

            Shepard hits the BRAKES, peels a hard U-turn and SLAMS the
            gas toward Bud's house...

                                                                BACK TO:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

            Buzz rounds the van and OPENS FIRE.

            Jesse and Bud cover. Their eyes connect. Bud signals towards
            the house. Jesse nods...

            ...then lays cover fire with the Mossberg. AB #3 is spun and
            thrown. 

            Bud, under fire and firing back, races back into the house.

            Jesse keeps FIRING.

            I/E. BUD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

            Bud YANKS an M-16 from the closet and slams the door.

            OUTSIDE

            Jesse, on his knees, pulls a secondary .45 from his waistband
            and fires over the hood of the sedan.

            CATFISH FIRES HIS SHOTGUN AND JESSE'S HAND EXPLODES IN HALF.

                                JESSE
                          (crumbles hard)
                      Fuck!

            Jesse hits the dirt, WRIST PUMPING BLOOD.

            AB #4 and #5 move in for the kill, when out of nowhere --
            SHEPARD'S CAR SPEEDS ON SCENE -- His door kicks out; SHEPARD
            PUMPS SHOTS, EXCHANGING.

            Buzz comes up from behind, aims -- BULLETS FLASH AND PUNCH
            THROUGH SHEPARD.

            INSIDE THE HOUSE 

            Bud swings the M-16 through the glass and BLASTS AWAY,
            killing AB #4, as Jesse staggers toward the house, holding
            his wrist...

            ...and DIVES inside, then kicks the door shut.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

            Catfish, Buzz and AB Soldiers flank the house.

            INT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

            On the floor, Jesse rips out his belt, a tourniquet around
            the armpit. He holds it with his teeth and ties his arm.

            Bud reloads and slides Jesse a .357 Python. Jesse takes it up
            with his good hand.

            Suddenly in the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES DISCHARGE.
            THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS EXPLODE. Bud ducks, scrambles, as
            rounds splinter the wall. 

            A BACK KITCHEN DOOR is bashed open and AB #5 steps in,
            BLAZING SHOTS.

            Bud lets fly -- FIRING. Big bore rounds punch through AB #5.
            His insides hit the wall. 

            WE NOW HEAR DISTANT POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING...

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET - SAME

            A LONG-HAIRED AB on the lawn fires dozens of shots from an  
            M-1.

            Catfish and Bud exchange CROSSFIRE as...

            ...Buzz starts up the van and Catfish jumps in, followed by
            Long-Hair...

            I/E. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET

            Bud runs out to the street, M-16 FIRING at the fleeing van.

            Bullets shatter the back window as the van speeds around the
            corner through garbage cans and a residential fence...

            ON BUD

            standing there. He turns, and STOPS when he SEES...

            SHEPARD

            inert, bullet-ridden.

                                BUD
                      Shepard!
                          (runs over)
                      No...

            Bud holds his partner, horrified. Around them, bodies on the
            lawn. Disabled vehicles. Doom overlays the property.

                                                                TIMECUT:

            EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

            Pandemonium as the street is clogged with POLICE VEHICLES and
            MEDIC UNITS. Braddock arrives with Cobb and Marandino.

            Bud moves alongside a PARAMEDIC wheeling a gurneyed Jesse,
            with a pressure bandage and splint, onto an ambulance.

                                BUD
                          (turns to Braddock)
                      We run 'em now, Mike. Right fuckin' now!

                                BRADDOCK
                          (nods)
                      What do you need?

                                                               SMASH TO:

            E/I. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - PRE DAWN

            A huge BATTERING RAM knocks it right off the hinges. SWAT,
            Bud rush in with rifles...

            ...Room by room. Everyone clears. The house is empty.

                                SWAT #1
                      Nothing.

            E/I. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

            SWAT TEAMS have secured the premises. Two HELICOPTERS sweep
            the grounds via SPOTLIGHT. A manhunt for Lucian Adams.

            INSIDE, Cobb on his radio: 

                                COBB
                      No one here, Bud...

            INT. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

            Bud listens on his radios as SWAT OFFICERS file out of the
            vacant house.

                                COBB V.O.
                          (radio filter)
                      Empty. 

            Bud stands there, infuriated...

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. TRAUMA CENTER, OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

            Jesse, unconscious in bed, with IV lines re-infusing plasma.
            Bud is with a DOCTOR, who washes his hands in a sink...

                                DOCTOR
                      His bleeding's under control. There's
                      tissue damage. Projectile fragmentation
                      in the right forearm. We have most of it
                      removed. Two fingers are gone. A portion
                      of the palm. There's no chance of
                      reconstruction.
                          (Bud's silence)
                      I'll be monitoring his vitals.

            Doctor walks away. Bud turns as a NURSE dims the lights and
            pulls the curtains, obscuring Jesse...

            I/E. OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

            Bud, absorbed, walks past crowded emergency room activity...

            OUTSIDE

            Braddock is waiting. 

                                BRADDOCK
                          (stares for a moment)
                      You have to let go now.

            Bud says nothing.

                                BRADDOCK
                      It's over.

                                BUD
                      It's not.

                                BRADDOCK
                          (in his eyes)
                      The cover's blown. Lucian's gone. There
                      ain't nothin' left on this one.

            Bud, hearing it. Feeling every bit of it.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Get to a safe-house, Bud. 
                          (hands Bud a set of keys)
                      'Squad car over there is your's.

            Braddock walks off. Bud watches him go.

            INT. SQUAD CAR, TRAVELING - DAWN

            Bud drives in dark silence. As the hospital recedes, Bud
            pulls a flask from his coat, takes a drink...

                                                                  BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            Sunlight rises through a gap in the dark sky. 

            EXT. CEMETARY - MORNING - DAYS LATER

            SHEPARD'S FUNERAL. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN saluting as a PRIEST
            gives the eulogy. 

            BUD 

            at the gravesite, with Braddock, Cobb and Marandino. A salute
            is FIRED with rifles.

            LATER

            Bud stands alone. Dry-eyed, vacant stare.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE STREETS - DAY

            Flashbulbs burst rapid-fire as coroner crews and police
            secure a crime scene: Richard Morris sits dead at the wheel
            of his car, a plastic bag over his head filled with blood.  

            IN THE FOREGROUND, lit by police lights, is Bud and Cobb.

                                COBB
                      ...His cranium was smashed with a lead
                      pipe. Then the plastic bag. He choked to
                      death while it filled up with blood.

                                BUD
                      Got I.D.?

                                COBB
                      'Name's Richard Morris. He's a top dog
                      lawyer-lobbyist out of Washington.

            Cobb proffers Morris' wallet. Bud sifts through cards --
            Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one:

            "Daniel J. Kiersey, Attorney at Law" 

                                BUD
                      Put a tap on that line.

                                COBB
                      Braddock ain't gonna like it.

                                BUD
                      Do it.

            Braddock arrives on scene. Disturbed expression:

                                BRADDOCK
                      Bud. I just got off with Nokes. 

                                BUD
                      And?

                                BRADDOCK
                      We got a problem.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

            A PARTITIONER bandages Jesse's swollen and stitched hand. Two
            fingers and thumb remain.

            There's a KNOCK O.S.

            Jesse looks up to see Bud enter from the hallway.

                                BUD
                      Give us a minute, Doc.

            Partitioner exits. Jesse, raw nerves raked. Looks to Bud. 

                                JESSE
                      Where you been?

            Lynn emerges from the grocery, looking sad and prematurely
            aged. Her baby in the cart, tucked between bags of food. 

            FBI #3 (TOM) helps Lynn and the baby into an Unmarked Car.

            INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR, TRAVELING

            Lynn sits in back with the baby. Tom, at the wheel.

                                TOM
                      Anything else while we're out, Mrs.
                      Wheeler?

                                LYNN
                      No thank you.

            THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: FLASHING CONSTRUCTION LIGHTS come
            into view. A DETOUR. And a team of LABORERS at work. 

                                                                BACK TO:

                      There's a dozen cops comin' in and outta
                      this place. No one's sayin' shit. 'The
                      hell's goin' on?

            Bud stares intently, waits for his cue, can't find it...

            INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR - FLASHBACK

            LABORER #1 steps INTO FRAME with a STOP SIGN.

                                LABORER #1
                          (approaches Tom's window)
                      Wait here a moment, sir.

            A crane moves past, hoisting steel. Tom IDLES the engine.
            Then:

                                LABORER #1
                          (gestures)
                      Thanks for waiting. Go ahead.

            Tom drives onward, glancing in the REARVIEW: at Laborer #1
            watching them pull away, receding in the distance...

                      family.

            Bud, the pit in his stomach widening, struggles to say:

                                BUD
                      There is no family.

            INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR - FLASHBACK 

            Tom - calm and alert - looks to his right - SEES a child's
            BICYCLE parked on the sidewalk. A BACKPACK affixed to the
            handlebars... 

            EXPLODES

            A MASSIVE GOEX BLAST IN TWO DIRECTIONS. HITS THE CAR'S REAR
            DOOR, CUTTING STEEL.  

            WINDSHIELDS OF PARKED CARS SHATTER. NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES. THE
            CAR IS BLOWN SIDEWAYS AND WRAPS AROUND A LIGHT POST. 

            THE CAR'S FRONT DOOR DROPS OPEN AND TOM CRAWLS OUT. CHARRED.
            BURNING. LAST GASP OF LIFE.

            EXT. ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

            A CARGO VAN pulls up and parks. The Labor Team abandons it,
            dumping gloves and outer clothing into plastic bags,
            REVEALING: A CREW OF AB SOLDIERS LEAD BY CATFISH. 

            The bags go in the back of a waiting SUBURBAN. Catfish takes
            the wheel. The crew climbs in, drives away. 

                                                                BACK TO:

            ON JESSE. Absorbing this. His face begins to tremble. Eyes
            press shut. They fill with moisture as he looks away.

            HOLD ON BUD. Quiet. Struggling to hide his own emotion. 

                                BUD
                      I'm sorry...

            And he walks out.

            INT. HALLWAY, REHABILITATION WARD

            MOVING WITH BUD, as he heads for the exit. Under harsh

            Pouring rain.

            It's a madhouse outside. A crowd is gathered around a police
            action in progress. MEDICS are tending to the broken nose of
            a bartender (PETE) in his 30s. METRO COP #1 stands by. 

            A car pulls up and Cobb gets out with Marandino. They
            approach the bartender.

                                BARTENDER
                          (to Metro #1)
                      He's out of his mind. 'Asked him to slow
                      down; and he punched me in the face.

            Cobb and Marandino approach.

                                COBB
                          (to bartender)
                      Hey, Pete. You alright?

                                BARTENDER
                      I'm alright. The bar ain't. 

                                MARANDINO
                          (to Metro #1)
                      We'll smooth it out. Clear the street.

            Cobb and Marandino start toward the bar.

            INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - NIGHT

            The place is A MESS. Chairs broken, tables overturned. Music
            BLARES on the jukebox. And empty except Bud... three sheets
            to the wind, drunk. Pacing the ruins with his 9MM in hand...

                                BUD
                      Y'all fuck with me? Huh? You want to fuck
                      with me?

            Cobb and Marandino peer in the doorway to see Bud, shouting
            and threatening a vacant chair.

                                COBB
                      Jesus Christ.

            Bud flips another table. Continues talking to the chair as if
            someone were in it. 

                                BUD
                      'Look at me when I talk to you.
                          (aims his 9MM)
                      You try and kill me? You like killin'
                      women and kids?

            Bud holsters his gun and beats the shit out of the chair.

                                COBB O.S.
                      Bud...

            Bud spins, glass-eyed and red-faced. His wavering vision can
            barely make out Cobb and Marandino approaching...

                                MARANDINO
                      Easy, Bud... Easy...  

                                COBB
                      We got you here, Bud... It's just us.
                      Hear me?

            Bud stands his ground, tries to keep his balance...

                                COBB
                      Let's go home...

            There's a long moment. Bud stares at his crew, gone. Then
            he's suddenly overwhelmed with emotion...

            INT. REHABILITATION WARD - MORNING

            Two FBI AGENTS #4 and #5 walk together down this sterile
            corridor. They stop outside Jesse's closed door. A uniformed
            POLICE OFFICER is posted there, reading a newspaper. 

                                FBI #4
                      We're here to escort Mr. Wheeler.

                                POLICE OFFICER
                          (holds up a chart)
                      Sign this.

            FBI #4 signs the chart. The two agents enter...

            INT. JESSE'S ROOM

            Jesse's bed is empty. The window open. Curtains billowing.

                                FBI #4
                      Check the bathroom.

            FBI #5 opens the bathroom door. Empty. Both Agents hurry to
            the window, SEE OUTSIDE: A large TREE six feet out from the
            ledge and a broken branch at street level. A seemingly
            impossible escape route.

                                FBI #4 (CONT'D)
                      Sonofabitch. This guy's crazy.

            INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - MORNING

            A badly hung-over Bud sits with Braddock, Fitch and numerous
            agents around a conference table. 

            NOKES

            walks the room, says to all:

                                NOKES
                      This is an atrocity, gentlemen.
                      Incompetence at it's highest level. I
                      gave you my name. My resources. My
                      trust...Carte blanche. And now this
                      handsome face of mine...can't step foot
                      in Washington, for fear of being laughed
                      off the Hill.

            Nokes circles behind Bud...

                                NOKES
                      Now, I'd love to point to Local on this.
                      But truth is, they've carried their
                      weight. We are federally fucked... 
                          (looks right at Fitch)
                      Because Federal fucked up.

            Fitch wipes sweat, swallows hard.

                                NOKES
                      So. Best idea wins, gentlemen. Chain of
                      command? Point of procedure? I don't give
                      a fuck. That's out the window, just like
                      our informant... 
                          (beat)
                      I want Jesse Wheeler found. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. HALLWAY, FEDERAL BUILDING

            As everyone files out. Braddock says low to Bud:

                                BRADDOCK
                      You smell like a fuckin' distillery, Bud.
                      Clean up... 'find your boy.

            ON BUD. Tired eyes. Everything else, and now this...

            INT. STORAGE GARAGE - DAY 

            A metal door rises up. Jesse, in silhouette, steps in.

            A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement.

            Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked
            in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS.

            Jesse hefts his choices. Checking line and breach: A 12 Gauge
            Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with
            pistol grip. Les Baer Tactical .45. Glock Semi-auto 9MM. Buck
            Knife. Duct tape. 5-Gallon gas cans. He loads up a gym bag.

            Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a
            grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers,
            shaves his scalp and mustache. 

            Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler. Pops the
            trunk. Throws in the gym bag. Then drives away. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. BAYOU GHOULA - NIGHT

            A lone, dilapidated HOUSE BOAT sits heavily in the bayou.
            Lights on inside. Dense FOG overlays.

            INT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            Long-Hair on the couch, watching tv, drinking liquor. SPEED
            METAL MUSIC blasts from a stereo somewhere.

            There's a METALLIC BANG O.S.

            Long-Hair looks up.

            The screen door rattles. Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat,
            slowly approaching...

                                LONG-HAIR
                      Who's there?

            Sudden surprise as the screen SNAPS OFF and a SILHOUETTE
            breaks the glass, opens it.

                                LONG-HAIR
                      What the fuck?!

            Long-Hair RUSHES for the door as THE BUTT OF A 12-GAUGE SLAMS
            DOWN LIKE A TOMAHAWK.

            Long-Hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream.

            Jesse steps in, racking the gauge with one hand, takes aim on
            the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            The front lights go out. A terrible darkness.

            INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

            A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in.
            Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck.

            They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing
            LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each
            step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under
            a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward,
            reaches the doorway, creeps through...

            INT. BEDROOM

            The door swings wide on the room, REVEALING: Buzz, on the
            bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired HOOKER, over a bureau.

            As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse.
            Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once.   

            The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking.
            Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't.

            The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner.

            Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo
            explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence.

            Jesse tosses clothes to the Hooker.

                                JESSE
                      Get out.

            The Hooker does.

            INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

            Two chairs. Buzz and Long-Hair back to back. Hands and feet
            tied. Blood spigoting. Jesse circles them with the shotgun.

            The boat rocks gently.

                                JESSE
                      We got some shit to discuss.

            Buzz, to Jesse, unintimidated:

                                BUZZ
                      Ain't got nothin' to say to you, Wheeler.

                                LONG-HAIR
                          (top of his lungs)
                      I need a doctor! I need a fuckin' doctor!

            In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to
            Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

            Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING
            a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

                                BUZZ
                      FUCK! FUCK! OH, FUCK!

                                JESSE
                      House call.

            Jesse YANKS Buzz up. His chair rocks upright, into place.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?!

                                BUZZ
                      I don't know!

            Jesse punctuates, shotgun butt against Buzz's head. Neck
            snaps. Teeth rattle.

                                BUZZ
                      NO ONE KNOWS WHERE LUCIAN IS! NO ONE
                      KNOWS-

            Jesse strikes again, connects. Buzz goes down in a heap, eyes
            swollen purple slits. His skull gushing red.

                                BUZZ
                      ...fuck...

            Jesse steps over Buzz, pins the shotgun to his jaw.

                                JESSE
                      Who killed my family?

                                BUZZ
                      Ah shit, man!

            Jesse shifts his aim an inch, pulls the trigger. SHOT REVERBS
            HARD. Buzz SCREAMS, hysteria. 

                                JESSE
                          (racks another shell)
                      WHO KILLED 'EM?! CATFISH?!

                                BUZZ
                      CATFISH, YES, YEAH! FUCKIN' CATFISH!

            Jesse puts down the shotgun. Pulls from his gym bag, two CANS
            OF GASOLINE, one of which, he splashes over Buzz's face.

                                BUZZ
                          (flinches)
                      The fuck is that?
                          (sniffs, realizes)
                      WAIT, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?!

            Jesse pours the rest over Buzz and the lifeless Long-Hair.

                                BUZZ
                          (thrashing)
                      NO! NO, NO, NO, DON'T!! DON'T!!

            As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead
            aim...FIRES.

            THE MUZZLE FLASH. GASOLINE IGNITES. BUZZ GOES UP IN FLAMES.

            Instantly, a FIRE ERUPTS. Buzz and Long-Hair's corpses BURN.

            Jesse empties the other can of gas, FEEDING THE FLAMES. THE
            FIRE SPREADS. BURNING THE WALLS. THE FLOOR AND CEILING.

            Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his
            face. For a moment, it's a vision in hell.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            EXT. HOUSE BOAT, BAYOU GHOULA - PRE DAWN

            Engulfed in flames. SIRENS and LIGHTS as FIRE TRUCKS and FIRE
            BOATS douse the burning boat with hard water.

            Among a crowd of SPECTATORS, the shaken Hooker is being
            questioned by Marandino.

            Bud and Cobb stand apart. 

                                COBB
                      We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty
                      eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's
                      he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through
                      the front door.   

            Bud starts leaving the scene. Suddenly FITCH and two AGENTS
            barge forward.

                                FITCH
                      Carter! We need to talk. 

                                BUD
                      Get out of my way, Fitch.

                                FITCH
                          (following Bud)
                      This is my investigation. Jesse's cowboy
                      bullshit is not how it's done!

                                BUD
                      While your agents build their cases and
                      set for court, he'll erase the debt owed
                      to all of you. Overnight.

                                FITCH
                      So you're implying I should thank him?

            Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking...

                                FITCH
                      Look, Carter, whether we like it or not,
                      you and I have to work together on this.
                      We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full
                      protection, if he agrees to testify. 

                                BUD
                      That'll never happen.

                                FITCH
                      Why the hell not?!

                                BUD
                          (turns)
                      'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He
                      has nothing. Why do you think he lit that
                      fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he
                      doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want
                      it. He would've just left 'em for dead.

                                FITCH
                      For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not
                      taking the fall for this! The plan is--

                                BUD
                      No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got
                      balls big enough to relate to this guy.
                      If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be
                      in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in
                      this situation. And you wouldn't be
                      askin' stupid fuckin' questions!
                          (walking away)
                      I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your
                      agents off my ass.

            Bud storms off.

                                                                  BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            EXT. WHISKEY BAY (BLEACH BYPASS) - DAWN - IMAGINATION

            Lynn stumbles through the woods, holding her baby. Scared.
            Lost. Their skin bleached-out. Eyes hollow. Like apparitions.

            We're in a dream. A sadistic enhancement.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

            JESSE'S EYES

            His family's image dissolves inside them.

            WIDEN to reveal Jesse before a cracked mirror in a SERVICE
            STATION BATHROOM. Perspiring, he re-bandages his hand as
            blood swirls down the drain. 

            INT. CORRIDOR, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

            An expensively dressed Kiersey emerges from a courtroom,
            flanked by a pair of well dressed AIDES.

                                KIERSEY
                      Get back to the office. Follow up on the
                      Arthur Bierce case. I need names and
                      numbers on my desk by three pm.

            The Aides scurry down another corridor, as Kiersey exits the
            building through the glass front doors...

            INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

            Kiersey moves to a parked Cadillac pops the trunk and sets
            his briefcase inside, when...

            A RUSHING POV FROM BEHIND: Slams the trunk on Kiersey's hands.

            Kiersey SCREAMS, drops to his knees. His wrists wedged in the
            trunk. And standing over him...is Bud.

                                KIERSEY
                      OH, CHRIST! JESUS CHRIST! MY HANDS!

                                BUD
                      You know who I am?

                                KIERSEY
                      OPEN THE TRUNK! PLEASE! OPEN THE TRUNK!

            Bud kicks him in the stomach, doubles him over.

                                BUD
                      You know who the fuck I am?!

                                KIERSEY
                      YES!

                                BUD
                      Who's Richard Morris?! Why was he killed?

            No answer. Bud pounds on the trunk. Kiersey CRIES OUT.

                                BUD
                      I'll break every fuckin' bone you got.
                      Start talkin'.

                                KIERSEY
                          (hyperventilating)
                      I can't-- I can't--

            Bud slams both fists on the trunk. All his weight.

                                BUD
                          (off Kiersey's SCREAM)
                      Can't what?! What can't you do?!

            Bud, enraged, kicks Kiersey's ribs in. Again.

                                BUD
                      You piece of shit, talk!

                                KIERSEY
                          (hysterical)
                      He made Jesse...The investigation...
                      Everything...

                                BUD
                      His family?

                                KIERSEY
                      Everything! After that, he was just a
                      loose end!

            Bud opens the trunk. Kiersey crumbles to the ground, shaking.

                                BUD
                      Where's Lucian Adams?

                                KIERSEY
                      I don't know!

            Bud jams a foot in Kiersey's neck. Grabs his hands and bends.
            We HEAR bones snap.

                                BUD
                      Lucian's goin' down. You either go down
                      together, or you give him to me.

                                KIERSEY
                          (a mile a minute)
                      I never talk to him directly! I swear,
                      they page me-- 

            Bud roughly searches Kiersey.

                                KIERSEY
                      --Every night at five, for a six o'clock
                      call! They page from different numbers!

            Bud finds a PAGER on Kiersey's slacks, yanks it off. Then
            leans down with a smile, venomous:

                                BUD
                      You're a dead man, Kiersey.

            Bud storms off. Kiersey on the ground, a trembling mess.

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            Catfish does a rail of meth off the counter.

            He lights a cigarette and sits down in a re-upholstered lazy
            boy where a TATTOO ARTIST is setting up... 

            Catfish proffers his forearm, displaying a row of notches
            (kills). And Tattoo Artist begins to outline two more...

                                TATTOO ARTIST
                      'Bout out of room, Catfish. You best
                      start collectin' scalps.

            Catfish smugs. Drags on his cigarette...

            WHEN A SUDDEN GUNSHOT SPRAYS CATFISH WITH BLOOD. Tattoo
            Artist drops dead on the floor.

                                CATFISH
                          (looks up)
                      What the fuck?!

            Jesse, standing over Catfish. A .45 comes down twice fast
            with a CRACK! Catfish is knocked cold.

            INT. BUD'S CAR - DAY

            Bud, on police radio, driving high-speed.

                                BUD
                      What do you got? 

                                                               INTERCUT:

            INT. METRO OFFICE - SAME

            Bud's VOICE over speaker phone. Marandino on the line with a
            sheaf of paperwork. Cobb enters.

                                MARANDINO
                      He's in the French Quarter. All numbers
                      paging Kiersey between five and six p.m.,
                      the last seventy-two hours, are pay
                      phones within a three mile radius.

                                BUD
                      Alright.

                                COBB
                      Bud, you gotta talk to Braddock. He's
                      lookin' for you, he's fuckin' pissed. 

                                BUD
                      Hold him off. I'll square it with him
                      when I get to the Quarter. 

            Bud punches the gas, traveling 90 mph.

            INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

            CATFISH'S EYES blink awake - pinpoint dilated. WIDEN TO
            REVEAL he's stripped to his boxers, tied to the lazy-boy.

            And Jesse is seated beside him.

                                JESSE
                      I'm gonna ask questions... 

            Jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various HARDWARE towards him:
            Needles. Rusted pliers. An electric tattoo drill.

                                JESSE
                      When I'm satisfied with your answers, I'm
                      gonna kill you. How long it takes and how
                      much blood you want to spill...that's up
                      to you.

            Catfish grins. A wide, Amphetamine smile.

                                CATFISH
                      What do you want to know? Want to hear
                      about your brother? How we had him shot
                      up with strychnine? How he died slow
                      death?

            Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,
            and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS
            RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

            Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD
            SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

            Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

                                CATFISH
                      OH, YOU SONOFABITCH!!!

                                JESSE
                      Four days ago, my wife and son were
                      killed.
                          (pause)
                      I hear you took the contract?

            Catfish smiles. Lips quivering with hate.

                                CATFISH
                      Forty-four pounds, Miznay-Schardin. Like
                      you taught me. Fuck yeah, I took it. Blew
                      your bitch and kid sky high.

            Jesse grabs the pliers, YANKS another tooth. Catfish HOWLS.

                                CATFISH
                      MOTHERFUCKER!!!

            BLOOD SPEWS as the drill digs in. Catfish SCREAMS. Jesse
            tosses teeth on the tray.

                                CATFISH
                          (thrashing wildly)
                      OH, YOU'RE GONNA DIE! YOU'RE GONNA
                      FUCKIN' DIE!

            Jesse grabs Catfish's rapidly swelling jaw and yanks hard.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

            Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's
            mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face... 

            ...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.
            Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

                                JESSE
                      Where's he hidin' out?

            Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin: 

                                CATFISH
                      Get fucked.

            THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth
            crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

            Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around
            the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor
            bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:  

            A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.  

            Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,
            drawing fluid...

            ...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip
            of the needle, pops a cc.  

            Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

            Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.

                                JESSE
                      Where's Lucian?

                                CATFISH
                          (barely audible)
                      New Orleans...

                                JESSE
                      New Orleans. Where in New Orleans?

                                CATFISH
                      New Orleans...

            Jesse looks Catfish dead in the eyes. And death is there...
            Begging.

                                JESSE
                          (softly)
                      I believe you.

            With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly.

            Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse
            and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            JESSE'S CAR racing up I-10, along the roaring Mississippi,

            I/E. BUD'S CAR - LOWER FRENCH QUARTER - DUSK

            TIGHT ON A DASHBOARD CLOCK: 5:04 p.m.

            Bud, waiting, parked outside a POLICE PRECINCT in the Lower
            French Quarter. Kiersey's pager on the dash. Waiting. Then:

            THE PAGER BUZZES.

            Bud grabs it, hurries out to a nearby pay-phone. Dials... 

                                BUD
                          (into phone)
                      It's Bud. I got a number. 

                                                               INTERCUT:

                                BUD
                      Get your ass down here.

            Bud slams down the phone. Jumps in his car. Hits the gas.

            EXT. GOVERNOR NICHOLLS WHARF - DUSK

            A busy promenade near the down river end of the Mississippi.

            Bud waits low in his car, parked in a distant lot. Through
            the windshield, WE SEE the subject of his surveillance...

            A PAY-PHONE

            on a crowded sidewalk. Faces pass. A Man in a JACKET arrives
            at the phone. He waits. Checks his watch...

            ...Bud checks his clock: 6:10

            The "Jacket" picks up the phone and dials...

            KIERSEY'S PAGER GOES OFF. 

                                BUD
                      Here we go.

            Jacket waits. No call. Walks away. Bud FOLLOWS on foot...

            EXT. FRENCH MARKET - DUSK

            A sprawling swirl of humanity, live jazz and bars. The Jacket
            passes through. Twenty feet back, Bud keeps pace...  

            ANOTHER PHONE BOOTH

            Jacket enters. Pumps coins into the PAY-PHONE. Dials... 

                                RECEPTIONIST V.O.
                          (recording)
                      You've reached the law offices of Daniel
                      J. Kiersey--

            Jacket hangs up. More coins. Another number...

                                KIERSEY'S VOICE V.O.
                          (recording)
                      Hello, you've reached the Kiersey
                      residence. No one's home right now--

            Jacket hangs up. Exits east onto BARRACKS STREET. Glances
            over his shoulder, then ahead, as Bud rounds the corner...

            EXT. DECATUR AVENUE

            Jacket crosses into a LIQUOR STORE. 

            Bud stalls at the corner, casing the street. Takes everything
            in. He reaches for his cigarettes, finds a crumpled back.
            Then crosses the street to...

            A NEWSSTAND

            outside the liquor store. Bud buys cigarettes and a newspaper.

            He opens the paper, glances at the headlines. At the same
            time, peers into the LIQUOR STORE WINDOW... 

            ...The Jacket walks toward the back of the store and out a
            door to an ALLEY.

            Bud heads south on Decatur. Lights a cigarette, as he passes
            various stores on the block. A private two-story building
            with blacked out windows at the far end: "TIBEDAUX'S TAVERN".

            Bud turns into... 

            EXT. A COBBLESTONE ALLEY

            Lined with boutiques on one side. Back of Tibedaux's on the
            other. A cargo gate is up and MEN are hoisting crates into a
            truck...  

            The Jacket is there, talking to them:

                                JACKET
                      Should've been on the road twenty minutes
                      ago. Hurry it up. 

            Bud pauses at a DRESS SHOP. Stares into the storefront glass,
            reflecting the Jacket and Men...   

            Jacket walks off. Bud flicks his cigarette, enters...

            INT. THE DRESS SHOP

            ...and peers out the window, watching the Jacket leave the
            alley and enter a FRENCH COLONIAL.

            INT. FRENCH COLONIAL, LOBBY - DUSK

            A SECURITY GUARD behind a desk. As Jacket walks in... 

                                SECURITY GUARD
                      What's goin' on, Jack?

            Jacket moves through a warren of CORRIDORS. Hardened MEN
            shuttle in and out of private offices. Plates on the doors:
            "Material Management." "Plating & Metal". "Demolition"...  

            Jacket knocks on a door. Opens it to...

            INT. PRIVATE OFFICE

            A bulked-out man at his desk... MILLS. Looks up as Jacket
            enters:

                                MILLS
                      Talk to me.

                                JACKET
                      Got nothin' to tell. Kiersey didn't call.  

                                MILLS
                      Try his office?

                                JACKET
                      'Ain't there. His home neither.

            Mills picks up the desk-phone. Dials...

                                MILLS
                          (into phone)
                      It's Mills. I need sweepers through Baton
                      Rouge. Find Daniel Kiersey.
                          (then to Jacket)
                      Keep pagin' him.

            EXT. DECATUR AVE + ESPLANADE - DUSK

            Jacket exits the Colonial and enters a corner CAFE. INSIDE,
            WE SEE Jacket move to a pay-phone and dial...

            INT. LOW-RENT HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

            ON KIERSEY'S PAGER, as it BUZZES again.

            REVEAL: BUD

            now seated at the window of this second-story room, using
            BINOCULARS to case the surrounding perimeter. 

                                BUD
                      C'mon. Show me somethin'.

            POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: as the night comes alive. Trucks pull
            to and from the alley. Patrons valet and enter Tibedaux's. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DUSK

            Braddock, walking down the hall with two POLICEMEN, unlocks a
            heavy door and enters...

            A HOLDING ROOM

            ...where Kiersey waits. Pale skin, beaded in sweat. Both
            hands in casts.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Mr. Kiersey. I'm Captain Mike Braddock.
                      How can I help you?

                                KIERSEY
                      Detective Bud Carter is out of control!

                                BRADDOCK
                          (corrects him)
                      Detective "Lieutenant." Now how can I
                      help you?

            Kiersey, a shaky breath.

                                KIERSEY
                      How long till you make an arrest in your
                      investigation of Lucian Adams?

            Braddock, just stares.

                                KIERSEY
                      I'm willing to provide you with documents
                      and information to secure his conviction.

                                BRADDOCK
                      Why?

                                KIERSEY
                      Why do you think? I'm afraid for my life.
                          (and the hammer)
                      I'll confirm whatever Jesse Wheeler's
                      given you.

                      Got a possible here.

            EXT. CAFE, DECATUR AVE - NIGHT

            The TOWN CAR passes slow... REVEAL NOW: MARANDINO, staked,
            having dinner outside the cafe. Crowded tables around him.

                                COBB V.O.
                          (radio filter)
                      Town Car. Black. Second time around.

            MOVING WITH THE TOWN CAR, as it turns onto ESPLANADE AVENUE
            and parks before the Colonial.

            REVEAL NOW: COBB, in a nondescript VAN. Parked a quarter
            block off Esplanade. He triggers photos through tinted glass.

            STILL PHOTOS CLICK -- the Town Car doors open. Two AB
            SOLDIERS step out. Bulges where their holsters are. Then a
            third man from in back: A boss, HAROLD KAY, 50s.

                                COBB

            I/E. COBB'S VAN - NIGHT

            Parked on Chartres Avenue. Covering the alley. With
            binoculars, he can SEE the high point of the Colonial. 

            And we see now, Bud has this place surrounded.

                                COBB
                          (as a light goes on, into
                           radio)
                      They're on the second floor.

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

            Bud grabs the phone. Dials...

                          (over phone)
                      It's Bud...

                                BRADDOCK
                      You better have something fuckin' good.

                                BUD
                      I'm in the French Quarter. Sittin' on AB
                      activity. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      Lucian?

                                BUD
                      Don't know yet. I got Harold Kay so far.

            Braddock looks to the AB ORGANIZATIONAL CHART on the wall.
            MUG SHOT of HAROLD KAY atop one branch of AB SOLDIERS.

                                BUD
                      Looks like they own the God damn block. 

                                BRADDOCK
                      Well I got Kiersey just walked in. Two
                      fractured wrists and scared as all hell.

                                BUD
                      I can explain--

                                BRADDOCK
                      He wants to make a deal, Bud. I can keep
                      Nokes in the dark twenty-four hours, but
                      that's it.

            Cobb's VOICE comes over the radio:

                                COBB V.O.
                          (radio filter)

                      Hold on, Mike.

            Bud cradles the phone, picks up the radio:

                          (into phone)
                      Mike, I've got Edgar Bingham now. Just
                      showed with two of his crew, for a sit
                      down with Kay.

            INTERCUT: BRADDOCK

                          (radio filter)
                      Marandino, they comin' your way.

            Marandino looks up from his table, to find this crew of men
            walking right for him. Marandino stares. A frozen moment... 

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

            Bud throws down his binoculars and takes up a .50 CALIBER
            BURROWS RIFLE, lays an eye on the SCOPE.

            BUD'S POV THROUGH THE SCOPE (MAGNIFIED): the cross-hairs find

            EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

            The crew of men getting closer now, a few yards away...

            Marandino - heart racing - slides his Browning 9MM out and
            slips it onto the table, below his napkin, aims...

            ...When the crew abruptly turns and enters the cafe.
            Marandino exhales relief...

                      They're inside.

            Bud sits back. Then: 

            KIERSEY'S PAGER BUZZES AGAIN. (The cafe number)

                                BUD
                          (grabs phone, to Braddock)
                      Mike, I need Kiersey to place a call.
                      Five minutes, or this opportunity's gone.

                          (into phone)
                      Give me the number...

            INT. CAFE - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

            Bingham, Kay and Mills at a booth, sipping coffee. Two
            Soldiers guard the front and back doors. 

            Mills looks at Jacket, who waits by the pay-phone. Both
            noticeably on edge. Finally --

            The PAY-PHONE RINGS.

                                MILLS
                          (to Kay + Bingham)
                      Excuse me.

            He gets up, walks toward the phone. When Jacket answers,
            Mills takes the receiver from him. 

                                MILLS
                          (into phone)

                      We've been pagin' you over two hours.
                      Where the fuck you been?

                                KIERSEY
                      I apologize. I've been tooth and nail
                      with the D.A., in court, all day.

                                MILLS V.O.
                      Everything good?

                                KIERSEY
                      Everything's fine. Just lay low. Regular
                      time tomorrow.   

            Mills hangs up.

            Kiersey turns. Pale. To Braddock: 

                                KIERSEY
                      Now get me protection.

            INT. CAFE - NIGHT

            Mills returns to the booth. Kay and Bingham look at him.

                                BINGHAM
                      So?

                                MILLS
                      All good. Let's eat.

            EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

            Marandino watches as Bingham, Kay and Mills pull their coats
            on and exit the cafe...

                      Entering Tibedaux's Tavern...

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S TAVERN - NIGHT

            A busy nightclub crowded wall-to-wall with PATRONS.

            FOLLOW Kay, Bingham and Mills, passing tables, greeting
            "connected" types... and through a far door into a back room. 

            EXT. CHARTRES + ESPLANADE - NIGHT

            FOLLOW Marandino as he walks down the street, knocks on the
            back of the Van. 

            INT. COBB'S VAN - NIGHT

            Cobb, now dressed in evening attire, throws open the door and
            Marandino climbs in. They exchange transmitter for headset
            and Cobb leaves the van for the street...

            EXT. TIBEDAUX'S - NIGHT

            Cobb approaches the front door, where a pair of large DOORMEN
            stand.

                                DOORMAN #1
                      Can we help you?

                                COBB
                      Just lookin' for a drink and a bite to
                      eat.

                                DOORMAN #1
                      Think you'll find what you're lookin' for
                      across the street.  
                          (gestures)
                      Try the cafe.

            Cobb stares at both Doormen #1 and #2, immovable forces. 

                                COBB
                      Alright. Thanks.

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

            BUD'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: Cobb leaves Tibedaux's and
            positions himself at an outdoor table in the cafe.

                      Negative at Tibedaux's. Can't walk in.
                      What's our move?

            EXT. STREETS - NIGHT TO LATE NIGHT - TIME LAPSE

            SHOTS OF COBB AND MARANDINO

            waiting. Patrons empty out. Cars drive away.

            SHOTS OF BUD

            INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

            POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Back of Tibedaux's. A BALCONY
            GUARD emerges with a rifle, posts.

                          (radio filter)

                      I've got a man on the south balcony.
                      Armed.

            The door below opens and a second GUARD steps out, posts.

                                MARANDINO
                          (into radio)
                      Second man at the door now. Street level.
                      Possibly armed.

            SUDDENLY HEADLIGHTS FLOOD MARANDINO'S REAR WINDSHIELD.
            Marandino ducks, a reflex action.

            EXT. DECATUR

            Lights from a CADILLAC and a GRAND MARQUIS appear and come
            down the street - past Cobb - SLOWLY. Blacked out windows...

            INT. COBB'S CAR

            POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD: as the cars turn into the alley...

                          (into radio)
                      A Cadillac and a Grand Marquis, just
                      pulled in the alley.

            ...and stop behind Tibedaux's. 

            Passenger doors of both cars open, two AB SOLDIERS emerge.
            They open the rear door of the Cadillac and shadow the man
            they're escorting: LUCIAN.

            Balcony Guard looks on as Door Guard allows Lucian and his
            Soldiers to enter the building.

                                MARANDINO
                          (tense, into radio)
                      Bud... we got Lucian Adams...

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT

            Bud, pulse building to a boil.

                      Two men flanking. Drivers have not left
                      the cars. Initial perps still on post.
                      Lucian's entering the building...

            Bud pulls on a KEVLAR VEST, holsters a .45. Extra clips on
            the waistband. Checks a loaded PUMP SG.

            Ready.

            INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Marandino, fastens on a vest, loads a 12-Gauge, locks.

            Suddenly, through the side window... A LONE FIGURE, IN A
            QUARTER TRENCH, MOVES PAST. It happens in a flash.

            Marandino LOOKS, SEES only a quick profile as the Figure cuts
            between parked cars and walks across the street... 

                                MARANDINO
                          (into radio)
                      I need eyes on a single, white male
                      crossing Esplanade. Possible intent...

            EXT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT

            Cobb looks over his shoulder, SEES the Figure 75 yards away,
            moving briskly across Esplanade...

            We still can't see his face.

            INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE NIGHT 

            Bud grabs the rifle, eye on the scope, aims out the window. 

            POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: as the CROSS-HAIRS find the Figure
            walking. SEE the BODY. Then the FACE... IT'S JESSE. 

            ON BUD, spinning now.

                          (quickly, radio filter)
                      He's heading toward the alley, Bud. We
                      take him down?

            BUD'S POV THROUGH THE SCOPE: THE CROSS-HAIRS FIXED ON JESSE'S
            HEAD - TRACKING - RACK FOCUS... This decision... He HAS to
            decide... And he does:

                                BUD
                      Let him go.

                                COBB V.O.
                      What?!

                      Bud, that's crazy! Jesse goes in first,
                      he's gonna blow this whole thing. We
                      can't let that happen.

                          (intense, into radio)
                      That's exactly what we're gonna do! We
                      got no way inside. Let Jesse go in hard
                      and draw fire. He pushes Lucian out to
                      us. Stand the fuck down. I'm on my way.

            Bud throws down the rifle, grabs the pump SG, runs out the
            door...

            INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

            Marandino, sweeps the alley with his binoculars. No Jesse.

            JESSE STRIDES INTO VIEW. Draws a silenced Tactical .45 and
            FIRES, putting TWO HARD ROUNDS into Door Guard. Both DRIVERS
            get out. Jesse pivots, HAMMERS two rounds to their heads.
            They drop cold. It happens in seconds.

            Jesse slaps a clay plastique with a DETONATOR onto Tibedaux's

            There's a loud EXPLOSION as the DOOR BLOWS OPEN.

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S 

            FOLLOW JESSE through billowing smoke, into...

            A LONG HALLWAY

            as he pulls a REMINGTON SAWED-OFF, slung on a strap, to his
            left hand, .45 to his right.

            Mid-hall, AB #6 looks over, freezes.  

            JESSE'S SHOTGUN ROARS, REVERBERATING DOWN THE HALL, AND TWO
            HOLES ARE BLOWN INTO AB #6.

            INT. BACK ROOM

            Lucian with Kay and Bingham. They HEAR the explosion.
            Exchange looks.

            INT. HALLWAY

            Jesse steps over the dead AB #6 without breaking stride.
            Comes to a door. Kicks it in... 

            INT. PAYROLL OFFICE

            ...And Mills FIRES a gun, burning Jesse's ear -- Blood pours
            down his neck -- and Jesse's Tactical FIRES.

            Mills is HIT IN THE THROAT. He falls into a chair. And his
            eyes - at the fierce face of death - are filled with Jesse,
            who FIRES TWO ROUNDS. One to the head. That fast.   

            INT. BACK ROOM

            Two AB SOLDIERS #7 and #8 hurry in. Lucian, Kay and Bingham
            stand up. 

                                AB #7
                      Let's go. We're gettin' you out of here.

            All three bosses draw GUNS. Lock and load. 

            INT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT

            Outside, the sound of gunfire is heard. Jacket turns to the
            BARKEEP. Alarmed:

                                JACKET
                      Give me that fuckin' shotgun!

            Barkeep lays a shotgun on the bar. Jacket reaches. When...

                          (boaring in, 9MM aimed)
                      POLICE! TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE GUN! STEP
                      FUCKIN' BACK!!

            Jacket looks at Cobb. Steps back. Hands in the air.

            EXT. MOTEL + STREET - SAME

            Bud bursts outside, full throttle. Shouts into the radio:

                                BUD
                      Jam the alley! No one goes in or out!

            EXT. STREET + ALLEYS AROUND TIBEDAUX'S - SAME

            Marandino hits the gas. TIRES SCREECH as he slides sideways
            and secures the mouth of the alley. Door kicks out. 12-gauge
            levels.

            EXT. FRONT OF TIBEDAUX'S + DECATUR AVE

            Doorman #1, HEARING the commotion turns...

            ...SEES INSIDE THE CAFE, Cobb cuffing Jacket and Barkeep.

            Doorman #1 draws a Para-Ordnance .45, FIRES. A VOLLEY OF
            SHOTS SLAM INTO THE CAFE.  

            Cobb can't make it through INCOMING FIRE and covers.
            Remaining PATRONS SCREAM, drop under tables.  

            Doorman #1 KEEPS FIRING, advancing towards the Cafe, when--
            BOOM! A SHOTGUN BLAST takes his head off -- REVEALING BUD --
            behind him, running toward Tibedaux's.  

            I/E. TIBEDAUX'S, DOWNSTAIRS

            PATRONS stampede for the door. Lucian, Bingham and Kay with
            AB #7 and #8 follow...

            OUTSIDE TO THE STREET

            ...and Bud is coming right for them.

            CLOSE ON LUCIAN. The shock of seeing Bud. 

            Lucian FIRES.

            Bud kneels and PUMPS SHOTS - hits AB #7 and #8 - killing them.

            Lucian, Kay, Bingham flee back inside.

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S, MAINTENANCE ROOM

            Jesse yanks off the cover of the main electric panel. He rips
            out incoming lines and FIRES into the lighting circuit. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

            VARIOUS ROOMS INSIDE TIBEDAUX'S

            Fluorescent units explode, plunging us into DARKNESS. Arcs
            SPUTTER and FLARE, the corridors now strobe-lit. 

            EXT. TIBEDAUX'S - SAME

            Cobb runs out of the cafe, pushing through civilians. 

                                COBB
                      Down! Get down!

            Bud pursues Lucian...

                      Stay on the door! I'm goin' in!

            INT. TIBEDAUX'S

            Bud enters-

            Split-second and DOORMAN #2 OPENS FIRE from the waiter's
            entrance.

            Bud drops and FIRES BACK. Doorman #2 goes down. Bud runs
            across overturned tables and up a STAIRWELL...

            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, TIBEDAUX'S

            Jesse emerges. AB #9 steps out, FIRES. The bullet hits
            Jesse's vest, knocking him backwards.

            Jesse levels the sawed-off. FIRES. AB #9 falls in a heap.
            Jesse rises, keeps moving...

            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS, ROOMS - TIBEDAUX'S

            MOVING WITH BUD entering, KICKING down doors, sweeping rooms
            with his shotgun... No sign of Lucian.

            INT. DOWNSTAIRS, BACK ROOMS

            Jesse is coming... 

            ...and the SLAUGHTER BUILDS. 

            He throws open a door to a BAR AREA.  

            AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse
            UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles.

            A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops
            to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE
            REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar.

            HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic
            wildly. Bottles and glasses explode.

            Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER.

            BEHIND THE BAR

            bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the
            .45. Above him, strays catch lights, glass filaments EXPLODE. 

            INT. UPSTAIRS, HALLWAYS + ROOMS

            Bud KICKS down a door. AB #12 charges out. Grabs for Bud...
            who breaks the grab, pulls AB #12's neck down, slams his knee
            into his forehead twice, knocked cold. Grabs his gun.    

            A HALLWAY DOOR SWINGS OPEN

            AB #13 emerges, HAMMERING GUNSHOTS. Bud covers. SHOTS BLOW
            HOLES in the wall.

            A SECOND DOOR OPENS

            ...and AB #14 steps out, draws. Bud throws him in the way of
            CROSS-FIRE. AB #13 takes AB #14's SHOTS. 

            Bud aims past. FIRES ONCE.

            AB #14 is hit dead center and drops like an oak.

            Both men dead. That fast, and Bud is on the move... 

            EXT. ALLEY, TIBEDAUX'S - CONTINUOUS

            AB #10 and #11 run out and swing their SMGs, FIRING onto the
            alley and KILLING MARANDINO... Then charging to the front--

            COBB FIRES. AB #10 is BLOWN APART, as AB #11 FIRES back,
            hitting Cobb in the vest. His ribs broken, he sits down
            stunned.

                                COBB 
                          (into radio)
                      I'm hit. I'm fuckin' hit.

            AB #11 running past as several BLACK AND WHITES now arrive.
            TAKE AND RETURN FIRE -- AB #11 is shot dead.

            Police shouting. Civilians running, as...

            INT. BACK BAR AREA, DOWNSTAIRS

            GUNFIGHT ENSUES. 

            Jesse rises over the bar, FIRING BURSTS into Kay, who tumbles
            down the stairwell like a rag doll. 

            Bingham shoots Jesse in the hip. He staggers, then falls and
            rolls to his back... 

            Bingham rounds the bar just as Jesse, somehow, lifts the .45
            and FIRES two slugs into Bingham's chest.

            Bingham collapses on top of Jesse. The .45 hits the floor.
            Both men, bleeding profusely, thrash along the floor...

            INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

            Bud, racing toward a stairwell, LEAPS down a flight, turns,
            and RUNS down another. 

            INT. BACK BAR AREA

            Jesse, trapped under the heavy Bingham, pulls the buck knife
            from his holster and sinks it into Bingham's kidney. TWISTS.
            Blood POOLS. Bingham MOANS...

            ...Jesse rolls the big man over, hoists himself high and
            impales Bingham through the throat. Dead.

            Jesse exhales, struggles up...rising to his feet...

            BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT

            out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING
            NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD...

            ...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING.

            Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly...

            IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS
            INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR. 

            Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the
            trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF,
            BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS
            FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.

            Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to
            break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over
            against Lucian's face.

            Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right.

            Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head.
            Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. 

            Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum.

            Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes
            down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and
            Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves.

            Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table.
            IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on
            Lucian with furious blows that come one after another.

            Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian
            by the throat and presses down.

            Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face,
            tearing skin. 

            Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him.

            Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at
            Bud's fingers, trying to pull away...

            Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the
            last moment, the cop in him reemerges...

            Bud lets go.

            Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of
            blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints.

            Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on
            the floor...And he slows...

            Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face.
            Only the dark pool of blood around him.

            Lucian passes out.

                                BUD
                          (into radio)
                      I got him... I got Lucian.

            SLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE...

            ...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up
            the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the
            street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and
            emergency vehicles... 

            ...to where life goes on in New Orleans.

                                                           DIP TO BLACK.

            FADE IN:

            EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAYS LATER

            The sun is out. The sky above is clear.

            INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

            ON BUD, as he leads Lucian through the bowels of city lock-up. 

            Lucian - in prison garbs, haggard, dark bruises - looks up as
            they pass a two-way mirror of an INTERROGATION ROOM, SEES...

            KIERSEY

            ...seated, making statements to Shepard, who is taking notes.
            Stacks of Jesse's reports surround them.

            Bud walks Lucian past, into...

            INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2

            ...and Lucian sits at a table. Bud across from him. Silence
            hangs, several moments. 

            ON BUD                                                             

            starting again, knowing... There's something bigger. A slow
            smile spreads...

                                BUD
                      Want a cup of coffee?

                                               October 20, 1986








     FADE IN:

     EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

     The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.

     The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, 
     dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and 
     concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its 
     aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
     kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready 
     to burst.

     EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic 
     anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- 
     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.

     On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from 
     their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch 
     over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the 
     Gotham night.

     One of them is moving.

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

     The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of 
     big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. 
     Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
     fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
     each other... with one conspicuous exception:

     A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring 
     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the 
     main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks 
     over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and 
     now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in 
     the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

                              MOM
               For God's sake, Harold, can we
               please just get a taxi??

                              DAD
               I'm trying to get a --
                     (shouting)
               TAXI!!

     Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in 
     frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.

                              JIMMY
               We're going the wrong way.

     Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys 
     them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.

                              DAD
               Put that away. We'll look like
               tourists.

     TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night 
     souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. 
     The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks 
     him off down the street and glowers at DAD.

                              DAD (cont.)
               We'll never get a cab here. Let's
               cut over to Seventh.

                              JIMMY
               Seventh is that way.

                              DAD
               I know where we are!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of 
     stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath 
     and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.

                              VOICE
               Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

     The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, 
     acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm 
     uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'

     MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then 
     move on -- pretending not to hear.

                              DERELICT
               Mister. How about it. One dollar?
                     (standing up)
               One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
               Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
               English??

     By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. 
     Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.

     They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE 
     in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand 
     brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.

     DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick 
     wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across 
     the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's 
     already searching for DAD's wallet.

     MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to 
     snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his 
     gun on JIMMY.

                              STREET PUNK
               Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
               scream.

     The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her 
     face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to 
     shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.

     The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, 
     slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down 
     on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

                              NICK
                     (emptying the wallet)
               All right. The Gold Card.
                     (tossing the credit card
                     in EDDIE's face)
               Don't leave home without it.

     A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the 
     cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct 
     CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

                              EDDIE
               Let's beat it, man. I don't like
               being up here.

                              NICK
               What, scared of heights?

                              EDDIE
               I dunno, man. After what happened to
               Johnny Gobs --

                              NICK
               Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
               walked off a roof, all right? No big
               loss.

                              EDDIE
               That ain't what I heard. That ain't
               what I heard at all.
                     (beat)
               I heard the bat got him.

                              NICK
               Gimme a break, will you? Shut up... 

                              EDDIE
               Five stories, straight down. There
               was no blood in the body.

                              NICK
               No shit. It was all over the
               pavement.

     NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the 
     roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight 
     tingle at the base of his spine... 

                              EDDIE
               There was no blood, man.
                     (beat)
               My brother says... all the bad things
               you done... they come back and
               haunt you... 

                              NICK
               Listen to this. How old are you?
               There ain't no bat.

                              EDDIE
               My brother's a priest, man.

                              NICK
               No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
               Now shut up.
                     (conclusively)
               There ain't no bat.

     As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the 
     opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away... 
     where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is 
     dropping slowly, implacably, into frame... 

                              EDDIE
               You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
               that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

                              NICK
               Do you want this money or don't
               you? Now shut up! Shut up --

     BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of 
     BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS 
     DROP.

     Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a 
     BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.

     EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his 
     throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK 
     FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS: 
     GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.

     NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.

     And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate, 
     menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval 
     yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... 

     NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure 
     is knocked bodily to the roof.

     Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He 
     whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --

                              NICK (cont.)
               I'm gettin' outta here.

     -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a 
     strange, pre-verbal squeal... 

     ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, 
     NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

     Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters 
     out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of 
     the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches 
     for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to 
     the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.

     EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face 
     drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes 
     out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --

     -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --

     -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a 
     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, 
     weightless puppet.

     THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES 
     NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES 
     past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... 

     A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches 
     forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming 
     now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming 
     figure of the BAT at his heels... 

     ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against 
     the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He 
     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.

     Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he 
     could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling 
     on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to 
     pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails... 

     THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with 
     supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.

                              NICK (cont.)
               Don't kill me... don't kill me... 

     When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is 
     standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at 
     arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.

     The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:

                              BATMAN
               I won't kill you. I want you to do
               me a favor.

     NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

     He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where 
     BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own 
     stricken face.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Tell your friends. Tell all your
               friends.

     NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves 
     him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, 
     without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE 
     ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.

     Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over... 
     finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

     NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow 
     globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

     An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM. 
     HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find 
     the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT, 
     addressing a crowd from behind his podium.

                              DENT
               ... it is no longer enough to go
               after the small-time punks and petty
               criminals who infest the streets of
               Gotham City. Crime and corruption
               must be attacked at the root!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. 
     They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled 
     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're 
     going to enjoy this.

     Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling 
     water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- 
     the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has 
     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.

     The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.

     ANGLE ON DENT

                              DENT
               If elected, my first act as district
               attorney will be to return an
               indictment against Boss Carl
               Grissom!

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. 
     Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place 
     reeks of money.

     In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.
     Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle 
     with extraordinary finesse.

     In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, 
     with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.

                              DENT
                     (on the TV screen)
               Together we can make Gotham city a
               safe place for decent people to live
               and work and play.

     THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, 
     turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck 
     sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the 
     middle.

                              JACK NAPIER
               Decent people shouldn't live here.
               They'd be much happier someplace
               else.

     JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to 
     Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost 
     feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his 
     appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.

     He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA 
     HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides 
     over in her negligee and snuggles up.

                              ALICIA
               Anything new?

                              JACK
               The usual gas. If this clown could
               lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
               had to kill him by now.

     ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She 
     begins knotting it playfully about his neck.

                              ALICIA
               If Grissom knew about us... he
               might kill you.

     JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts 
     back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a 
     nearby vanity.

                              JACK
               Don't think so, angel. I'm too
               valuable. That's the way I've
               planned it.
                     (pause)
               And besides, he doesn't know.

     JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands 
     in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted 
     hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.

                              ALICIA
               You look just fine, Jack.

     He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

                              JACK
               ... I didn't ask.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham 
     Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of 
     activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

     EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. 
     Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE 
     MEDIC.

                              MEDIC
               That one there won't say a word. The
               other one's raving his head off.

                              ECKHARDT
               Variety, huh? The spice of life.

     At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
     thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
     Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
     PATROLMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               They found him hugging a drainpipe.
               He was scared to come off the roof.

                              KNOX
               Great, but tell me: is this another
               you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
               the third one this week.

                              PATROLMAN
                     (testily)
               I dunno. What's "what"?

                              KNOX
               Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
               for a commendation.

     KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and 
     saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.

                              ECKHARDT
               Oh Christ, it's Knox.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, gents. This anything I should
               know about?

                              ECKHARDT
               Nothing out of the routine.

     At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
     fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.

                              NICK
               A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
               He wanted me to do him a favor...!

     KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade 
     disgusted looks.

                              KNOX
               No offense, boys, but these guys are
               seeing something up there.

                              ECKHARDT
               No comment. Print what you like.

                              KNOX
               Come on. One question. Is there a
               six-foot bat in Gotham City?

     KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts 
     in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:

                              KNOX (cont.)
               If so, is he on the police payroll?
               If so, what's he pulling down after
               taxes?

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. 
     He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling 
     across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the 
     dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.

     ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. 
     He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the 
     block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered 
     up alongside him.

     ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it 
     quickly in his coat.

                              JACK
               You didn't show up.

                              ECKHARDT
               We had another bat sighting.

                              JACK
               I'm sure that was vitally important.
               Listen: things are heating up.
               Someone is leaking information to
               Harvey Dent.

     ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
               problem --

                              JACK
               Eckhardt... our problems are your
               problems.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'll work on it.

     JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his 
     topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the 
     material between his fingers.

                              JACK
               Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
               ostentatious on a cop's salary,
               don't you think?

                              ECKHARDT
                     (knocking his hands away)
               I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
               you.

                              JACK
               You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
               should be thinking about the future.

     ECKHARDT laughs in his face.

                              ECKHARDT
               Ambition.
                     (nodding his head)
               Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
               that organization.

                              JACK
               And why's that?

                              ECKHARDT
               You're a psycho, friend. You're an
               A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
               it.

     JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The 
     fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.

     JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back 
     full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an 
     all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

     By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. 
     ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.

                              JACK
               Here. Use mine.

     JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in 
     ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT 
     to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the 
     stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.

     ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one 
     crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.

                              JACK (cont.)
               It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
               here is a good cop. A real good cop.
                     (pause; smiling)
               Inexpensive.

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and 
     fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. 
     ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his 
     hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.

                              KNOX
               What have you got for me, Jerry?

     JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, 
     fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption 
     at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in 
     approval.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
               on the fangs, huh?

     He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED 
     COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:

                              COLLEAGUE
               Hey Knox, you got a visitor.

                              KNOX
               I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
               dust him, okay?

                              COLLEAGUE
               This one you might want to dust
               yourself.

     Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops 
     in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. 
     The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a 
     WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, 
     her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.

                              KNOX
               ... Vicki Vale.

     The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock 
     of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls 
     KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.

                              VICKI
               How'd you know it was me?

                              KNOX
               Honey -- I would know any randomly
               selected square inch of Vicki
               Vale.
                     (grinning)
               If I had a good enough hint.

     He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears 
     the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Where the hell have you been?

                              VICKI
               A nice, restful vacation.

     She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of 
     glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn 
     corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.

                              KNOX
               God, a girl could get hurt doing
               this.

                              VICKI
               I do get hurt.

     She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long 
     fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then 
     points to the scar and adds, slyly:

                              KNOX
               Got any more of those?

                              VICKI
               Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
               here. What's new and hot in Gotham
               City?

                              KNOX
               It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
               foot bat that swoops out of the
               night and preys on evildoers.

                              VICKI
                     (laughing)
               Evildoers, huh? Big or small?

                              KNOX
               Small so far. I mean -- they don't
               allow bats in boardrooms, do they.

                              VICKI
               Speaking of which... I hear the
               notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
               big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
               law'n'order freak in the city's
               gonna be there.

     KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI 
     may have a purpose in all this.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --

     She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an 
     INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
                     (apprehensively)
               Got a date?

     She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. 
     KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, 
     nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
               loved you. Will you marry me?

                              VICKI
                     (straightening her clothes)
               No.

                              KNOX
               Well, I'm starving. Will you at
               least buy me a hamburger?

                              VICKI
               Yes, but please -- be gentle.

     Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

     A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. 
     This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power 
     perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City 
     rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.

     GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS 
     -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types 
     and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this 
     makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the 
     Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.

                              GRISSOM
               Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
               don't like the way this is shaping
               up.

     JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's 
     right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.

                              JACK
               We can always pop him. -- Or pop
               someone close to him.

                              LIEUTENANT
               Let's feed him to the bat.

     This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the 
     crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.

                              GRISSOM
               He's going after our front
               companies. Specifically Ace
               Chemical. Which would tie us
               in with Councilman Kane, Senator
               Miller... on up the line.
                     (pause)
               We have to clean out our files
               before the subpoena comes down.

                              LIEUTENANT
               How do we go? The usual fire?

                              GRISSOM
               I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
               office, remove the relevant
               documents... 

                              JACK
               "Industrial espionage."

                              GRISSOM
               That's right. And Jack --
                     (pause)
               I'd like you to handle this
               operation personally.

     JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the 
     deck. His hand freezes in midair.

                              JACK
               ... Me?

     At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA 
     HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. 
     She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.

                              GRISSOM
               Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
               mind waiting in the other room.

     ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side 
     door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.

                              JACK
               Why do you need me to handle a
               simple break-in?

                              GRISSOM
                     (emphatically)
               Because I want someone I can
               trust.

     JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the 
     fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.

     It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre 
     HOLE through its face.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               We'll work out the details later.
               But it's got to be soon. -- All
               right, that's all for now.

     GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers 
     behind a moment.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
               important job. I can't trust it to
               somebody who'll screw up.

                              JACK
               I understand.

                              GRISSOM
                     (smiling)
               Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.

     JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the 
     big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               My friend, your luck is just about
               to change.

     He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway 
     nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles 
     coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
     hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a 
     team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind, 
     not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor; 
     the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, 
     blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's 
     power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money 
     into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.

     DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies, 
     telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another 
     group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots 
     and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a 
     corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands 
     ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.

     A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of 
     champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.

                              KNOX
               How high up would you say that is?

                              ALFRED
               I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

                              KNOX
               You know, if you cut your bathroom
               in half, you'd have my apartment.

                              ALFRED
               Which bathroom is that, air?

                              KNOX
               The small one.

     KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later, 
     VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers 
     and hooks up with KNOX.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
               actually know all these people?

                              VICKI
               Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
                     (pause)
               I'm quoting.

     KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.

                              KNOX
               Yeah, I guess we move in different
               circles. -- Though I did meet a
               one-eyed pimp last week.

     ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

     Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent 
     in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into 
     his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.

     Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and 
     VICKI wander up alongside him.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner Gordon! What do you
               hear from our pointy-eared friend?

     KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his 
     fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.

                              GORDON
               Knox, for the ninth time, and you
               can quote me -- there is no bat.

                              KNOX
               Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
               one honest cop in Gotham city.

     HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a 
     friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.

                              DENT
               How's your luck, Jim?

                              KNOX
               Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
               winged vigilantes?

     DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.

                              DENT
               Mr. Knox, I think we have enough
               real problems in this city without
               worrying about ghosts and goblins
               and Halloween characters.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."  
     From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping 
     TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously 
     applying BLACK CAMOUFLAGE PAINT to his face. He could be 
     getting ready for a date.

     The van is parked outside a chain-link fence which 
     surrounds the Ace Chemical complex.

     JACK'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

     The SECURITY GUARD in a glass booth at the entrance to the 
     parking lot. ONE OF JACK'S BOYS creeps up behind the booth 
     and takes the GUARD out.

     INT. VAN - ON JACK

     He turns the key in the ignition, shifts into first.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     KNOX and VICKI are taking an unauthorized tour of BRUCE's 
     house, wandering through rooms decorated in wildly 
     divergent motifs, eyeing an astounding collection of 
     artworks and antiques from every corner of the world.

                              KNOX
               My question is, where does one man
               get all this junk.

                              VICKI
               All over the world. They say he
               spends most of the year overseas --
               until recently, anyway.

                              KNOX
               Holy shit... 

     KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... We found the arsenal.

     One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound 
     volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds. 
     Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords... 
     every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever 
     devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               This guy has just gotten
               interesting. What else do you know?

                              VICKI
               Just what I've heard. Rich.
               Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.

                              KNOX
               Likes to kill?

                              VICKI
                     (smiling)
               Women find him magnetic.

                              KNOX
               I bet they like him for his big
               charity balls.

                              VICKI
               That, and the sweet smell of two
               hundred million bucks.

                              KNOX
               Well, you know me. The more they've
               got, the less they're worth.
                     (scanning the room)
               This guy must be the most worthless
               man in America.

     Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.

                              BRUCE WAYNE
               You disappoint me. Why not the
               world?

     KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face 
     of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... 
     and intensely handsome.

                              KNOX
               I assume in my usual charming manner
               I've just insulted the host.
                     (extending a hand)
               Alexander Knox.

                              BRUCE
               Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
               I quite like it.

                              KNOX
               Great. Give me a grant.

                              BRUCE
               I might consider it if you introduce
               me to Miss Vale.

     KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she 
     is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:

                              KNOX
               "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
               redundant.

                              BRUCE
                     (to VICKI)
               You're just back from Corto Maltese.
               I saw your combat photos. Quite a
               departure for you.

                              VICKI
               That's intriguing. They haven't been
               published yet.

     BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.

                              BRUCE
               ... You have an extraordinary eye.

     He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial 
     instincts aroused, pipes up:

                              KNOX
               Some people think she has two.

     VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:

                              VICKI
               Don't mind my friend. He's a little
               nervous tonight.

     KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his 
     competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's 
     something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
     could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's 
     almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation 
     of charm.

     This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
     like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm 
     turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:

                              VICKI (cont.)
               This is an amazing house. I'd love
               to shoot it sometime.

                              BRUCE
               I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
               you be staying in Gotham for a
               while?

                              VICKI
               As far as I know.

                              BRUCE
               Good. Then with any luck we'll run
               into each other.

     Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind 
     them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.

                              ALFRED
               Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
               was compelled to leave -- very
               unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
               his regrets.

                              BRUCE
               Thank you, Alfred.
                     (to VICKI)
               I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
               great pleasure meeting you.
                     (to KNOX)
               And you.

     Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and 
     strides hurriedly out of the room.

                              KNOX
               I know the rich are different, but
               that guy is real different.

     VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Hello? Vicki?

                              VICKI
               Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.

                              KNOX
               What were you thinking?

                              VICKI
               Yum, yum.

                              KNOX
               Well, he must like the way he
               looks. He's got a mirror in every
               room.

     And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous 
     WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to 
     ceiling.

                              VICKI
               I get it. Bruce Vain.

     She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we

                                                 CUT TO:

     REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR

     looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- 
     as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording 
     everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, 
     state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

     showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
     reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a 
     whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control 
     center, we can see everything that's happening in the 
     house.

     Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward, 
     with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.

     At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
               Chemical Company.

                              GORDON
                     (obviously agitated)
               Good Lord, it we could put our hands
               on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
               about this? Who's in charge of
               the --

                              PATROLMAN
               Lt. Eckhardt, sir.

                              GORDON
               Eckhardt. Oh my God... 

     And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat. 
     The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights 
     off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing 
     out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.

     The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.

                              ECKHARDT
               Shoot to kill.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a 
     blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are 
     at work on the filing cabinets.

     The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal 
     door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:

                              SAFECRACKER
               ... Empty.

                              HOOD I
               Just like the file cabinets.

                              HOOD II
               I don't get it. If this place is
               cleaned out already, what do we need
               five men?

     JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny. 
     By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.

     Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares 
     outside.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT

     ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE 
     BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED 
     COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM. 
     ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.

                              ECKHARDT
               What are you trying to do, blow the
               collar?

                              GORDON
                     (to SWAT TEAM)
               You men are dismissed. We'll take
               over from here.
                     (to UNIFORMED COPS)
               Any man who opens fire on Jack
               Napier... will answer to me.

     ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               You. Stick around.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

     JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two 
     stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network 
     of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.

     Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.

                              COP
               Freeze!

     One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his 
     colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear 
     exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.

     ANGLE ON GORDON

     standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building 
     and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING 
     OUT as the HOODS scatter.

                              ECKHARDT
                     (snidely)
               Nice work, Commissioner.

                              GORDON
               I'm in charge here. Not Carl
               Grissom.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when 
     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant 
     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its 
     massive chest. BATMAN.

     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in 
     the opposite direction.

     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across 
     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a 
     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL 
     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, 
     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts 
     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS 
     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES 
     -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he 
     throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES 
     SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of 
     plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place 
     over giant basins.

     JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine 
     to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.

     ANGLE ON CATWALKS

     BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated 
     walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them 
     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.

     BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED 
     HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS 
     HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.

     HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his 
     ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. 
     A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.

     HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a 
     miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... 
     planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.

     ANGLE ON COPS

     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.

                              COP
               LOOK!

                              GORDON
               My God... it's him.

     ANGLE ON CATWALK

     HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. 
     BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III 
     with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.

     He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once 
     through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.

     Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the 
     HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB 
     UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE 
     STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK 
     to the factory floor forty feet below!

     INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

     JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; 
     STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking 
     lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting 
     for JACK to make his move.

     No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team 
     -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind 
     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.

     INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

     JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the 
     metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out 
     onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... 
     begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.

     COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last 
     pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.

     AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.

     INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

     COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses 
     out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN 
     FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.

     JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The 
     cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, 
     hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE 
     begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate 
     opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!

     Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If 
     JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting 
     shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to 
     his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.

     JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he 
     does --

     BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! 
     His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in 
     diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The 
     plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.

     An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm 
     around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED 
     STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... 

                              VOICE
               HOLD IT!

     In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind 
     the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

                              HOOD V
               Let him go or I'll do it.

     BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to 
     himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he 
     strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the 
     back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.

     All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. 
     HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he 
     waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.

     ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his 
     side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the 
     Commissioner plugged.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. 
     He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a 
     supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling 
     black currents of the East River... and freedom.

     He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 
     AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor 
     of the catwalk mere yards away.

     ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

     The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the 
     Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.

                              HOOD V
               Nobody makes a move. We go out
               clean.

                              JACK'S VOICE
               ECKHARDT!!

     ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands 
     poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops 
     ECKHARDT cleanly.

     The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a 
     NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at 
     the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- 
     a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.

     The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, 
     DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.

     AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. 
     JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. 
     BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

     JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

     A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized 
     pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.

                              GORDON
               NO!!

     But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, 
     totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The 
     COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN 
     into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING 
     ALL THE WAY.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Goddammit, we had him. We --

     And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention 
     focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle 
     warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS 
     ON HIS BELT.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Hold it right there, Mister.

     THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then 
     -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto 
     the factory floor.

     A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild 
     pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily 
     dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN 
     from view.

     A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling 
     cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.

                              COP
               LOOK!

     The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too 
     late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF 
     THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an 
     avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy 
     heights, safely out of range.

                              GORDON
               HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                              COP
               ... Who is this guy?

                              GORDON
               I don't know, but he's one hell of a
               showman.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the 
     illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the 
     chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky 
     deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the 
     oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

     As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck 
     swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER 
     -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

     A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we

                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe: "BAT 
     MAN FOILS ROBBERY. WHO IS MASKED VIGILANTE?"

     Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a 
     jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
               Don't tell me some lie you'll have
               to retract later.

     CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking 
     up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
               is getting ambitious. -- Why the
               dopey grin?

                              VICKI
               Guess who's got a date with Bruce
               Wayne.

                              KNOX
               Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
               and asked you for a date?... Shit.
                     (shouting)
               HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
                     (to VICKI)
               I want you to pay close attention to
               this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
               what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

     A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ, 
     60, is the society editor of the Globe.

                              MIRANDA
               You mean Mister One-Nighter?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
                     (to VICKI)
               Because that's the average length of
               his relationships with women.

                              MIRANDA
               The current record is almost two
               weeks. That cover girl -- what's her
               name? You must've shot her, Vicki --

                              KNOX
               Tell her about the peanuts.

                              VICKI
               Peanuts?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes
               through women.

                              MIRANDA
               Like Planter's Peanuts.

     VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.

                              VICKI
               Plain or roasted?
                     (standing up)
               Alex, I'm very flattered that you've
               gone out and done all this research.

                              KNOX
               Why?
                     (blushing suddenly)
               Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter.
               I'm curious. I do this for a living.
               -- What'd you tell him?

                              VICKI
               I told him yes.

     KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes 
     KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               You're awfully sweet to be
               concerned, but it's really not
               necessary. I'll call you, okay?

     She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.

                              KNOX
               ... What was that?

                              MIRANDA
               That was one of the most gracious
               fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure
               to watch. -- What a nice girl.

     KNOX, totally flustered, sighs and sinks into his chair.

                              KNOX
               Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. COASTLINE - DAY

     A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance, 
     closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.

     EXT. DECK - YACHT - DAY

     BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE 
     FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs, 
     soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.

                              VICKI
               Do you sail?

                              BRUCE
               Too much work. I'm not really the
               physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.

     ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of 
     drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches 
     for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin 
     over braided telephone cables.

                              VICKI
               You do a very convincing imitation.
                     (sipping her drink)
               Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?

     He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for 
     her to try a sip.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Ginger ale?

                              BRUCE
               Two drinks and I start swinging from
               the rooftops.
                     (beat)
               Tell me, Vicki. There's something
               I'm very curious about. What took
               you down to Corto Maltese?

                              VICKI
               ... I guess I needed a change.

                              BRUCE
               You were one of the most successful
               magazine photographers in the city.
               Everyone wanted you.

                              VICKI
               Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?

                              BRUCE
               Not since the shooting started.

                              VICKI
               We went there once when I was
               little. I played on the beach. And
               at nights -- they had a band -- I
               danced with my father on the hotel
               patio.
                     (shrugging)
               That was Corto Maltese. When the war
               broke out I had to go back. And I
               promised myself that this time... I
               wouldn't look away.

                              BRUCE
               What did you see?

                              VICKI
               ... Terror.

     The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. 
     VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.

                              BRUCE
               There's terror everywhere. Some
               types are just more -- familiar
               than others.

     For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his 
     familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
               know it all seems a million miles
               away, out here on the water, with
               all this --

                              BRUCE
               Insulation?

     VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she 
     can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.

                              VICKI
               Bruce, really, when I say these
               things I don't mean to criticize
               you.

                              BRUCE
               I think you see things very clearly.

                              VICKI
               I'm happy to talk about something
               else. I don't want to be depressing.

                              BRUCE
                     (smiling)
               Do you assume that if I know you
               better I won't like you as much?

     VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but 
     if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
               you like this with the other women
               you know? -- Because I just can't
               seem to get a handle on this
               conversation.

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
               ambiguous, I think you should put
               the most flattering possible
               interpretation on it. Because even
               if it doesn't sound that way... 
               that's how I'll mean it.

     Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's 
     also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before 
     she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

     Rigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big 
     crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile."

     WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in 
     the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although 
     most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA 
     #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above 
     the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.

     She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some 
     rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing 
     a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box.

     DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has 
     her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box.

     HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX

     BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and 
     whispers back.

     A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But 
     her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera 
     glasses SNAP SHUT.

     ANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3

     staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of 
     TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a 
     chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up.

                              VICKI
               -- but it's not fair. I'm half
               drunk and you're not even --

                              BRUCE
               Would you like me to take you home?

                              VICKI
               God. You would.
                     (sidling up to him)
               Come on, Bruce. I just want to get
               two drinks in you. As an
               experiment.

                              BRUCE
               Maybe we should just kiss.

                              VICKI
               ... We could try that.

     WIDER ANGLE

     BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry 
     hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite 
     walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to:

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole 
     near the Gotham docks.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect 
     in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of 
     an unlicensed gangland doctor.

     The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner 
     of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.

                              DOCTOR
               Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we
               did.

     He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:

     JACK NAPIER'S POV

     The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands 
     there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His 
     eyes bug out. He GAGS.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
     still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     ANGLE ON DOCTOR

     He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand 
     mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats. 
     Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to 
     the floor.

     JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.

                              DOCTOR
               You understand the facial muscles
               were completely severed --

     JACK keeps on laughing.

     The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at 
     his seedy equipment.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               -- you can see what I have to work
               with here --

     MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with 
     one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               I'm sure that with proper recon--
               recon-- reconstructive surgery --

     A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a 
     sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table.

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT

     From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the 
     alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head. 
     We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is 
     BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling.

     It's almost as though BRUCE is not used to sleeping at 
     night. He doesn't know what to do with himself.

     He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all 
     that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really 
     rather be somewhere else.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club 
     as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.

                              KID
                    Nice hair, dude!

     JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he 
     gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER -- 
     and strides deliberately across the street.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

     The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-
     glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the 
     private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in 
     the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.

                              GRISSOM (O.S.)
               That you, sugar bumps?

     GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. 
     He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his 
     impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his 
     hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up 
     figure at his desk.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Who the hell are you?

                              JACK
               It's me. "Sugar Bumps."

                              GRISSOM
                     (recognizing his voice)
               Jack?
                     (advancing cautiously)
               Thank God. I can't believe it's you.
               I heard you'd been --

                              JACK
                     (standing up)
               Is that what you "heard"?

     JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't 
     move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.

                              JACK (cont.)
               YOU SET ME UP!
                     (beat)
               Over a girl. You must be insane!

     GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

                              JACK (cont.)
               Keep your hands on the desk.

                              GRISSOM
               Sooner or later you would've tried
               to take me, Jack. You may get me
               now, but your life won't be worth a
               dime.

                              JACK
               I've died once already. It wasn't so
               bad. -- In fact I recommend it.

     GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK 
     is utterly, hopelessly deranged.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

                              JACK
               JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK??

     And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS 
     THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock 
     -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.

     His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous 
     seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from 
     the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, 
     PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

                              JACK (cont.)
               I'm not a Jack any more.
                     (pause; cackling)
               You made me a Joker!

     THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. 
     GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the 
     desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT
               LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

                              JACK
               HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

     And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires 
     again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.

     EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, 
     arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW 
     spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from 
     this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel 
     chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.

                              JOKER
               What a view. Our little city. It
               always brings a smile to my face.

     He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at 
     GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still 
     wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Guess it's my little city now.
               Wonder what it'll look like when I
               get done with it.
                     (pause)
               I bet it'll be something real fine.
               Real fine and pretty.

                                                 DISSOLVE T0:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A 
     SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent 
     bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."

     She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow 
     she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.

     INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING

     BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to 
     himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He 
     instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.

                              VICKI
               I didn't mean to scare you. I just
               had to come in here and see it that
               was really you singing.

     She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if 
     she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
                     (singing)
               "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to
               touch my cup." Come on. "You're my
               sugar --"
                     (no response from BRUCE)
               Bruce, you are such a case.

     BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly 
     recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost 
     childish smile.

                              BRUCE
               I don't sing very well.

                              VICKI
               Then there's one thing in the world
               you don't do very well. And I know
               what it is. -- Now you'll have to
               kill me.

     He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a 
     towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               Poor thing. You should stay off that
               horse.

     INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the 
     Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and 
     there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. 
     It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.

                              KNOX
                     (disgusted)
               ...Peanut.

     A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:

                              COPY BOY
               Here's that morgue file you wanted.

     KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE 
     WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf 
     through old clippings from back issues of the Globe.

     WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE 
     HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE 
     VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in 
     dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell 
     a rich philanthropist can be.

                              KNOX
               Come on. Gimme some dirt!

     Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of 
     clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two 
     partial exceptions.

     One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the 
     camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an 
     ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair 
     down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN 
     1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... Why don't you like your picture
               taken?

                                                   CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT

     A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's 
     apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the 
     glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, 
     peering inside, hesitant to enter.

     As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, 
     tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's 
     almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her.

                              DOORMAN
               Miss Hunt!
                     (smiling)
               No need to sneak in. The rent's been
               taken care of.

                              ALICIA
               ... The rent? Paid?

     INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ALICIA, mystified, lets herself in and turns to lock the 
     door. She's startled once more by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

                              VOICE
               Honey -- I'm home!

     She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

     Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on 
     his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket 
     and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.

     This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a 
     dead faint.

     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY

     It looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. At a 
     long table sit Gotham's most distinguished criminals: 
     GANGLORDS and RACKETS BOSSES from every corner of the city. 
     They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.

                              JOKER (O.S.)
               So that's how it is, gents. Until
               Grissom decides it's safe to come up
               for air... I'm running the show.

     Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather 
     flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with 
     flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.

     Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.

                              GANG BOSS
               So why don't we hear this from
               Grissom?

                              RACKETEER
               I got something I'd like to know.
               How come you're wearing that stupid
               smirk?

                              JOKER
               'Cause I got an army, chum. And I
               got Grissom's army. And this city
               is mine.

     CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:

                              ROTELLI
               I don't like taking orders, from
               Grissom. And I especially don't like
               taking orders from Grissom's goon.

                              JOKER
               I've considered that possibility.

                              ROTELLI
               And what happens if we say no?

                              JOKER
                     (chuckling)
               Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we
               can't do business, we shake hands
               and part friends.

                              ROTELLI
               That's it?

                              JOKER
               That's it.

     THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it. 
     He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's 
     palm.

     40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back 
     into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his 
     sleeves and shirt collar.

     The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a 
     move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Looks like Carmine got a little hot
               under the collar.

                              CRIMELORD
               ... You're insane!

     The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and 
     mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE 
     FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

                              JOKER
               That's what they said about Lee
               Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
               THINK IT OVER!

     The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE 
     JOKER alone in the room with the charred corpse of ROTELLI. 
     THE JOKER sinks into a chair and -- as is his wont -- 
     ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Heck, they're not such bad guys. I
               say we give 'em a couple of days to
               come around.
                     (thoughtful pause)
               We-e-ll... maybe one day.
                     (then, casually)
               Aaah, screw it. Let's grease 'em.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. SMALL BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A poker game. A CRIMELORD from the JOKER's board meeting 
     picks up his hand and fans out the cards. FIVE JOKERS.

     He looks up, puzzled. The last thing he sees is a HIRED 
     KILLER bursting in through the door, GUN IN HAND.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - DAY

     A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from 
     a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2 
     strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be 
     politely refuses.

     THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But, 
     as we quickly find out, it's not a helium tank -- it's a 
     FLAMETHROWER.

     EXT. HALLIDAY PLAZA - DAY

     A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate 
     skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many 
     nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all 
     smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.

                              VICKI
               ... To tell you the truth, I'd just
               about given up waiting.

                              BRUCE
               I said I'd call you the minute I got
               free. And I did. -- And here we are.

                              VICKI
                     (teasing him)
               Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.

     He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki. Do you want the whole truth?
               All coyness aside?
                     (long pause)
               I wish I had more time to give you.
               Every day I don't see you, I miss
               you.
                     (beat)
               Now. Are you going to waste this
               lovely afternoon being all mad at
               me?

     All this, of course, is delivered with devastating 
     sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.

                              VICKI
               Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so
               much like someone I used to... 
                     (stopping suddenly)
               Bruce? I know this is silly, but --
               you're not married, are you?

     He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT

     PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- 
     enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way 
     along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.

                              VICKI
               All street mimes should be executed.

                              BRUCE
               ... Looks like a convention.

     And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging 
     on the center of the plaza.

     RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a 
     skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the 
     passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.

     A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME 
     reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.

     SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.

     VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's 
     HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT 
     with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:

     -    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY 
          and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding 
          the CROWD at bay;

     -    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully 
          imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;

     -    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as 
          OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... 

     ... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for 
     a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in 
     the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's 
     just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.

     He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, 
     CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's 
     practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible 
     anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

     A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.

     ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS

     BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.

     ANGLE ON BRUCE

     his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood 
     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's 
     almost as if the bullets are striking him.

     A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI 
     emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the 
     wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.

     As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- 
     with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks 
     up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so 
     desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!!

     He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's 
     eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.

                              BRUCE
               Oh my God... are you all right?

     He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.

     He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, 
     pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her 
     face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

               Ricorso's death is the third in a
               rash of underworld killings... 

     CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
               Commissioner, you've heard the
               rumors. Are these murders the work
               of the mysterious 'Batman'?

     A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the 
     TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big 
     desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.

                              JOKER
               All reet! I think it's about time
               we called another meeting, huh?

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand.

                              ALFRED
               I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him
               your messages. That's all I can do.

     ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously 
     distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY

                              VICKI
               Please tell him... I'm not trying to
               make his life difficult. I'd just --
               I'd just like to know what's going
               on.

     A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, 
     finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd
               like you to see.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- 
     all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins 
     cranking through back-issue newspapers.

                              KNOX
               Okay, here we go. Check it out.

     He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A 
     FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:

                      THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
            Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
            Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

     Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics 
     with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE 
     WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.

     The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask 
     of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.

                              VICKI
               Oh my God... I've seen this picture.

                              KNOX
               I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.

                              VICKI
               His face. Allie, look at his face.

     TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and 
     disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years 
     -- permanently, indelibly traumatized. The same face VICKI
     saw in Halliday Plaza.

                              KNOX
               Yep. He watched the whole thing
               happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
               Jim Gordon.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce... 

                              KNOX
               Something like this -- what do you
               suppose this could drive a guy to?

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     A greasy spoon off the lobby of the Globe building. KNOX
     and VICKI in a booth.

                              VICKI
               Alexander, you are on drugs.

                              KNOX
               He walks out on his own party. Half
               an hour later, the Caped Crusader
               turns up in full bat-drag.
                     (beat)
               Sees an execution, freaks out in an
               alleyway. No place to change.
                     (smiling)
               Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all
               right.

                              VICKI
               You're pissing me off, Allie. I know
               exactly why you're doing this.

                              KNOX
                     (leaning forward)
               Oh? Why is that, Vicki?

     VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for 
     a second, then changes the subject.

                              VICKI
               He's best friends with Jim Gordon
               and Harvey Dent. They would know.

                              KNOX
               ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession
               to make. I'm the Batman.

     VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Don't believe me? Why not?

                              VICKI
               Alexander... I know you.

                              KNOX
               Right. And they know him. And
               that's why it would never occur to
               them for a minute that their old
               buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night
               and goes out looking for --

                              VICKI
               This is pointless. I'm leaving.

                              KNOX
                     (grabbing her arm)
               Your little chum is out of his mind.
                     (relaxing his grip)
               Next time you call him up and he
               can't go out Friday night -- think
               it over.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - DAY

     LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above 
     the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing 
     production like a demented middle manager.

     INT. STOREROOM - DAY

     A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical, 
     which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-
     LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.

     CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping 
     manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.

     More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-
     seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the 
     initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.

     Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS: 
     RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title 
     page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'

     And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and
     orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing 
     HIDEOUS, CHEMICAL-INDUCED GRIMACES.

     ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.

     ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic 
     reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half 
     HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.

     The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the 
     floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.

                              JOKER
               How's that first shipment coming?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Right on schedule. Oh, we got that
               address for you -- 79 East End,
               #12-C.

                              JOKER
               Mmm. How'd you find it?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Called her agent.

     The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the 
     floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and 
     scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible 
     scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.

     One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of 
     Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a 
     massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.

     We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in 
     Corto Maltese.

     INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

     In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion: 
     mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN 
     BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.

     In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend, 
     CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.

                              CLAIRE
               ... of course, after Corto Maltese,
               this must all seem pretty tame.

                              VICKI
               Not to me. I need a job.

                              CLAIRE
               Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've
               got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.

                              VICKI
               Then "everyone" must know something
               I don't.

                              CLAIRE
                     (cattily)
               Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on,
               dear, Tony's dying to see you.

     In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, 
     is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They 
     all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around 
     hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.

                              TONY
               Yes, ladies, smiles, show me
               those smiles, fabulous, tropical
               smiles, think Tahiti, I want to
               see teeth, yes, those glorious
               teeth --

     As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place 
     simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

                              TONY (cont.)
               My God no, don't stop now, those
               smiles, I need those smiles --

     Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is 
     unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is 
     terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.

     The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH 
     SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.

                              TONY (cont.)
               Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
                     (beat)
               No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
               pull back!
                     (dropping the camera)
               OH MY GOD!

     The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering 
     convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN, 
     LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

     The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and
     DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead 
     SUPERMODELS.

                              PATSY
               The fashion world was stunned today
               by the sudden deaths of top models
               Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg.
               Cause of death has been attributed
               to a violent allergic reaction,
               although authorities have not yet
               ruled out the possibility of drug
               use. Dave?

     Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in 
     canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.

                              DAVE
               In Gotham, plans continue for the
               city's 300th birthday celebration.
               The four-day event will conclude
               with the unveiling, in Gotham
               Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady
               Gotham'... 

     A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               This bulletin just in. Nine more
               mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor
               in --

     Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               Patsy! This is hardly the --
                     (his eyes widen)
               PATSY!!

     An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat, 
     mouth agape in horror.

     PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY 
     RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS 
     UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

     TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy. 
     PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the 
     newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
     grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

     DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:

                              DAVE (cont.)
               KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --

     Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A 
     moment later, we're looking at:

     SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

     Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as 
     a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up 
     underneath.

                              MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)
               ... Love that Joker!

     INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

     THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- 
     THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The 
     shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK 
     HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.

     INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

     PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has 
     been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.

                              DIRECTOR
               WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

                              TECHNICIAN
               I DON'T KNOW!

     CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

                              JOKER
               ... new improved Joker brand. With
               the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL!
                     (a sweep of the hand)
               Let's go to our blind taste test.

     TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied 
     to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before 
     him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE 
     reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of
               sorts.
                     (wagging a finger)
               He's been using Brand X! But with
               new improved Joker brand... 

     ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his 
     chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!

     EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY

     THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before 
     him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH 
     DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               -- and the world smiles with you!
               Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --

     He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as 
     he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react 
     to the JOKER's maniacal promo.

                              JOKER
               I know what you're saying. Where can
               I buy these fine, fine products?
               Well, that's the gag, folks, you
               never know. Chances are... you've
               bought 'em already!!!

     As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:

     -    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for 
          a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under 
          one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can, 
          suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?

     -    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable 
          as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then 
          FREEZE with their forks in midair.

     -    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, 
          she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We 
          FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.

          On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE. 
          Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal 
          GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

     ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.

                              ALFRED
               ... Sir!

     HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT 
     begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.

                              JOKER
               Baby's got a tummyache? Here's
               something that'll fix him quick!

     He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering -- 
     he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Now on your grocer's shelf. So
               remember -- use Joker brand -- and
               put on a happy face!!

     MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed 
     transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.

                Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives
                WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?

     -    An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is 
          curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  ... sixteen new deaths, with no clues
                  as to the Joker's identity or
                  demands. The list at potentially
                  lethal products now includes:
                  perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --

     -    The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY 
          GUARDS rush to the scene as THREE MATRONLY CUSTOMERS
          go into simultaneous smiling fits.

     -    An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

                              ANCHORMAN
                  Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
                  -- underarm deodorant --

     -    A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF 
          SWEAT under every arm. The doors slide open; ONCOMING 
          PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.

     -    The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100% 
          natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing 
          altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly 
          visible.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --
                  moisturizing cream --

     -    A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers. 
          The store is utterly devoid of customers.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     From across the street we see VICKI headed down the 
     sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay 
     phone.

                              VOICE
               She's outside the Fluegelheim.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

     A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is 
     at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying 
     pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered 
     cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.

     In all the city, he's the only person still using 
     cosmetics.

     A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:

                              ALICIA
               Jack? Who was that?

     As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of 
     ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are 
     unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is 
     COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.

                              JOKER
               Get dressed. We're going out.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING

     A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something 
     Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open 
     atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along 
     the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You 
     walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING

     The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
     filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly 
     matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI 
     enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in 
     hand.

                              VICKI
               I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?

                              MAITRE D'
               No, but your table is ready.

     INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING

     VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A 
     WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, 
     bearing a single word: URGENT.

                              WAITER
               Miss Vale, this just arrived for
               you.

     As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is 
     a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

               DEAR V. VALE,
                    PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

     Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find 
     a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

     She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN 
     SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.

     TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART 
     LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

     VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. 
     Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

     INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT

     GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN 
     toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS 
     lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.

     The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open 
     and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
     street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.

     A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are 
     carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a 
     "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE 
     CANS OF BLACK PAINT.

     The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with 
     an appreciative eye.

                              JOKER
               Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.

     He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a 
     pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT 
     RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.

     He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, 
     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water 
     lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. 
     Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING 
     BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.

     He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I kinda like this one. Leave it.

     INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as 
     hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. 
     The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.

                              JOKER
               I think it's safe to take that off.

     VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes 
     the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're quite beautiful.

                              VICKI
               ... Thank you.

                              JOKER
               Unfortunate, but I think we can work
               around it.

     He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches 
     for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry 
     Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
               who I am. -- Is this your
               portfolio?

     She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of 
     VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
     Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. 
     Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... 
               Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.

     He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               The panic. The bloody skulls. The
               armless screaming fellows... you
               know, the atrocities.
                     (smirking)
               Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
               comes out so clean, so lovely.

     VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate 
     the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I guess I'm just an old cornball,
               but... I live for beauty. I look
               around at my little city, it gets me
               down.
                     (indicating the photos)
               We don't have anything like this.
               Well, it came to me that what this
               city needs... is beautification. Kind
               of a big makeover.
                     (enraptured)
               Miss Vale, I finally realized that
               one man can make a difference. You
               know the saying. "In his image... 
               created he them"?

     VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, 
     getting more frightened by the minute.

                              VICKI
               And you want a --

                              JOKER
               A visual record, yes. A before-and-
               after kind of thing.
                     (leaning closer)
               This could make your reputation.

     Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the 
     impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
     on film. She reaches for her camera bag.

                              VICKI
               Maybe we should start with a
               portrait of the artist. People might
               like to see the face behind the
               makeup.

                              JOKER
                     (momentarily puzzled)
               ... Behind the makeup?

     Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened 
     restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse 
     job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
     looking at his real face!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.

     He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very 
     carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- 
     suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
               you ANYWHERE!

     He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly 
     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.

     He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
     got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he 
     POINTS at the WATER GLASS:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Well? What are you waiting for??

     Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS 
     ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.

     His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked 
     Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to 
     wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.

     His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the 
     running makeup, he LEERS at her.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
               makeup.
                     (leaning forward)
               What do you think?

     VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.

                              VICKI
               I've seen worse. Much worse.

                              JOKER
               Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
               a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
               after all.

     He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's 
     coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind 
     them... and a VOICE intrudes:

                              VOICE
               Jack?

     The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and 
     moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing 
     the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

                              JOKER
                     (to VICKI)
               Christ, it's my girlfriend.
                     (to ALICIA)
               WHAT?

                              ALICIA
               You said I could look at the
               pictures before you -- before you --

                              JOKER
               Shucks, honey, I forgot.
                     (rolling his eyes at
                      VICKI)
               I'm in trouble now.
                     (to ALICIA)
               This is business, sweetie. Why don't
               you go outside and see how the boys
               are coming?

     VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting 
     eerily through the abandoned tea room.

                              VICKI
                     (hesitantly)
               ... Why the mask?

                              JOKER
               Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
               Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

     ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
               One in a million. A work of art. In 
               fact... 

     We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off. 
     The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the 
     side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               She makes you look sick.

     VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE 
     FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a 
     weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.

                              VICKI
               You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
               THAT to her!

                              JOKER
               What? I improved her a little... 

     VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE 
     BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.

                              VICKI
               I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
               -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!

                              JOKER
               Miss Vale, was it something I said?
                     (brightly)
               Do you want to sniff my flower?

     There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds 
     it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.

                              VICKI
               NO!

     The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID 
     spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

     She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from 
     the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.

                              JOKER
               Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
               THE ROSES!!

     He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --

     A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW 
     DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face 
     to face with... 

     THE BATMAN!

     On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER 
     like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM 
     THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --

     -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP 
     OUTSIDE!!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... YOU!!

     On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt. 
     In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT 
     OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR 
     STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!

     The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!

     His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp, 
     still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN 
     FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL

     He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it. 
     As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a 
     BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!

     TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up 
     short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI 
     drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.

     The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign 
     on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.

     VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.

     EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK

     VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET 
     into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

                              BATMAN
               GET IN THE CAR!

                              VICKI
               WHICH CAR?

     VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there 
     are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only 
     one BATMOBILE.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Oh.

     The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, 
     indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the 
     passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning 
     array of electronic gadgetry.

                              BATMAN
               Ignition!

     As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the 
     dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, 
     synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the 
     cockpit alongside VICKI.

     Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the 
     Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE 
     FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of 
     the alley at ninety miles an hour.

     THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.

                              JOKER
               I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!

     The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH 
     PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind 
     him, the other half into a second car nearby.

     EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

     SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.

                              VICKI
               Look! Police!

                              BATMAN
               I called them.

                              VICKI
               Shouldn't we --

     A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The 
     COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the 
     BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out 
     from the front of the van.

                              GOON
               There they are! Dead ahead!

     THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.

                              JOKER
               ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian 
     restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, 
     BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the 
     streets, eager to join the chase.

     SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS

     COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an 
     intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN 
     makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE 
     PAVEMENT.

                              VICKI
               What about her? What about the girl?

                              BATMAN
               He won't kill her.
                     (gritting his teeth)
               GODDAMMIT!

     They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION 
     TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and 
     inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.

     BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. 
     And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on 
     collision with a lamppost.

     He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE 
     JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

     ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a 
     crowd around them.

                              VICKI
               Can't we --

                              BATMAN
               Too many people. Come on!
                     (as she scrambles out)
               SHIELDS!!

     The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields.

     With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into 
     place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the 
     BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.

     BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, 
     vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.

     INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S 
     VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.

                              GOON AT WHEEL
               Are they ours?

                              JOKER
               ... I don't know. We'd better get out
               of here.
                     (into RADIO MIKE)
               Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??

     The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately 
     down the street.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, 
     dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.

     INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off 
     the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:

                              GOON I
               We got 'em!

                              JOKER (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Take 'em! I want his head!

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining 
     on them; and then, from behind --

     BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They 
     dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.

     They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.

     INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the 
     mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still 
     alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her 
     arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width 
     of the alleyway five stories up.

                              BATMAN
               How much do you weigh?

                              VICKI
               ... A hundred and eight?

     He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the 
     CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue 
     of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, 
     and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.

                              BATMAN
               HANG ON!

     The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches 
     on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL 
     on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.

     BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. 
     One story; two stories; and then... 

     They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's 
     goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward 
     another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.

     Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
     stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

     In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own 
     waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a 
     chance to protest, he LETS GO.

     VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the 
     way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

     VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the 
     line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row 
     of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per 
     limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam 
     two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --

     -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.

     BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off 
     and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.

     The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and 
     fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black 
     INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.

     They move closer. And stop.

                              GOON I
               ... No blood.

                              GOON II
               Jesus.

                              GOON III
               Wait a minute.

     GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the 
     body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.

                              GOON IV
               ... What is that?

                              GOON III
               Some kind of body armor.

                              GOON I
               He's human after all. -- Take that
               mask off.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

     Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the 
     roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as 
     the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this 
     height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a 
     sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.

     ANGLE ON GOONS

     peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE 
     WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.

                              GOON I
               Well?... Who is this guy?

                              GOON II
               I dunno. You seen him before?

                              GOON III
               Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.

                              GOON IV
               Good idea. Let's check his wallet.

                              GOON I
               We'll worry about it later. Plug
               him.
                        (beat)
               In the head.

     GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A 
     FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

     Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.

                              GOON III
               Goddam, it's the redhead!

     ON VICKI

     A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the 
     GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds 
     the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.

     ON BRUCE

     HIS EYES WINK OPEN.

     ON VICKI

     momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP 
     SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds 
     it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and 
     then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a 
     TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... 

     ON THE THUGS

     No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.

                              GOON II
               Did you hit her?

                              GOON I
               Who cares? Wax that freak.

     They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes 
     out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL 
     and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas 
     pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.

     In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body 
     THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage 
     can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.

     GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the 
     way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

     Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the 
     alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at 
     BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.

     BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

     Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised 
     on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH 
     GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.

     ON VICKI

     She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons 
     everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, 
     grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet 
     her.

     VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S 
     FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the 
     roll, then drops it down her blouse.

     But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens 
     her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the 
     alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.

     It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI 
     clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous 
     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.

     Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out 
     how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.

                              BATMAN
               ... Not even a 'thank you'?

                              VICKI
               Well -- I think you might consider
               thanking me. You were good as
               dead.

                              BATMAN
               That's because you lied about your
               weight.
                     (a long pause)
               Thank you.

     VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               I'll have to ask you for that film.

                              VICKI
               I just wanted to distract them. I
               wasn't trying to get a picture of
               you.

     BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The 
     telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.

                              BATMAN
               Please.

                              VICKI
               I won't let you have it.

     THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I know you can break my neck and
               take it. But the Joker's on that
               same roll. I --

                              BATMAN
               The Joker is a murderer. And you
               were as good as dead. So --

                              VICKI
               Look, I appreciate what you did for
               me. But this is my job. And I'm
               keeping those pictures.

                              BATMAN
               All right, here's a compromise. I'll
               develop the photos. You keep the
               Jokers and I'll keep the rest.

                              VICKI
               How do I know you won't keep them
               all?

                              BATMAN
               Because I'll take you with me.

     He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His 
     voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy 
     from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to 
     him.

     Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands 
     over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
     shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Thank you, Vicki.

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you going to take me?

     No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her 
     closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand 
     delicately along the line of her cheek... 

     ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS 
     into BATMAN's arms.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in 
     his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at 
     the BATMOBILE two blocks down.

     The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. 
     But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL 
     OVER the fearsome machine.

     BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON 
     CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the 
     Batmobile.

     He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
     from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.

                              BATMAN
               Shields open.

     EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

     TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From 
     within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields open.

     The steel plates begin to retract.

                              BATMAN (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Ignition.

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.

                              COP
               There's somebody in there!

     They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO 
     LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

     COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there 
     stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances 
     toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes 
     dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

     PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless 
     BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting, 
     dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of 
     COP CARS in hot pursuit.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and 
     approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms 
     and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING 
     HEADLIGHTS.

                              BATMAN
               STOP!

     BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN 
     and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.

     SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible 
     behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's 
     powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL 
     THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

     A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on 
     either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

     VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.

                              VICKI
               ... How long have I been out?

                              BATMAN
               Quite a while. I took the scenic
               route.

                              VICKI
                     (gazing around her)
               Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
               What's that?

     He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.

                              BATMAN
               Garage door.

     EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by 
     underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a 
     SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.

     Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds 
     later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.

     INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S 
     FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.

                              VICKI
               I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
               -- how did you know my name?

     BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I'm serious. How did you know?

     No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and 
     SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL 
     LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

     Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE 
     GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

     ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

     One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES 
     ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF 
     AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

     The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL 
     -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- 
     winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

     INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

     We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to 
     acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant 
     penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of 
     blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the 
     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.

     BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips 
     off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are 
     TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.

     VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and 
     picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to 
     examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.

                              VICKI
               What is this stuff? Kevlar?

                              BATMAN
               Better. It's not on the market yet.

                              VICKI
               It doesn't protect your head,
               though.

                              BATMAN
               That's why I wear a target on my
               chest.

     THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his 
     futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost 
     flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more 
     carefree, than some guys we could name... 

     ... like Bruce Wayne.

     VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping 
     at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.

                              VICKI
               How'd you find this place?

                              BATMAN
               Stumbled across it when I was a boy.

     VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses 
     overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               They don't come down here. They're
               afraid of the lights.

                              VICKI
               I don't like bats. Not that kind.

                              BATMAN
               They used to terrify me. But I
               forced myself to keep coming back,
               and --
                     (smiling)
               -- I guess I became the thing I
               feared the most. I'll do your photos
               now.

     He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the 
     kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the 
     roll.

     VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She 
     kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.

     She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair 
     of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.

                              VICKI
               Who pays for all this?

                              BATMAN
               I have sponsors.

                              VICKI
               The computers?

                              BATMAN
               I'm running a check on the tainted
               products. There is a pattern.
               Beauty products. Personal hygiene.

                              VICKI
               No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
               all be showing our true faces now.

     She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. 
     But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.

                              BATMAN
               I've tracked all the records. Every
               shipment, every warehouse, every
               loading dock. Nothing. No
               opportunities for tampering. Somehow
               the Joker is supplying tainted
               ingredients... at the source.

                              VICKI
               Wait. You can just tap into any
               corporate database you want?
               Anywhere?

                              BATMAN
               Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
               I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
               are ready.

     He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out 
     the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

                              VICKI
               You could've killed him, you know.
               You could have killed the Joker.

                              BATMAN
               I had to save you, Vicki.
                     (turning to face her)
               Here you go. I think I'll let you
               keep the whole set.

     She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four 
     shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but 
     there's no clean angle on his face.

     VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Care for an autograph?

     He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her 
     with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."

     Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is 
     trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto 
     roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind 
     him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.

                              VICKI
               ... Bruce?

     HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:

                              BATMAN
               Are you talking to me?

     He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a 
     SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw 
     on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Maybe we've had enough for one
               night. I'll take you home.

     Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the 
     BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his 
     utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Do you want to do it this time?

     VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as 
     he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Don't be afraid. I'm here.

     She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the 
     mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.

     FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
     burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW 
     fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

     The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: 
     liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless 
     cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays 
     underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters 
     emerge from the opening of a hit musical.

     In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, 
     his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son 
     BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, 
     head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.

     THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the 
     sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts 
     an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.

     IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES 
     are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and 
     MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle 
     BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF 
     JOY. And then, without warning --

     A HANDGUN enters frame.

     The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps 
     protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, 
     begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.

     MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at 
     her throat.

     The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But 
     MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.

     The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.

     The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The 
     pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward 
     the sidewalk.

     A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.

     THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek 
     we cannot hear --

     -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.

     BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a 
     handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's 
     purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the 
     boy.

     Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his 
     parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny 
     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around 
     them.

     He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the 
     GUNMAN turns and runs.

     AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
     winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics 
     with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped 
     tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.

     There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away 
     from us. We can't see his face.

     And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's 
     hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name, 
     LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in 
     GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.

     But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. 
     Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
     face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death... 
     and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
     violate this most private and terrible of moments.

     At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the 
     sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN 
     is smiling prettily at BRUCE.

     The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.

     A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding 
     white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING 
     SOUND cuts through the silence.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught. 
     The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her 
     hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.

     Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her 
     amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a 
     VOICE at the other end of the line.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki... ?

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT

     BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined 
     study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
                     (long pause)
               I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
               Are you there?

     INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI

                              VICKI
               Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

                              BRUCE
               I'm sorry about the way things went
               between us. I'd very much like to
               see you again.

                              VICKI
               Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
               would be possible.

                              BRUCE
               I wish you'd reconsider.
                     (groping)
               I didn't stand you up today. The
               museum was closed when I got there.

                              VICKI
               I, uh... 

     ON VICKI

     Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki? Vi --

     She returns the receiver to its cradle.

     ON BRUCE

     He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and 
     sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror. 
     She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

     Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into 
     the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe, 
     still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across 
     from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.

                              KNOX
               Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
               telling me -- the car, the equipment
               -- somebody's paying for it.

                              VICKI
               I just can't --

                              KNOX
               The FBI. You know who's got the FBI
               computer contract? Wayne
               Technologies.
                     (shaking his head)
               The guy's bats all right. He's bat
               shit crazy. This is gonna be the
               most incredible --

                              VICKI
               But he's not.

                              KNOX
               Not what?

                              VICKI
               He's not crazy.

     KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his 
     chair.

                              KNOX
               Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
               here... who dresses up like a bat. He
               goes out at night and swings around
               -- in his cape -- on a rope.
                     (throwing up his hands)
               Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.

                              VICKI
               Allie... he wants to tell me.
               That's why he took me there. Because
               he's trying to tell me.

                              KNOX
               Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
               he can talk to his car.

     The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in 
     utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her 
     loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               He has to tell someone. And I'm the
               one. He's trying to tell me.

     KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up 
     and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:

                              KNOX
               Well, when he does you know my
               number.

     EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the
     Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline:

                       WAR OF THE FREAKS
             Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout

     In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, 
     dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. 
     "WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-
     hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing 
     news:

     INT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY

     BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his 
     broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a 
     fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can 
     wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.

                              BRUCE
               Don't sell. It won't last. We'll
               ride it out.

     With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver 
     to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a 
     squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the 
     hook.

     INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is 
     shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. 
     The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.

                              WAILING COLLEAGUE
               ... a nine-million-dollar bath!

     BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the 
     door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank 
     of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to 
     make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a 
     number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:

                              BRUCE
                     (the familiar rasp)
               Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought
               I'd call and see how you're doing.

               going to talk to you unless we can
               discuss it.

               Hi, Bruce.

     BRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His 
     face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE 
     still squeaking on the other end of the line.

               Batman but it's pretty choice.

     KNOX, who has recently taken up smoking, responds with a 
     grunt. SUDDEN HUBBUB from the ONLOOKERS as a wave of VIDEO 
     NOISE wipes half the screen away.

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     Split-screen. On one side is the MAYOR. On the other -- 
     sitting in a director's chair with a big yellow HAPPY-FACE 
     BACKDROP behind him -- is the JOKER, grinning fiendishly.

                              JOKER
               Joker here. Can we talk?

     The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.

                              MAYOR
               "While this administration remains
               vehemently opposed to terrorism in
               any form, we are prepared to
               negotiate any reasonable demands
               which will guarantee the safety of
               the populace."

                              JOKER
               Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is
               kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having
               such a swell time, I just haven't
               thought any up.

     He shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But I'm a reasonable fella. If you
               want to make me an offer... 

     Panicked, the MAYOR and co. go into a quick huddle.

                              MAYOR
               All right, all right. Here's the
               deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of
               ten million dollars, payable in --

                              JOKER
               Ten million dollars. Ten million
               dollars.
                     (flying off the handle)
               Ten mi-- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just
               wiped out the stock market. I've
               cost you billions!
                     (petulantly)
               I want ten million and one.

                              MAYOR
               No, wait, please! We'll talk. Just
               tell us what you expect.

                              JOKER
               Goddammit, I expect to be treated
               like an ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!

     MORE VIDEO STATIC sweeps across the screen, pushing the 
     MAYOR clean out of frame. The JOKER leers at the camera.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I might just think up some demands.
               And I'm gonna talk to all my
               friends, and see what they want,
               too. And then maybe we'll get
               together -- have a little party --
               exchange presents.
                     (waving goodbye)
               Happy Birthday, Gotham.

     "The Shadow of Your Smile" comes up UNDERNEATH as the 
     JOKER's transmission ends and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

     INT. GLOBE CITY ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     FRANTIC ACTIVITY as REPORTERS rush to their telephones and
     typewriters. KNOX strolls slowly back to his desk. He's 
     sitting on the biggest story of his career... and now, as 
     he realizes grimly, nobody knows or cares.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - DAY

     A tiny island in Gotham Harbor, homesite of LADY GOTHAM -- 
     the huge, newly restored stone statue that welcomes 
     incoming ships. Her upper half is draped in a huge TARP 
     prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this Sunday.

     At the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big 
     wooden platform, complete with microphones, amplifiers and 
     spotlights. They raise a gigantic BANNER which reads: 
     "GOTHAM CITY -- 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION."

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A TAXI pulls away from the wrought-iron gate at the 
     entrance to the estate. KNOX ambles up to a stone pillar, 
     glances up at a VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the gate, and 
     hits a BUZZER.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
                     (through loudspeaker)
               Yes?

                              KNOX
               Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               Mr. Wayne is out for the day.

                              KNOX
               Actually, I wanted to talk to
               Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne,
               would you?

     KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. 
     Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY

     KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big 
     leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him.

                              BRUCE
               I've been expecting to hear from
               you.

                              KNOX
               Well, that's how it is, chum. She
               tells me everything.

                              BRUCE
               What is it you want?

                              KNOX
               Simple. You know the score. One
               column -- and I can bring all this
               tumbling down. I can take you off
               the streets once and for all.
                        (a shaky pause)
               I want you to hang up the suit. And
               I want you to stay away from Vicki.

                              BRUCE
               I can't do that. Not while the
               Joker's still out there.

                              KNOX
               Then stay away from Vicki. That's
               all I want, man. I just want your
               word.

     BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his 
     jacket for a cigarette.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               See, I don't know how it happened --
               she's a smart girl and you are an
               extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but
               she's in love with you.

                              BRUCE
               There's something I don't
               understand. If you've got the story,
               why haven't you printed it?

                              KNOX
               Because I --
                     (beat)
               Because she'd never speak to me
               again.

     KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs 
     out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
               have you got to offer? You gonna
               marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
                     (laughing bitterly)
               Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be
               Best Rodent?

     BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even 
     put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking 
     at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.

                              BRUCE
               Do you want a drink?

                              KNOX
               Yeah, a drink. "Civilized."  Man-to-
               man, right?

                              BRUCE
               Alfred, bring something for Mr.
               Knox. -- I'll have one too.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

     The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and 
     Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE 
     CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in 
     everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, 
     representing the King in progressive stages of 
     deterioration.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK

     She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               ... So we just pretend none of this
               ever happened. We never met. We --
                     (frightened)
               You're going to get yourself killed,
               Bruce. You know that, don't you?

                              BRUCE
               It wouldn't matter much.

                              VICKI
               I don't understand it. You can do so
               much good for people. As Bruce
               Wayne.

     He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the 
     same argument with himself a thousand times.

                              BRUCE
               Money makes money, Vicki. The
               foundation runs itself. -- I'm
               extraneous to the process.

                              VICKI
               You're one man. You can't save
               everybody.

                              BRUCE
               What it I could save a handful?
               -- What if I could save one?

     VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands 
     up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:

                              VICKI
               Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
               can't even save yourself.

                              BRUCE
                     (staring right at her)
               Sometimes... I don't know if there's
               enough of me left to save.

     VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               Oh, God. I've got to have some
               coffee or something.

     A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. 
     Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.

     VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on 
     his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.

                              BRUCE
               Are you expecting anyone?

     She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Who's there?

     THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.

                              DELIVERY BOY
               Package tor Miss Vale.

                              BRUCE
               Set it down by the door. On the
               left-hand side.

     The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, 
     tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a 
     moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick 
     up the mysterious package.

     Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!

     He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets 
     it down on the kitchen counter.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               It's just like the last time. He
               sent me a present before he --

                              BRUCE
               Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

     As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds 
     his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a 
     LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then 
     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
               it around with you.

                              BRUCE
               I feel naked without it.

     He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a 
     stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the 
     earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
               Wait in the next room.

     He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then 
     SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.

     Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is 
     full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into 
     the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.

     In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.

     BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the 
     counter.

                              BRUCE
               ... They're wax.

     VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.

                              VICKI
               "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make
               up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.

                              BRUCE
                     (lost in thought)
               That does it. It's going to be this
               weekend.

     The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. 
     Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.

                              ALICIA
               I thought you ought to know -- he's
               coming for you... 

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the 
     mouthpiece with one hand.

                              BRUCE
               Keep her on the line!

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you calling from?

     As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE 
     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP 
     COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up 
     a telecommunications program.

     A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --

                              BRUCE
               Finding out where she is.

                              VICKI
               How can you do that if she's already
               off the line?

                              BRUCE
               I've had an automatic tracer on this
               number ever since he tracked you to
               the museum.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

     MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding, 
     INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name -- 
     ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.

                              BRUCE
               Got it!

                              VICKI
               What now!

                              BRUCE
               Hang on. I have to leave a message.

     HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key 
     to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on 
     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.

     The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the 
     elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas. 
     The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall 
     and march toward VICKI's apartment.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

     BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing 
     dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the 
     DOOR unlocking behind her.

     She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.

                              THUG I
               Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
               fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
               to --

     BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single 
     sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS 
     at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the 
     shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick 
     succession.

                              BRUCE
               There's a garage in this building?

     VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his 
     element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.

     She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK 
     NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is 
     full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I've got to take him out now.

     He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key 
     off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Pick an apartment and stay there.
               And listen: call the police. Give
               them that address. Every available
               man.

     He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a 
     dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.

     INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO 
     ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the 
     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.

     BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the 
     thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van, 
     his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING 
     DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.

     He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels 
     around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
     forgotten something.

                              BRUCE
               Oh, hell!

     The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the 
     elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that 
     something is amiss.

                              GOON
               Hey, boss, something's up. The
               elevator's working.

     INT. VAN - ON JOKER

     Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.

                              JOKER
               DAMMIT! You can't get good help
               these days. -- Let's move out.

     EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling 
     out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE. 
     He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL 
     LIGHT begins to flash.

     BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the 
     BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's 
     BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.

     EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual. 
     But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky, 
     staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.

     Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow 
     belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the 
     intersection on a ROPE.

     INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER

     The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on 
     either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:

                              JOKER
               Slow down, you maniac!

     EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. 
     His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just 
     about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING 
     MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands 
     directly behind him on the horse's back.

     BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. 
     The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through 
     the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, 
     UNMARKED CARS are converging.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They 
     see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.

                              DRIVER
               Boss! Jesus! They've --

                              JOKER
               They'll be sorry. They'll be
               sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, 
     drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the 
     FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.

     EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

     INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

     We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat 
     beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the 
     city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect 
     sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

     BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING 
     TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its 
     hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --

     -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, 
     neatly tied in string.

     BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick 
     salute -- and the BUG is gone.

     INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING

     The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the 
     southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are 
     everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for 
     the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.

                              JOKER
               MOVE! Can't you do something??

                              DRIVER
               It's some kind of detour. They're
               backed up for blocks!

     The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view 
     mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.

                              JOKER
               Oh my God. How does he do it... ?

     EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT

     THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET 
     ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around 
     the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, 
     RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first 
     opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO 
     GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.

     BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on 
     the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from 
     overhead.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING

     CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the 
     FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:

                              EMCEE
               -- the most spectacular, most death-
               defying aerial stunt ever devised.
               Tonight -- for the first time
               anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!

     He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying 
     side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the 
     twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING 
     GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled 
     red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other 
     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL

     PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the 
     crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.

     On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He 
     lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly 
     against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- 
     driving it off the access road down into the brush, where 
     it nearly topples over sideways.

     ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS

     GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, 
     landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're 
     swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make 
     the return leap back to his own trapeze.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, 
     compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, 
     he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's 
     got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.

                              PILOT
               Ready to go, Dick?

                              DICK
               What's all the ruckus down there?

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding 
     trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its 
     side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER - 
     FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."

     The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.

                              JOKER
               Head for the truck!

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the 
     JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back 
     of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER

     THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a 
     massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of 
     BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!

     THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an 
     expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.

                              JOKER
               I love fireworks!

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past. 
     One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON 
     falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER 
     plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.

     MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and 
     weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a 
     wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER 
     veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously 
     close to the tall buildings along the avenue.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a 
     canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings 
     into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.

                              DICK
               NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!

     His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT 
     struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding 
     a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before 
     THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED 
     OUT OF THE COPTER.

     ANGLE ON DICK

     With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A 
     FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a 
     nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down. 
     And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --

     -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended 
     target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun 
     and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the 
     chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF 
     A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.

     ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists 
     his chrome spear over the windshield.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT 
     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES 
     CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up 
     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads 
     "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken 
     off!

     ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across 
     the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over 
     a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet, 
     ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm 
     around his waist.

                              DICK
               LET ME GO! LET ME --

     THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with 
     MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the 
     GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.

                              DICK (cont.)
               YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--

     DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his 
     hands full restraining the kid.

                              JOKER
               Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
               hot.
                     (glowering at BATMAN)
               Hands off the belt.

                              BATMAN
               Take me. Let the boy go.

                              JOKER
               Gosh, I could kill you, but then
               you'd miss my party. And I'd be
               real, real sad if you couldn't make
               it.

                              BATMAN
               What are you talking about?

                              JOKER
               Batman! Don't you even recognize
               your old pal Jack? After all... 
                     (cackling insanely)
               You made me what I am today.

     BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS 
     BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the 
     crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the 
     night.

     DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to 
     the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.

                              DICK
               HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
               MY --

     BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into 
     his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE 
     under DICK's nose.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. 
     COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.

                              REPORTER
               ... on a tip attributed to the
               mysterious Batman. The apartment was
               booby-trapped with the Joker's
               laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
               dead.
                     (beat)
               Also found dead at the scene was
               Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --

     CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of 
     BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other 
     screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.

     We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, 
     showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER 
     and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate 
     transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads 
     into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, 
     as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
     Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.

     Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
     flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE 
     CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.

     And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head 
     in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
     responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
     he would just as soon be dead.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, 
     unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.

     Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his 
     unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.

                              DICK
               ... Where am I?

                              BRUCE
               My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
               welcome to stay here as long as you
               want.

     BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast 
     tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on 
     here?

     INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT 
     march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.

                              DENT
               We'll send a team into Ace the
               moment the warrant comes through.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be ready when you do. Remember
               what happened at the apartment.

                              DENT
               All right, Bruce, what do you
               suggest?

                              BRUCE
               I suggest a nice big bomb.

                              DENT
               Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
               Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.

                              BRUCE
               Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
               the anniversary celebration.

                              DENT
               We've told him we'll deal. What
               could he possibly have to gain by --

                              BRUCE
               Do you still think the Joker cares
               about money??

                              DENT
               I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
               don't have access to all your
               expert sources.

     Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back 
     a moment, then turns down the hall.

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long 
     driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED 
     INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, 
     then climbs out and towels himself off.

     He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable 
     in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could 
     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray 
     bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and 
     tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's 
     costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway 
     behind him.

                              DICK
               ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
               so I figured I'd hoof it.

                              BRUCE
               Sorry. I can't let you leave.

                              DICK
               You can't keep me here, man. That's
               kidnapping.

                              BRUCE
               If I let you leave, you'll do the
               same thing again. You'll go after
               the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
                     (turning to go)

                              DICK
               Hey, man. Look at you. You're
               rich. You got everything you want.
               How do you know what's in my mind?

     BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are 
     filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.

                              BRUCE
               I don't care what's in your mind.
               You're staying.

     BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the 
     kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding 
     speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up 
     spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.

     DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a 
     move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.

     A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with 
     a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of 
     motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's 
     chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up 
     curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle 
     royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. 
     He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. 
     Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... 
     who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.

     A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:

                              DICK
               ... You're him.

     No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly... 

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               FREEZE!

     DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler 
     stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance, 
     a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.

                              BRUCE
               It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
               under control.

                              ALFRED
               ... Very good, sir.

     ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

     CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift 
     STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.

                              JOKER
               Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
               I'm here to tell you... we have had
               one helluva quarter.

     He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable 
     easels.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
               fear's gone straight through the
               roof. You guys should be proud --
               'cause I couldn'ta done it without
               each and every one of you!

     MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I feel it's time to expand the
               Joker line. I was askin' myself,
               what are the products that every
               consumer wants most? And that's when
               it hit me: the water you drink, and
               the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
                     (strutting across stage)
               Now, some of you have your eye on
               the profit margin. You're thinkin':
               this boy's too ambitious. You
               don't approve. In fact, some of you
               have been talking about turning me
               in to the cops. Or knocking me off.

     He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But that's okay. I understand. Not
               everyone shares my eye for beauty.
               And just to show there's no hard
               feelings, I'm throwin' a little
               shindig tonight -- and you're all
               invited!

     THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the 
     Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins, 
     no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
     living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling 
     corpses.

     One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.

                              JOKER
               Look at that, folks. We got 'em
               rolling in the aisles!

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK

     VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on 
     the pillows. BRUCE is in his robe over by the window, 
     looking out at his estate.

                              BRUCE
               All this apparatus, Vicki... this
               house, and the money, and the
               power... it was never mine. It was
               something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
               was something I inherited.
                     (pause)
               All I ever hoped for was someone who
               could see through Bruce -- who could
               see me -- and not be frightened.

                              VICKI
               I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
               I'm frightened for you.

                              BRUCE
               In all these years... why couldn't I
               see how it would turn out?

     He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now 
     she's truly afraid.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
               for me, there'd be no Joker.

     INT. BATCAVE - EVENING

     TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel 
     casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER. 
     BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver, 
     hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30. 
     29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
     countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his 
     utility belt.

     He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape 
     and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the 
     shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.

                              BRUCE
               Where's the boy?

                              ALFRED
               Upstairs. He's quite docile.

                              BRUCE
               I know that feeling. It won't last.

     BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks 
     on tremulously.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               He's a long way ahead of where I was
               at his age.
                     (taking ALFRED's
                      shoulders)
               I want you to treat him just as if
               he were me. Promise.

                              ALFRED
               Yes, sir.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be taken care of financially.
               Beyond that... you know what to do.
               Don't let all this go to waste.

     Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to 
     speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long 
     circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne 
     Manor. On the third step he pauses:

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Alfred? -- Thank you.

     As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies 
     himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

     BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current 
     time is 7:09 PM.

     He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, 
     and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep, 
     regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later, 
     BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.

     Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.

     At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing 
     closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME, 
     twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of 
     R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.

     HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the 
     clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with 
     its grating electronic WHINE.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

     The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage 
     point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out 
     the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up 
     the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights 
     off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's 
     forces.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge 
     shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with 
     a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot 
     outside.

                              DISPATCHER
               Boston, Philly: loading bay one.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR 
     and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and 
     taking half the chain-link fence with it.

     In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the 
     BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A 
     ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the 
     factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole 
     in the door.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and 
     SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are 
     everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and 
     PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

     CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass 
     dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and 
     COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It 
     doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving.

     TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny 
     voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:

                              COMPUTER
               ... Detonate.

     A beat. Then: BLAM.

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing 
     to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS 
     dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.

     All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.

                              COP
                    Good Lord!

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking 
     lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. 
     For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

     All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble 
     and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT

     DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham 
     Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming 
     stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, 
     ready to be unveiled.

     THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of 
     Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
     talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the 
     Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as 
     the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's 
     just another part of the celebration.

     At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a 
     microphone:

                              GOVERNOR GILROY
               As Governor of this great state, it
               is now my honor to unveil for you a
               very special lady -- a lady who
               stands tall for life and liberty --
               America's favorite lady... LADY
               GOTHAM!

     The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY 
     GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's 
     Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair 
     of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: 
     hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the 
     canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... 

     ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
     WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!

     Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE 
     SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS 
     ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: 
     the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the 
     stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD 
     stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.

     And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS 
     GOING DARK.

     EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT

     QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different 
     points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a 
     PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:

                              JOKER (V.O.)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
               little token of my esteem. HAVE
               FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!

     INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S 
     HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to 
     earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS 
     try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another 
     in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT 
     DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb 
     out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.

     DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED 
     COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, 
     DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled 
     subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.

     On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a 
     field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless 
     against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.

     FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats 
     and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of 
     an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... 
     only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a 
     SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild 
     street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
     her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.

                              KNOX
               VICKI!

     VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's 
     wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
               girl could get hurt this way.

                              VICKI
               Yeah. Deja vu.

                              KNOX
               What do you say? Let's head for the
               lights.

     In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS 
     are sweeping the sky.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
     huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
     portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.

     On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the 
     street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if 
     nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block  
     intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS 
     BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical 
     figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.

     The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN -- 
     smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We 
     TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT... 

     ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
     queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily 
     at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like 
     some demented parade marshal.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints 
     on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the 
     legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."

     Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT

     The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously 
     TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A 
     STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.

     THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift, 
     sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS 
     EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to 
     release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER

     The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the 
     reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and 
     wonder what to do next.

     They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a 
     sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they 
     HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE 
     TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and 
     destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN

     in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the 
     wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham 
     skyline.

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT

     FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE 
     FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.

     Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character 
     UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on 
     itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the 
     street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts 
     downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon 
     blimp EXPLODES.

                              KNOX
               So much for Underdog.

     THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all 
     at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK 
     SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to 
     engulf the entire block!

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

                              KNOX
               WHAT HAPPENED?!?

     VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up 
     the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!

                              VICKI
               Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
               got the balloons rigged with
               compressor tanks!!

                              KNOX
               Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets. 
     He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES. 
     At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling 
     to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT 
     streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.

                              VICKI
               LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
                     (frantically)
               Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
               find some way to tell him!

                              KNOX
               Great. How??

     They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS 
     SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES 
     and SKIDS TO A HALT.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               COME ON!

     EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT

     Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from 
     the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He 
     flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.

     It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in 
     party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that 
     current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.

     As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy 
     out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And 
     DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.

     Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT 
     TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.

                              KNOX
               GIMME A HAND UP HERE!

     VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of 
     the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel 
     assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... 

     ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its 
     massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in 
     the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.

     BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.

     EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing 
     MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on 
     the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE 
     CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.

     He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints 
     bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed 
     inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is 
     BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... 

     ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! 
     The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE 
     TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring 
     through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to 
     the ground!

                              JOKER
               No... NOOOOO!!!

     ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON

     as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in 
     the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it 
     now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it 
     disperses harmlessly in the wind.

     EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the 
     rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds 
     it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; 
     hits a button repeatedly... 

     ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The 
     damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
     fit of pique.

     A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back 
     for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of 
     twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.

     CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS 
     sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on 
     helplessly, in stunned disbelief.

     As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON 
     THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.

                              JOKER
               There. There. -- GET 'EM!!

     ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK

     A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX 
     throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the 
     spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.

                              KNOX
               GET THE CAR!

     The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the 
     Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps 
     off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of 
     rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.

     GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.

     INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

     KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL 
     LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally 
     exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.

                              KNOX
               HOLY SHIT!!

                              VICKI
               You okay?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
               SEE THAT?!

                              VICKI
                     (laughing wildly)
               God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
               that was the ballsiest move I
               ever --

                              KNOX
                     (ecstatic)
               Holy shit. Holy --

     He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between 
     his lips -- and BURSTS.

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!!

     His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He 
     looks down in genuine bewilderment.

                              KNOX
               Jesus, Vicki.

     That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and 
     slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the 
     street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

     EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

     In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, 
     past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the 
     one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear 
     through a CONCEALED HATCH.

     WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE 
     mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the 
     parade decorations. And one moment later... 

     A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a 
     burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, 
     leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops 
     low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he 
     streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
     SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The 
     JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
     him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips 
     through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and 
     BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN 
     stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's 
     clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.

     He's coming back for more!

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.

                              JOKER
               He'll be back... he'll be back!!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING

     The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full 
     speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either 
     side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The 
     REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO 
     FLAME!

     The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the 
     tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps 
     the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF 
     THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of 
     the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.

     And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as 
     the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE 
     OPEN!

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in 
     the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS 
     groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and 
     the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE 
     SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A 
     hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and 
     pulls himself up to the street.

     He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the 
     BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt 
     SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the 
     tunnel.

                              JOKER
               You do him. I'm outta here.

     The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They 
     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the 
     Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN... 
     inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.

     A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for 
     their guns, move in warily... 

                              VOICE
               Yo.

     The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of 
     motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and 
     green --

     -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only 
     one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a 
     red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS 
     and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot 
     or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the 
     plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.

     TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in 
     place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
     like haze, A HAND extended toward him:

                              DICK
               HEY! COME ON!

     And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming 
     wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an 
     extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in 
     agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath 
     him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.

                              DICK
               Now we're even, huh? Even up.

                              BATMAN
               How did you... 

                              DICK
               I hitched. MOVE IT!

     DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO 
     FLAME behind them.

                              BATMAN
               The Joker. Is he --?

                              DICK
               Forget it. Relax.
                     (beat)
               ... He's mine now.

     DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.

                              BATMAN
               DICK!

     THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is 
     unendurable. His body has finally failed him.

     He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as 
     DICK races off with murder in his eyes.

     EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky, 
     piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is 
     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old 
     abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.

                              JOKER
               Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.

     HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER 
     forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, 
     hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
     glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all 
     forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders 
     about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.

     DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear 
     pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS 
     at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS 
     DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.

     In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER 
     finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden 
     stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and 
     starts up.

     DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back 
     of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor, 
     unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA 
     WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.

     Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED 
     BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center 
     aisle of the old cathedral.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

     A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the 
     wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.

     The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on 
     the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:

                              JOKER
               I'm in the belltower. Don't land.

     INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT

     A PILOT replies through his radio headset.

                              PILOT
               E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.

     The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.

     INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls 
     himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
     Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.

     Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps 
     against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his 
     utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule 
     back onto his dry, swollen tongue.

     Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and 
     TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten 
     wood of the belltower stairs.

     THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. 
     And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN 
     MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.

     It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the 
     fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, 
     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.

     Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. 
     His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN 
     INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.

     For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED 
     WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, 
     trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last 
     ounce of strength.

     The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. 
     BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.

     He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility 
     belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making 
     earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at 
     his side.

     THE BATMAN is out like a light.

     INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering 
     what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves 
     cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... 
     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.

                              JOKER
               ... Batman?

     No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little 
     snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of 
     his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on 
     his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS 
     BATMAN up into the belltower.

     He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. 
     The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- 
     pats his face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Batman? Batman?

     THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I thought you'd be more comfortable
               here in the belfry.
                     (chuckling to himself)
               Before I kill you I'd like to see
               who you are. Would that be okay?

     BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes 
     and reaches over to undo his cowl.

     BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The 
     JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, 
     moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh my, aren't we pretty.
                     (brightening suddenly)
               I know you! You're the rich boy!!

     The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps 
     his hands together in sheer glee.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               My goodness, what in the world made
               you do it? It must've been
               something pretty terrible!

     He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You know, we should've sat down and
               had us a little heart-to-heart. I
               bet we would have got on famously.

                              BATMAN
               Mad... man... 

                              JOKER
               Well now, you're not exactly the
               picture of mental health, are you.

                              BATMAN
               ... Murderer... 

                              JOKER
               Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
               how many people you've killed by
               letting me live.

     A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his 
     helicopter approaching in the distance.

     BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his 
     utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.

     The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens 
     it gingerly.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
               won't even hurt. Now relax. The
               bat's in his belfry, all's right
               with the world... 

     He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE 
     reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER 
     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Why, Bruce... 

     Then he hears ticking.

     Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 
     0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.

     He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.

     BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch 
     convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

     BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!

                              BRUCE
               No... sense... of humor?

     The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks 
     better of it and retracts his shaking hand.

     He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the 
     clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his 
     signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.

     The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on 
     the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down 
     the stairs in a frenzy.

     There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and 
     counting.

     Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and 
     makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly 
     overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.

     EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT

     The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a 
     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD 
     LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost 
     losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures 
     wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.

     EXT. BELLTOWER

     A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves 
     -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of 
     the old cathedral --

     -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air 
     like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
     blind uncomprehending fury --

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, 
     cackles in mad triumph --

     -- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING 
     SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE 
     ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER --

     -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

     -- and plunges into the night.

     TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if 
     he makes his choice now.

     Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body 
     working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches 
     into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.

     It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.

     INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT

     The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just 
     enough to see what's going on.

                              CO-PILOT
               PULL UP!! PULL --

     EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly 
     silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies 
     splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the 
     churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in 
     the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE 
     FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.

     Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. 
     Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.

     POV JOKER

     Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, 
     bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the 
     sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE

     It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost 
     childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, 
     though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins 
     to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness 
     sets in.

                                               FADE THROUGH TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               As the details of the Joker's
               heinous plan become known, a city's
               gratitude goes out to the mysterious
               Batman. His whereabouts remain
               unknown, but Batman -- if you're
               alive -- if you're listening --
               thank you.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT 
     in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine 
     it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping 
     flowers.

                              VICKI
               I loved you too.

     As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she 
     gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.

     The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY

     ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.

                              ALFRED
               No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm
               afraid he's quite unreachable.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized 
     SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.

     In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. 
     Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping 
     him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.

                              VICKI
               I don't know why I'm doing this. I
               half wish you'd stay a cripple.

                              BRUCE
               Ohhhh... you don't mean that.

                              VICKI
                     (grasping for words)
               I don't, but... I do. It's just... I
               love you, Bruce. I --

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or
               all of me?

     A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for 
     several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.

                              VICKI
               I guess you did it, didn't you. You
               saved everyone.
                     (pause)
               Almost.

     For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls 
     her over, takes her in a tight embrace.

                              BRUCE
               I don't know how to explain this so
               it makes sense... but you saved
               me.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and 
     looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets 
     his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation -- 
     LEAPS INTO THE VOID.

     His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE 
     AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the 
     rings on his way down.

     Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the 
     pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOFTOP - GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

     A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the 
     distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling 
     finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at 
     the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.

     A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his 
     RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN 
     SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through 
     the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a 
     BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.

     We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN 
     vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new 
     adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we

                                                 FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

     The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.

     The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, 
     dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and 
     concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its 
     aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
     kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready 
     to burst.

     EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic 
     anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- 
     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.

     On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from 
     their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch 
     over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the 
     Gotham night.

     One of them is moving.

     EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

     The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of 
     big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. 
     Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-
     fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know
     each other... with one conspicuous exception:

     A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring 
     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the 
     main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks 
     over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and 
     now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in 
     the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

                              MOM
               For God's sake, Harold, can we
               please just get a taxi??

                              DAD
               I'm trying to get a --
                     (shouting)
               TAXI!!

     Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in 
     frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.

                              JIMMY
               We're going the wrong way.

     Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys 
     them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.

                              DAD
               Put that away. We'll look like
               tourists.

     TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night 
     souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. 
     The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks 
     him off down the street and glowers at DAD.

                              DAD (cont.)
               We'll never get a cab here. Let's
               cut over to Seventh.

                              JIMMY
               Seventh is that way.

                              DAD
               I know where we are!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of 
     stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath 
     and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.

                              VOICE
               Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?

     The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, 
     acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm 
     uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'

     MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then 
     move on -- pretending not to hear.

                              DERELICT
               Mister. How about it. One dollar?
                     (standing up)
               One dollar, man. Are you deaf?
               Are you deaf? -- Do you speak
               English??

     By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. 
     Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.

     They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE 
     in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand 
     brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.

     DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick 
     wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across 
     the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's 
     already searching for DAD's wallet.

     MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to 
     snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his 
     gun on JIMMY.

                              STREET PUNK
               Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't
               scream.

     The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her 
     face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to 
     shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.

     The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, 
     slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down 
     on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.

                              NICK
                     (emptying the wallet)
               All right. The Gold Card.
                     (tossing the credit card
                     in EDDIE's face)
               Don't leave home without it.

     A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the 
     cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct 
     CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.

                              EDDIE
               Let's beat it, man. I don't like
               being up here.

                              NICK
               What, scared of heights?

                              EDDIE
               I dunno, man. After what happened to
               Johnny Gobs --

                              NICK
               Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
               walked off a roof, all right? No big
               loss.

                              EDDIE
               That ain't what I heard. That ain't
               what I heard at all.
                     (beat)
               I heard the bat got him.

                              NICK
               Gimme a break, will you? Shut up... 

                              EDDIE
               Five stories, straight down. There
               was no blood in the body.

                              NICK
               No shit. It was all over the
               pavement.

     NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the 
     roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight 
     tingle at the base of his spine... 

                              EDDIE
               There was no blood, man.
                     (beat)
               My brother says... all the bad things
               you done... they come back and
               haunt you... 

                              NICK
               Listen to this. How old are you?
               There ain't no bat.

                              EDDIE
               My brother's a priest, man.

                              NICK
               No wonder you're such a chickenshit.
               Now shut up.
                     (conclusively)
               There ain't no bat.

     As they speak our attention shifts to a point at the 
     opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away... 
     where, at the end of a line, a STRANGE BLACK SILHOUETTE is 
     dropping slowly, implacably, into frame... 

                              EDDIE
               You shouldn'ta turned the gun on
               that kid, man. You shouldn'ta --

                              NICK
               Do you want this money or don't
               you? Now shut up! Shut up --

     BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of 
     BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS 
     DROP.

     Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a 
     BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.

     EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his 
     throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK 
     FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS: 
     GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.

     NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.

     And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate, 
     menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval 
     yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... 

     NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure 
     is knocked bodily to the roof.

     Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He 
     whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --

                              NICK (cont.)
               I'm gettin' outta here.

     -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a 
     strange, pre-verbal squeal... 

     ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, 
     NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.

     Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters 
     out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of 
     the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches 
     for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to 
     the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.

     EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face 
     drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes 
     out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --

     -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --

     -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a 
     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, 
     weightless puppet.

     THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES 
     NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES 
     past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... 

     A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches 
     forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming 
     now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming 
     figure of the BAT at his heels... 

     ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against 
     the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He 
     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.

     Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he 
     could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling 
     on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to 
     pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails... 

     THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with 
     supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.

                              NICK (cont.)
               Don't kill me... don't kill me... 

     When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is 
     standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at 
     arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.

     The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:

                              BATMAN
               I won't kill you. I want you to do
               me a favor.

     NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.

     He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where 
     BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own 
     stricken face.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Tell your friends. Tell all your
               friends.

     NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves 
     him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, 
     without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE 
     ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.

     Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over... 
     finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.

     NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow 
     globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:

                              BATMAN

     INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT

     An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: "A NEW GOTHAM. 
     HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY". We TILT DOWN to find 
     the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT, 
     addressing a crowd from behind his podium.

                              DENT
               ... it is no longer enough to go
               after the small-time punks and petty
               criminals who infest the streets of
               Gotham City. Crime and corruption
               must be attacked at the root!

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. 
     They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled 
     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're 
     going to enjoy this.

     Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling 
     water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- 
     the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has 
     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.

     The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.

     ANGLE ON DENT

                              DENT
               If elected, my first act as district
               attorney will be to return an
               indictment against Boss Carl
               Grissom!

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. 
     Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place 
     reeks of money.

     In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.
     Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle 
     with extraordinary finesse.

     In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, 
     with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.

                              DENT
                     (on the TV screen)
               Together we can make Gotham city a
               safe place for decent people to live
               and work and play.

     THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, 
     turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck 
     sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the 
     middle.

                              JACK NAPIER
               Decent people shouldn't live here.
               They'd be much happier someplace
               else.

     JACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to 
     Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost 
     feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his 
     appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.

     He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA 
     HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides 
     over in her negligee and snuggles up.

                              ALICIA
               Anything new?

                              JACK
               The usual gas. If this clown could
               lay a hand on Grissom... I would've
               had to kill him by now.

     ALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She 
     begins knotting it playfully about his neck.

                              ALICIA
               If Grissom knew about us... he
               might kill you.

     JACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts 
     back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a 
     nearby vanity.

                              JACK
               Don't think so, angel. I'm too
               valuable. That's the way I've
               planned it.
                     (pause)
               And besides, he doesn't know.

     JACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands 
     in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted 
     hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble.

                              ALICIA
               You look just fine, Jack.

     He smiles at himself before turning to the door.

                              JACK
               ... I didn't ask.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     The scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham 
     Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of 
     activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van.

     EDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. 
     Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE 
     MEDIC.

                              MEDIC
               That one there won't say a word. The
               other one's raving his head off.

                              ECKHARDT
               Variety, huh? The spice of life.

     At the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX --
     thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham
     Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed
     PATROLMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               They found him hugging a drainpipe.
               He was scared to come off the roof.

                              KNOX
               Great, but tell me: is this another
               you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's
               the third one this week.

                              PATROLMAN
                     (testily)
               I dunno. What's "what"?

                              KNOX
               Good answer. I'm gonna put you in
               for a commendation.

     KNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and 
     saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath.

                              ECKHARDT
               Oh Christ, it's Knox.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, gents. This anything I should
               know about?

                              ECKHARDT
               Nothing out of the routine.

     At this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain-
     fried NICK past the mouth of the alley.

                              NICK
               A bat, I tell you, a giant bat!
               He wanted me to do him a favor...!

     KNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade 
     disgusted looks.

                              KNOX
               No offense, boys, but these guys are
               seeing something up there.

                              ECKHARDT
               No comment. Print what you like.

                              KNOX
               Come on. One question. Is there a
               six-foot bat in Gotham City?

     KNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts 
     in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him:

                              KNOX (cont.)
               If so, is he on the police payroll?
               If so, what's he pulling down after
               taxes?

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. 
     He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling 
     across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the 
     dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.

     ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. 
     He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the 
     block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered 
     up alongside him.

     ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it 
     quickly in his coat.

                              JACK
               You didn't show up.

                              ECKHARDT
               We had another bat sighting.

                              JACK
               I'm sure that was vitally important.
               Listen: things are heating up.
               Someone is leaking information to
               Harvey Dent.

     ECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'm doing the best I can. If it's a
               problem --

                              JACK
               Eckhardt... our problems are your
               problems.

                              ECKHARDT
               I'll work on it.

     JACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his 
     topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the 
     material between his fingers.

                              JACK
               Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little
               ostentatious on a cop's salary,
               don't you think?

                              ECKHARDT
                     (knocking his hands away)
               I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to
               you.

                              JACK
               You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You
               should be thinking about the future.

     ECKHARDT laughs in his face.

                              ECKHARDT
               Ambition.
                     (nodding his head)
               Forget it, Jack. You'll never run
               that organization.

                              JACK
               And why's that?

                              ECKHARDT
               You're a psycho, friend. You're an
               A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows
               it.

     JACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The 
     fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.

     JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back 
     full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an 
     all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.

     By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. 
     ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.

                              JACK
               Here. Use mine.

     JACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in 
     ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT 
     to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the 
     stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement.

     ECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one 
     crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun.

                              JACK (cont.)
               It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt
               here is a good cop. A real good cop.
                     (pause; smiling)
               Inexpensive.

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     Gotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and 
     fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. 
     ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his 
     hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table.

                              KNOX
               What have you got for me, Jerry?

     JERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, 
     fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption 
     at the top reads: "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?"  KNOX nods in 
     approval.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Nice, but... maybe a little more gore
               on the fangs, huh?

     He pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED 
     COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out:

                              COLLEAGUE
               Hey Knox, you got a visitor.

                              KNOX
               I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and
               dust him, okay?

                              COLLEAGUE
               This one you might want to dust
               yourself.

     Curiosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops 
     in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. 
     The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a 
     WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, 
     her face obscured by a big outrageous hat.

                              KNOX
               ... Vicki Vale.

     The hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock 
     of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls 
     KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs.

                              VICKI
               How'd you know it was me?

                              KNOX
               Honey -- I would know any randomly
               selected square inch of Vicki
               Vale.
                     (grinning)
               If I had a good enough hint.

     He points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears 
     the monogram "V.V."  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Where the hell have you been?

                              VICKI
               A nice, restful vacation.

     She reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of 
     glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn 
     corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed.

                              KNOX
               God, a girl could get hurt doing
               this.

                              VICKI
               I do get hurt.

     She unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long 
     fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then 
     points to the scar and adds, slyly:

                              KNOX
               Got any more of those?

                              VICKI
               Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal
               here. What's new and hot in Gotham
               City?

                              KNOX
               It's too good, Vick. We got a six-
               foot bat that swoops out of the
               night and preys on evildoers.

                              VICKI
                     (laughing)
               Evildoers, huh? Big or small?

                              KNOX
               Small so far. I mean -- they don't
               allow bats in boardrooms, do they.

                              VICKI
               Speaking of which... I hear the
               notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a
               big do for the Harvey Dent campaign.

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every
               law'n'order freak in the city's
               gonna be there.

     KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI 
     may have a purpose in all this.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying --

     She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an 
     INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Aw, Vicki. Vicki!
                     (apprehensively)
               Got a date?

     She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. 
     KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, 
     nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always
               loved you. Will you marry me?

                              VICKI
                     (straightening her clothes)
               No.

                              KNOX
               Well, I'm starving. Will you at
               least buy me a hamburger?

                              VICKI
               Yes, but please -- be gentle.

     Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

     A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. 
     This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power 
     perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City 
     rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm.

     GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS 
     -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types 
     and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this 
     makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the 
     Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover.

                              GRISSOM
               Nine points ahead in the new poll. I
               don't like the way this is shaping
               up.

     JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's 
     right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle.

                              JACK
               We can always pop him. -- Or pop
               someone close to him.

                              LIEUTENANT
               Let's feed him to the bat.

     This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the 
     crowd. GRISSOM is unamused.

                              GRISSOM
               He's going after our front
               companies. Specifically Ace
               Chemical. Which would tie us
               in with Councilman Kane, Senator
               Miller... on up the line.
                     (pause)
               We have to clean out our files
               before the subpoena comes down.

                              LIEUTENANT
               How do we go? The usual fire?

                              GRISSOM
               I'm thinking break-in. Trash the
               office, remove the relevant
               documents... 

                              JACK
               "Industrial espionage."

                              GRISSOM
               That's right. And Jack --
                     (pause)
               I'd like you to handle this
               operation personally.

     JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the 
     deck. His hand freezes in midair.

                              JACK
               ... Me?

     At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA 
     HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. 
     She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS.

                              GRISSOM
               Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd
               mind waiting in the other room.

     ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side 
     door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM.

                              JACK
               Why do you need me to handle a
               simple break-in?

                              GRISSOM
                     (emphatically)
               Because I want someone I can
               trust.

     JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the 
     fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace.

     It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre 
     HOLE through its face.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               We'll work out the details later.
               But it's got to be soon. -- All
               right, that's all for now.

     GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers 
     behind a moment.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an
               important job. I can't trust it to
               somebody who'll screw up.

                              JACK
               I understand.

                              GRISSOM
                     (smiling)
               Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck.

     JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the 
     big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               My friend, your luck is just about
               to change.

     He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway 
     nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles 
     coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A vast, rambling mansion on sixty wooded acres a half-
     hour's drive from Gotham: old money, and how. Out front, a 
     team of red-jacketed VALETS are parking expensive cars.

     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A DEALER'S HAND pushes cards out of a shoe (the card kind, 
     not the Florsheim kind). It's casino night at Wayne Manor; 
     the ballroom has been outfitted with roulette wheels, 
     blackjack tables, etc., and the various members of Gotham's 
     power elite are happily -- and legally -- throwing money 
     into Harvey Dent's campaign kitty.

     DENT himself is surrounded by a gang of political cronies, 
     telling jokes, calling in favors. VICKI's off in another 
     group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots 
     and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a 
     corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands 
     ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.

     A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of 
     champagne glasses. He too looks up at the ceiling.

                              KNOX
               How high up would you say that is?

                              ALFRED
               I'd say about thirty feet, sir.

                              KNOX
               You know, if you cut your bathroom
               in half, you'd have my apartment.

                              ALFRED
               Which bathroom is that, air?

                              KNOX
               The small one.

     KNOX takes a drink and ALFRED moves on. A moment later, 
     VICKI detaches herself from her little circle of admirers 
     and hooks up with KNOX.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Man, I feel like Robin Leach. You
               actually know all these people?

                              VICKI
               Some. I am a rich bitch, remember.
                     (pause)
               I'm quoting.

     KNOX winces at the reminder. She smiles and takes his arm.

                              KNOX
               Yeah, I guess we move in different
               circles. -- Though I did meet a
               one-eyed pimp last week.

     ANGLE ON JAMES W. GORDON

     Gotham's Police Commissioner, a distinguished-looking gent 
     in his late fifties. He's at a craps table, blowing into 
     his fist. ONLOOKERS root him on as he lets the dice fly.

     Snake eyes. Crapped out. GORDON passes the dice as KNOX and 
     VICKI wander up alongside him.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner Gordon! What do you
               hear from our pointy-eared friend?

     KNOX puts his hands up behind his head and wiggles his 
     fingers -- like little bat ears. GORDON groans.

                              GORDON
               Knox, for the ninth time, and you
               can quote me -- there is no bat.

                              KNOX
               Aww, Commissioner. There's gotta be
               one honest cop in Gotham city.

     HARVEY DENT is working the room. He ambles up, claps a 
     friendly hand on GORDON's shoulder.

                              DENT
               How's your luck, Jim?

                              KNOX
               Mr. Dent. What's your stand on
               winged vigilantes?

     DENT exchanges a meaningful look with GORDON.

                              DENT
               Mr. Knox, I think we have enough
               real problems in this city without
               worrying about ghosts and goblins
               and Halloween characters.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     A NEON SIGN reads: "ACE CHEMICAL. FOR A MODERN TOMORROW."  
     From the SIGN we pan over to a METAL SLUICE GATE -- dumping 
     TONS of CHURNING TOXIC SLUDGE into Gotham's East River.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON the rear-view mirror. JACK NAPIER is meticulously 
     applying BLACK CAMOUFLAGE PAINT to his face. He could be 
     getting ready for a date.

     The van is parked outside a chain-link fence which 
     surrounds the Ace Chemical complex.

     JACK'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

     The SECURITY GUARD in a glass booth at the entrance to the 
     parking lot. ONE OF JACK'S BOYS creeps up behind the booth 
     and takes the GUARD out.

     INT. VAN - ON JACK

     He turns the key in the ignition, shifts into first.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     KNOX and VICKI are taking an unauthorized tour of BRUCE's 
     house, wandering through rooms decorated in wildly 
     divergent motifs, eyeing an astounding collection of 
     artworks and antiques from every corner of the world.

                              KNOX
               My question is, where does one man
               get all this junk.

                              VICKI
               All over the world. They say he
               spends most of the year overseas --
               until recently, anyway.

                              KNOX
               Holy shit... 

     KNOX goes goggle-eyed as they enter the LIBRARY.

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... We found the arsenal.

     One wall is lined to the ceiling with leather-bound 
     volumes. On the other walls hang EXOTIC WEAPONS. Halberds. 
     Maces. Blowguns. Bolas. Thugee ropes and samurai swords... 
     every arcane implement of death the human mind has ever 
     devised. KNOX lets out a low whistle.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               This guy has just gotten
               interesting. What else do you know?

                              VICKI
               Just what I've heard. Rich.
               Reclusive. Old money and lots of it.

                              KNOX
               Likes to kill?

                              VICKI
                     (smiling)
               Women find him magnetic.

                              KNOX
               I bet they like him for his big
               charity balls.

                              VICKI
               That, and the sweet smell of two
               hundred million bucks.

                              KNOX
               Well, you know me. The more they've
               got, the less they're worth.
                     (scanning the room)
               This guy must be the most worthless
               man in America.

     Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes.

                              BRUCE WAYNE
               You disappoint me. Why not the
               world?

     KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face 
     of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... 
     and intensely handsome.

                              KNOX
               I assume in my usual charming manner
               I've just insulted the host.
                     (extending a hand)
               Alexander Knox.

                              BRUCE
               Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work.
               I quite like it.

                              KNOX
               Great. Give me a grant.

                              BRUCE
               I might consider it if you introduce
               me to Miss Vale.

     KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she 
     is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead:

                              KNOX
               "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt
               redundant.

                              BRUCE
                     (to VICKI)
               You're just back from Corto Maltese.
               I saw your combat photos. Quite a
               departure for you.

                              VICKI
               That's intriguing. They haven't been
               published yet.

     BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question.

                              BRUCE
               ... You have an extraordinary eye.

     He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial 
     instincts aroused, pipes up:

                              KNOX
               Some people think she has two.

     VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance:

                              VICKI
               Don't mind my friend. He's a little
               nervous tonight.

     KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his 
     competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's 
     something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he
     could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's 
     almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation 
     of charm.

     This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't
     like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm 
     turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all:

                              VICKI (cont.)
               This is an amazing house. I'd love
               to shoot it sometime.

                              BRUCE
               I don't... seek publicity. -- Will
               you be staying in Gotham for a
               while?

                              VICKI
               As far as I know.

                              BRUCE
               Good. Then with any luck we'll run
               into each other.

     Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind 
     them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns.

                              ALFRED
               Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon
               was compelled to leave -- very
               unexpectedly. He asked me to convey
               his regrets.

                              BRUCE
               Thank you, Alfred.
                     (to VICKI)
               I hope you'll excuse me. It was a
               great pleasure meeting you.
                     (to KNOX)
               And you.

     Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and 
     strides hurriedly out of the room.

                              KNOX
               I know the rich are different, but
               that guy is real different.

     VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Hello? Vicki?

                              VICKI
               Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.

                              KNOX
               What were you thinking?

                              VICKI
               Yum, yum.

                              KNOX
               Well, he must like the way he
               looks. He's got a mirror in every
               room.

     And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous 
     WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to 
     ceiling.

                              VICKI
               I get it. Bruce Vain.

     She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we

                                                 CUT TO:

     REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR

     looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- 
     as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording 
     everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, 
     state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR

     showing KNOX and VICKI in the library. CAMERA PULLS BACK to 
     reveal that the screen we're watching is only one in a 
     whole vast bank of video monitors. From this control 
     center, we can see everything that's happening in the 
     house.

     Now we ZERO IN on a single screen: GUESTS moving backward, 
     with exaggerated speed, as a videotape REWINDS.

     At the panel, BRUCE WAYNE hits a button. And now we see 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON talking to a uniformed POLICEMAN.

                              PATROLMAN
               ... anonymous tip. Tonight. The Ace
               Chemical Company.

                              GORDON
                     (obviously agitated)
               Good Lord, it we could put our hands
               on Jack Napier... Why wasn't I told
               about this? Who's in charge of
               the --

                              PATROLMAN
               Lt. Eckhardt, sir.

                              GORDON
               Eckhardt. Oh my God... 

     And suddenly COMMISSIONER GORDON is grabbing for his coat. 
     The monitor goes black. BRUCE reaches up, loosens his tie.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     UNMARKED POLICE CARS are pulling into the lot, headlights 
     off. ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing 
     out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.

     The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.

                              ECKHARDT
               Shoot to kill.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     SPARKS FLY. A SAFECRACKER, in welder's mask, trains a 
     blowtorch on the office safe. Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are 
     at work on the filing cabinets.

     The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal 
     door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:

                              SAFECRACKER
               ... Empty.

                              HOOD I
               Just like the file cabinets.

                              HOOD II
               I don't get it. If this place is
               cleaned out already, what do we need
               five men?

     JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny. 
     By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.

     Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares 
     outside.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT

     ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE 
     BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED 
     COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM. 
     ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.

                              ECKHARDT
               What are you trying to do, blow the
               collar?

                              GORDON
                     (to SWAT TEAM)
               You men are dismissed. We'll take
               over from here.
                     (to UNIFORMED COPS)
               Any man who opens fire on Jack
               Napier... will answer to me.

     ECKHARDT tries to slink off. GORDON grabs him roughly.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               You. Stick around.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT

     JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two 
     stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network 
     of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.

     Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.

                              COP
               Freeze!

     One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his 
     colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear 
     exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.

     ANGLE ON GORDON

     standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building 
     and take their places behind heavy machinery. SHOTS RING 
     OUT as the HOODS scatter.

                              ECKHARDT
                     (snidely)
               Nice work, Commissioner.

                              GORDON
               I'm in charge here. Not Carl
               Grissom.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     TWO HOODS run down a tiled corridor in the office section 
     of the complex. They're almost at the end of the hall when 
     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.

     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant 
     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its 
     massive chest. BATMAN.

     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in 
     the opposite direction.

     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across 
     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands 
     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.

     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a 
     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL 
     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.

     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, 
     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts 
     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.

     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS 
     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,
     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.

     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES 
     -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he 
     throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES 
     SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of 
     plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place 
     over giant basins.

     JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine 
     to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.

     ANGLE ON CATWALKS

     BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated 
     walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them 
     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.

     BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED 
     HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS 
     HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.

     HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his 
     ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. 
     A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall.

     HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a 
     miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... 
     planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.

     ANGLE ON COPS

     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.

                              COP
               LOOK!

                              GORDON
               My God... it's him.

     ANGLE ON CATWALK

     HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. 
     BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III 
     with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.

     He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once 
     through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.

     Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the 
     HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB 
     UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE 
     STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK 
     to the factory floor forty feet below!

     INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

     JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; 
     STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking 
     lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting 
     for JACK to make his move.

     No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team 
     -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind 
     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.

     INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

     JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the 
     metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out 
     onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... 
     begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.

     COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last 
     pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.

     AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.

     INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

     COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses 
     out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN 
     FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.

     JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The 
     cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, 
     hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE 
     begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate 
     opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!

     Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If 
     JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting 
     shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to 
     his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.

     JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he 
     does --

     BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! 
     His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in 
     diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The 
     plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.

     An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm 
     around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED 
     STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... 

                              VOICE
               HOLD IT!

     In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind 
     the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT 
     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.

                              HOOD V
               Let him go or I'll do it.

     BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to 
     himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he 
     strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the 
     back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.

     All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. 
     HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he 
     waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.

     ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his 
     side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the 
     Commissioner plugged.

     ANGLE ON JACK

     at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. 
     He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a 
     supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling 
     black currents of the East River... and freedom.

     He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 
     AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor 
     of the catwalk mere yards away.

     ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR

     The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the 
     Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.

                              HOOD V
               Nobody makes a move. We go out
               clean.

                              JACK'S VOICE
               ECKHARDT!!

     ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands 
     poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops 
     ECKHARDT cleanly.

     The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a 
     NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at 
     the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- 
     a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.

     The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, 
     DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.

     AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. 
     JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. 
     BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.

     JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE.

     A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized 
     pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.

                              GORDON
               NO!!

     But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, 
     totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The 
     COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN 
     into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING 
     ALL THE WAY.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Goddammit, we had him. We --

     And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention 
     focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle 
     warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS 
     ON HIS BELT.

                              GORDON (cont.)
               Hold it right there, Mister.

     THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then 
     -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto 
     the factory floor.

     A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild 
     pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily 
     dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN 
     from view.

     A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling 
     cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.

                              COP
               LOOK!

     The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too 
     late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF 
     THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an 
     avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy 
     heights, safely out of range.

                              GORDON
               HOLD YOUR FIRE!

                              COP
               ... Who is this guy?

                              GORDON
               I don't know, but he's one hell of a
               showman.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A BLACK SHADOW scurries across the roof. From the 
     illuminated sign with its neon ace, WE PAN DOWN past the 
     chemical sluice to a SECOND ACE... a card from JACK's lucky 
     deck, pierced by a neat, round bullet hole, bobbing on the 
     oily surface of the foul, polluted river.

     As deadly toxins gush forth, OTHER CARDS from the deck 
     swirl past: a nine. A deuce. A queen. And finally, a JOKER 
     -- SHOT CLEANLY THROUGH THE FACE.

     A BONE-WHITE HAND BREAKS THE SURFACE as we

                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     A BANNER HEADLINE on the late edition of the Globe: "BAT 
     MAN FOILS ROBBERY. WHO IS MASKED VIGILANTE?"

     Behind the newspaper, feet propped up on his desk, is a 
     jubilant KNOX. He's on the horn to COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              KNOX
               Commissioner. Do us both a favor.
               Don't tell me some lie you'll have
               to retract later.

     CLICK. KNOX grins, lowers the paper, finds himself looking 
     up at the smiling face of VICKI VALE.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Vick! Looks like our friend the bat
               is getting ambitious. -- Why the
               dopey grin?

                              VICKI
               Guess who's got a date with Bruce
               Wayne.

                              KNOX
               Bruce Wayne? Date? He called you up
               and asked you for a date?... Shit.
                     (shouting)
               HEY MIRANDA! C'MERE!
                     (to VICKI)
               I want you to pay close attention to
               this. Miranda -- tell my friend here
               what you told me about Bruce Wayne.

     A SUPERANNUATED SOUTHERN BELLE toddles over. MIRANDA REITZ, 
     60, is the society editor of the Globe.

                              MIRANDA
               You mean Mister One-Nighter?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. "Mister One-Nighter."
                     (to VICKI)
               Because that's the average length of
               his relationships with women.

                              MIRANDA
               The current record is almost two
               weeks. That cover girl -- what's her
               name? You must've shot her, Vicki --

                              KNOX
               Tell her about the peanuts.

                              VICKI
               Peanuts?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Peanuts. Which is how he goes
               through women.

                              MIRANDA
               Like Planter's Peanuts.

     VICKI is about to break out into helpless giggles.

                              VICKI
               Plain or roasted?
                     (standing up)
               Alex, I'm very flattered that you've
               gone out and done all this research.

                              KNOX
               Why?
                     (blushing suddenly)
               Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter.
               I'm curious. I do this for a living.
               -- What'd you tell him?

                              VICKI
               I told him yes.

     KNOX fumes. VICKI shakes her head and laughs. She takes 
     KNOX's face in her hands, plants a kiss on his forehead.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               You're awfully sweet to be
               concerned, but it's really not
               necessary. I'll call you, okay?

     She exits. KNOX stands there looking poleaxed.

                              KNOX
               ... What was that?

                              MIRANDA
               That was one of the most gracious
               fuck-yous it's ever been my pleasure
               to watch. -- What a nice girl.

     KNOX, totally flustered, sighs and sinks into his chair.

                              KNOX
               Miranda, I'm busy. Go be productive.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. COASTLINE - DAY

     A CABIN CRUISER slices through the waves. In the distance, 
     closer to the shore, we see a throng of SAILBOATS.

     EXT. DECK - YACHT - DAY

     BRUCE's forty-foot cabin cruiser, aptly christened "DIE 
     FLEIDERMAUS." BRUCE and VICKI are on the deck, in chairs, 
     soaking up sun, gazing off at the sailboats.

                              VICKI
               Do you sail?

                              BRUCE
               Too much work. I'm not really the
               physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred.

     ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of 
     drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches 
     for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin 
     over braided telephone cables.

                              VICKI
               You do a very convincing imitation.
                     (sipping her drink)
               Mm, this is tasty. What's yours?

     He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for 
     her to try a sip.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Ginger ale?

                              BRUCE
               Two drinks and I start swinging from
               the rooftops.
                     (beat)
               Tell me, Vicki. There's something
               I'm very curious about. What took
               you down to Corto Maltese?

                              VICKI
               ... I guess I needed a change.

                              BRUCE
               You were one of the most successful
               magazine photographers in the city.
               Everyone wanted you.

                              VICKI
               Have you ever been to Corto Maltese?

                              BRUCE
               Not since the shooting started.

                              VICKI
               We went there once when I was
               little. I played on the beach. And
               at nights -- they had a band -- I
               danced with my father on the hotel
               patio.
                     (shrugging)
               That was Corto Maltese. When the war
               broke out I had to go back. And I
               promised myself that this time... I
               wouldn't look away.

                              BRUCE
               What did you see?

                              VICKI
               ... Terror.

     The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. 
     VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE.

                              BRUCE
               There's terror everywhere. Some
               types are just more -- familiar
               than others.

     For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his 
     familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I
               know it all seems a million miles
               away, out here on the water, with
               all this --

                              BRUCE
               Insulation?

     VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she 
     can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her.

                              VICKI
               Bruce, really, when I say these
               things I don't mean to criticize
               you.

                              BRUCE
               I think you see things very clearly.

                              VICKI
               I'm happy to talk about something
               else. I don't want to be depressing.

                              BRUCE
                     (smiling)
               Do you assume that if I know you
               better I won't like you as much?

     VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but 
     if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are
               you like this with the other women
               you know? -- Because I just can't
               seem to get a handle on this
               conversation.

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or...
               ambiguous, I think you should put
               the most flattering possible
               interpretation on it. Because even
               if it doesn't sound that way... 
               that's how I'll mean it.

     Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's 
     also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before 
     she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

     Rigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big 
     crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile."

     WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in 
     the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although 
     most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA 
     #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above 
     the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust.

     She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some 
     rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing 
     a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box.

     DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has 
     her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box.

     HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX

     BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and 
     whispers back.

     A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But 
     her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera 
     glasses SNAP SHUT.

     ANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3

     staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of 
     TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

     BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a 
     chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up.

                              VICKI
               -- but it's not fair. I'm half
               drunk and you're not even --

                              BRUCE
               Would you like me to take you home?

                              VICKI
               God. You would.
                     (sidling up to him)
               Come on, Bruce. I just want to get
               two drinks in you. As an
               experiment.

                              BRUCE
               Maybe we should just kiss.

                              VICKI
               ... We could try that.

     WIDER ANGLE

     BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry 
     hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite 
     walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to:

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

     Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole 
     near the Gotham docks.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     TIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect 
     in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of 
     an unlicensed gangland doctor.

     The DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner 
     of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors.

                              DOCTOR
               Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we
               did.

     He begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get:

     JACK NAPIER'S POV

     The last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands 
     there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His 
     eyes bug out. He GAGS.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     The DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock-
     still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face.

                              JACK (V.O.)
               Mirror.

     ANGLE ON DOCTOR

     He clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand 
     mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats. 
     Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to 
     the floor.

     JACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy.

                              DOCTOR
               You understand the facial muscles
               were completely severed --

     JACK keeps on laughing.

     The DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at 
     his seedy equipment.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               -- you can see what I have to work
               with here --

     MORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with 
     one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK.

                              DOCTOR (cont.)
               I'm sure that with proper recon--
               recon-- reconstructive surgery --

     A DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a 
     sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table.

     EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT

     From a point high above we see JACK emerging into the 
     alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head. 
     We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is 
     BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling.

     It's almost as though BRUCE is not used to sleeping at 
     night. He doesn't know what to do with himself.

     He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all 
     that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really 
     rather be somewhere else.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     LOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club 
     as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off.

                              KID
                    Nice hair, dude!

     JACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he 
     gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER -- 
     and strides deliberately across the street.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

     The spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate-
     glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the 
     private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in 
     the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk.

                              GRISSOM (O.S.)
               That you, sugar bumps?

     GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. 
     He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his 
     impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his 
     hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up 
     figure at his desk.

                              GRISSOM (cont.)
               Who the hell are you?

                              JACK
               It's me. "Sugar Bumps."

                              GRISSOM
                     (recognizing his voice)
               Jack?
                     (advancing cautiously)
               Thank God. I can't believe it's you.
               I heard you'd been --

                              JACK
                     (standing up)
               Is that what you "heard"?

     JACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't 
     move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly.

                              JACK (cont.)
               YOU SET ME UP!
                     (beat)
               Over a girl. You must be insane!

     GRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.

                              JACK (cont.)
               Keep your hands on the desk.

                              GRISSOM
               Sooner or later you would've tried
               to take me, Jack. You may get me
               now, but your life won't be worth a
               dime.

                              JACK
               I've died once already. It wasn't so
               bad. -- In fact I recommend it.

     GRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK 
     is utterly, hopelessly deranged.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --

                              JACK
               JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK??

     And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS 
     THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock 
     -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory.

     His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous 
     seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from 
     the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, 
     PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN.

                              JACK (cont.)
               I'm not a Jack any more.
                     (pause; cackling)
               You made me a Joker!

     THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. 
     GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the 
     desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.

                              GRISSOM
               Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT
               LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.

                              JACK
               HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!

     And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires 
     again until the CLIP IS EMPTY.

     EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, 
     arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW 
     spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit.

     INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from 
     this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel 
     chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline.

                              JOKER
               What a view. Our little city. It
               always brings a smile to my face.

     He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at 
     GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still 
     wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Guess it's my little city now.
               Wonder what it'll look like when I
               get done with it.
                     (pause)
               I bet it'll be something real fine.
               Real fine and pretty.

                                                 DISSOLVE T0:

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

     The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A 
     SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent 
     bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose."

     She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow 
     she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt.

     INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING

     BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to 
     himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He 
     instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick.

                              VICKI
               I didn't mean to scare you. I just
               had to come in here and see it that
               was really you singing.

     She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if 
     she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
                     (singing)
               "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to
               touch my cup." Come on. "You're my
               sugar --"
                     (no response from BRUCE)
               Bruce, you are such a case.

     BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly 
     recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost 
     childish smile.

                              BRUCE
               I don't sing very well.

                              VICKI
               Then there's one thing in the world
               you don't do very well. And I know
               what it is. -- Now you'll have to
               kill me.

     He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a 
     towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               Poor thing. You should stay off that
               horse.

                                                   CUT TO:

     INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

     KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the 
     Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and 
     there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. 
     It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town.

                              KNOX
                     (disgusted)
               ...Peanut.

     A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER:

                              COPY BOY
               Here's that morgue file you wanted.

     KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE 
     WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf 
     through old clippings from back issues of the Globe.

     WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE 
     HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE 
     VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in 
     dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell 
     a rich philanthropist can be.

                              KNOX
               Come on. Gimme some dirt!

     Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of 
     clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two 
     partial exceptions.

     One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the 
     camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an 
     ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair 
     down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN 
     1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               ... Why don't you like your picture
               taken?

                                                   CUT TO:

     INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT

     A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's 
     apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the 
     glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, 
     peering inside, hesitant to enter.

     As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, 
     tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's 
     almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her.

                              DOORMAN
               Miss Hunt!
                     (smiling)
               No need to sneak in. The rent's been
               taken care of.

                              ALICIA
               ... The rent? Paid?

     INT. ALICIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ALICIA, mystified, lets herself in and turns to lock the 
     door. She's startled once more by a VOICE FROM BEHIND.

                              VOICE
               Honey -- I'm home!

     She pivots. Her eyes widen. She SHRIEKS.

     Sitting cross-legged in an easy chair, a twisted grin on 
     his loathesome face, is THE JOKER. He's in a smoking jacket 
     and slippers, reading the paper, a dry martini at his side.

     This grim parody of domesticity sends poor ALICIA into a 
     dead faint.

     INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY

     It looks for all the world like a corporate boardroom. At a 
     long table sit Gotham's most distinguished criminals: 
     GANGLORDS and RACKETS BOSSES from every corner of the city. 
     They stare suspiciously at the head of the table.

                              JOKER (O.S.)
               So that's how it is, gents. Until
               Grissom decides it's safe to come up
               for air... I'm running the show.

     Now we see what they see: THE JOKER, dressed rather 
     flamboyantly in a big slouch hat. His FACE is layered with 
     flesh-toned makeup, and his HAIR's been rinsed black.

     Unfortunately, he can't conceal his ghoulish SMILE.

                              GANG BOSS
               So why don't we hear this from
               Grissom?

                              RACKETEER
               I got something I'd like to know.
               How come you're wearing that stupid
               smirk?

                              JOKER
               'Cause I got an army, chum. And I
               got Grissom's army. And this city
               is mine.

     CARMINE ROTELLI, an especially oily mobster, speaks up:

                              ROTELLI
               I don't like taking orders, from
               Grissom. And I especially don't like
               taking orders from Grissom's goon.

                              JOKER
               I've considered that possibility.

                              ROTELLI
               And what happens if we say no?

                              JOKER
                     (chuckling)
               Nobody wants a war, Carmine. If we
               can't do business, we shake hands
               and part friends.

                              ROTELLI
               That's it?

                              JOKER
               That's it.

     THE JOKER extends a hand. ROTELLI reaches out to shake it. 
     He doesn't see the JOY BUZZER concealed in the JOKER's 
     palm.

     40,000 VOLTS course through ROTELLI's body. He drops back 
     into his seat a blackened husk, SMOKE pouring out from his 
     sleeves and shirt collar.

     The CRIMELORDS recoil in horror. Before they can make a 
     move, a squad of ARMED THUGS burst into the room.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Looks like Carmine got a little hot
               under the collar.

                              CRIMELORD
               ... You're insane!

     The JOKER is a wee bit agitated. He removes the hat and 
     mops sweat from his brow, exposing a patch of CHALK-WHITE 
     FLESH -- to the great bewilderment of the ONLOOKERS.

                              JOKER
               That's what they said about Lee
               Iacocca. Now GET OUT OF HERE. -- And
               THINK IT OVER!

     The sickened CRIMINALS file out cautiously. That leaves THE 
     JOKER alone in the room with the charred corpse of ROTELLI. 
     THE JOKER sinks into a chair and -- as is his wont -- 
     ADDRESSES THE STIFF:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Heck, they're not such bad guys. I
               say we give 'em a couple of days to
               come around.
                     (thoughtful pause)
               We-e-ll... maybe one day.
                     (then, casually)
               Aaah, screw it. Let's grease 'em.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. SMALL BACK ROOM - NIGHT

     A poker game. A CRIMELORD from the JOKER's board meeting 
     picks up his hand and fans out the cards. FIVE JOKERS.

     He looks up, puzzled. The last thing he sees is a HIRED 
     KILLER bursting in through the door, GUN IN HAND.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - DAY

     A COSTUMED CLOWN with a wheeled cart, filling balloons from 
     a helium tank, passing them out to the kids. CRIMELORD #2 
     strolls past. The CLOWN offers him a balloon, which be 
     politely refuses.

     THE CLOWN reaches into his cart for a RED METAL TANK. But, 
     as we quickly find out, it's not a helium tank -- it's a 
     FLAMETHROWER.

     EXT. HALLIDAY PLAZA - DAY

     A sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate 
     skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many 
     nations. Amid the pedestrians we catch BRUCE and VICKI, all 
     smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.

                              VICKI
               ... To tell you the truth, I'd just
               about given up waiting.

                              BRUCE
               I said I'd call you the minute I got
               free. And I did. -- And here we are.

                              VICKI
                     (teasing him)
               Hm hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.

     He stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki. Do you want the whole truth?
               All coyness aside?
                     (long pause)
               I wish I had more time to give you.
               Every day I don't see you, I miss
               you.
                     (beat)
               Now. Are you going to waste this
               lovely afternoon being all mad at
               me?

     All this, of course, is delivered with devastating 
     sincerity. VICKI finds herself totally disarmed.

                              VICKI
               Okay, I'm a sucker. You sound so
               much like someone I used to... 
                     (stopping suddenly)
               Bruce? I know this is silly, but --
               you're not married, are you?

     He stops and laughs. She smiles crookedly, takes his arm.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS PLAZA - THAT MOMENT

     PHILLY RICORSO -- another CRIMELORD from the boardroom -- 
     enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of PAID BODYGUARDS.

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way 
     along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans.

                              VICKI
               All street mimes should be executed.

                              BRUCE
               ... Looks like a convention.

     And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging 
     on the center of the plaza.

     RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a 
     skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the 
     passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside.

     A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME 
     reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.

     SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.

     VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's 
     HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT 
     with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION:

     -    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY 
          and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding 
          the CROWD at bay;

     -    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully 
          imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;

     -    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as 
          OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... 

     ... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for 
     a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in 
     the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's 
     just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.

     He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, 
     CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's 
     practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible 
     anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.

     A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.

     ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS

     BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.

     ANGLE ON BRUCE

     his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood 
     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's 
     almost as if the bullets are striking him.

     A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI 
     emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the 
     wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.

     As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- 
     with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks 
     up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so 
     desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!!

     He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's 
     eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows.

                              BRUCE
               Oh my God... are you all right?

     He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back.

     He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, 
     pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her 
     face is full of bewilderment and doubt.

               Ricorso's death is the third in a
               rash of underworld killings... 

     CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON.

                              ANCHORWOMAN (cont.)
               Commissioner, you've heard the
               rumors. Are these murders the work
               of the mysterious 'Batman'?

     A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the 
     TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big 
     desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand.

                              JOKER
               All reet! I think it's about time
               we called another meeting, huh?

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand.

                              ALFRED
               I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him
               your messages. That's all I can do.

     ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously 
     distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY

                              VICKI
               Please tell him... I'm not trying to
               make his life difficult. I'd just --
               I'd just like to know what's going
               on.

     A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, 
     finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile.

                              KNOX
               Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd
               like you to see.

     INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- 
     all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins 
     cranking through back-issue newspapers.

                              KNOX
               Okay, here we go. Check it out.

     He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A 
     FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads:

                      THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED
            Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery
            Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed

     Beneath it, a PHOTO: cops kneeling over corpses. Medics 
     with stretchers. And off to one side, a YOUNG BOY -- BRUCE 
     WAYNE -- his arms wrapped around the waist of a BEAT COP.

     The BOY stares straight at the camera. His face is a mask 
     of UNFORGETTABLE AGONY. You can't take your eyes off it.

                              VICKI
               Oh my God... I've seen this picture.

                              KNOX
               I guess so. Pulitzer Prize, 1963.

                              VICKI
               His face. Allie, look at his face.

     TIGHT ON THE BOY'S contorted face, staring out in shock and 
     disbelief, his features recognizable across all the years 
     -- permanently, indelibly traumatized. The same face VICKI
     saw in Halliday Plaza.

                              KNOX
               Yep. He watched the whole thing
               happen. -- Recognize the beat cop?
               Jim Gordon.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce... 

                              KNOX
               Something like this -- what do you
               suppose this could drive a guy to?

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     A greasy spoon off the lobby of the Globe building. KNOX
     and VICKI in a booth.

                              VICKI
               Alexander, you are on drugs.

                              KNOX
               He walks out on his own party. Half
               an hour later, the Caped Crusader
               turns up in full bat-drag.
                     (beat)
               Sees an execution, freaks out in an
               alleyway. No place to change.
                     (smiling)
               Yeah, Vicki, he's "married" all
               right.

                              VICKI
               You're pissing me off, Allie. I know
               exactly why you're doing this.

                              KNOX
                     (leaning forward)
               Oh? Why is that, Vicki?

     VICKI wilts under the challenge. She holds her silence for 
     a second, then changes the subject.

                              VICKI
               He's best friends with Jim Gordon
               and Harvey Dent. They would know.

                              KNOX
               ... Okay, Vicki, I have a confession
               to make. I'm the Batman.

     VICKI snorts, rolls her eyes impatiently.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Don't believe me? Why not?

                              VICKI
               Alexander... I know you.

                              KNOX
               Right. And they know him. And
               that's why it would never occur to
               them for a minute that their old
               buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night
               and goes out looking for --

                              VICKI
               This is pointless. I'm leaving.

                              KNOX
                     (grabbing her arm)
               Your little chum is out of his mind.
                     (relaxing his grip)
               Next time you call him up and he
               can't go out Friday night -- think
               it over.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL CO. - DAY

     LOW ANGLE on the JOKER. He stands on a catwalk high above 
     the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing 
     production like a demented middle manager.

     INT. STOREROOM - DAY

     A dank, windowless room in the bowels of Ace Chemical, 
     which the JOKER has converted into a makeshift lair. SAP-
     LIKE GOO drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead.

     CAMERA DRIFTS across the JOKER's cluttered desk. Shipping 
     manifests. Ledgers. PSYCHOTIC DOODLES scrawled in crayon.

     More significantly: an old CONTRACT dating back to the mid-
     seventies. It's half-obscured by other papers, but the 
     initials 'CIA' are plainly visible.

     Then: a BOUND REPORT with the title 'DDID NERVE GAS: 
     RESULTS OF PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION.' Across its title 
     page, a diagonal rubber stamp: 'DISCONTINUED January 1977.'

     And finally: a sheaf of PHOTOS. Laboratory apes, chimps and
     orangutans, all DEAD. Their LIPS are drawn back, exposing 
     HIDEOUS, CHEMICAL-INDUCED GRIMACES.

     ON ONE WALL: POSTER-SIZED BLOWUPS of the grinning apes.

     ON THE OPPOSITE WALL: a large-scale photographic 
     reproduction of the Gotham City skyline, its bottom half 
     HIDDEN FROM VIEW by the JOKER's desk.

     The PHONE RINGS. The JOKER -- who has been sitting on the 
     floor by the cityscape -- POPS INTO FRAME and picks it up.

                              JOKER
               How's that first shipment coming?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Right on schedule. Oh, we got that
               address for you -- 79 East End,
               #12-C.

                              JOKER
               Mmm. How'd you find it?

                              VOICE ON PHONE
               Called her agent.

     The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the 
     floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and 
     scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horrible 
     scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation.

     One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of 
     Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a 
     massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS.

     We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... in 
     Corto Maltese.

     INT. PHOTOGRAPHER'S STUDIO - DAY

     In foreground, ROWS OF MAKEUP in startling profusion: 
     mascara, blusher, eyeliner, lipstick. HALF A DOZEN 
     BEAUTIFUL MODELS giggle into their makeup mirrors.

     In the background VICKI wanders past with a stylish friend, 
     CLAIRE, who owns and operates the studio.

                              CLAIRE
               ... of course, after Corto Maltese,
               this must all seem pretty tame.

                              VICKI
               Not to me. I need a job.

                              CLAIRE
               Now Vicki. Everyone knows you've
               got your hooks in Bruce Wayne.

                              VICKI
               Then "everyone" must know something
               I don't.

                              CLAIRE
                     (cattily)
               Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on,
               dear, Tony's dying to see you.

     In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, 
     is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They 
     all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around 
     hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses.

                              TONY
               Yes, ladies, smiles, show me
               those smiles, fabulous, tropical
               smiles, think Tahiti, I want to
               see teeth, yes, those glorious
               teeth --

     As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place 
     simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces.

                              TONY (cont.)
               My God no, don't stop now, those
               smiles, I need those smiles --

     Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is 
     unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is 
     terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm.

     The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH 
     SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away.

                              TONY (cont.)
               Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's --
                     (beat)
               No! Too far, too far! Pull back,
               pull back!
                     (dropping the camera)
               OH MY GOD!

     The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering 
     convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN, 
     LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

     The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and
     DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead 
     SUPERMODELS.

                              PATSY
               The fashion world was stunned today
               by the sudden deaths of top models
               Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg.
               Cause of death has been attributed
               to a violent allergic reaction,
               although authorities have not yet
               ruled out the possibility of drug
               use. Dave?

     Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in 
     canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty.

                              DAVE
               In Gotham, plans continue for the
               city's 300th birthday celebration.
               The four-day event will conclude
               with the unveiling, in Gotham
               Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady
               Gotham'... 

     A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               This bulletin just in. Nine more
               mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor
               in --

     Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS.

                              DAVE (cont.)
               Patsy! This is hardly the --
                     (his eyes widen)
               PATSY!!

     An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat, 
     mouth agape in horror.

     PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY 
     RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS 
     UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY.

     TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy. 
     PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the 
     newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the
     grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face.

     DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman:

                              DAVE (cont.)
               KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE --

     Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A 
     moment later, we're looking at:

     SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS

     Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as 
     a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up 
     underneath.

                              MODELS (CARTOON VOICE)
               ... Love that Joker!

     INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

     THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- 
     THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The 
     shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK 
     HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music.

     INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT

     PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has 
     been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL.

                              DIRECTOR
               WHERE'S IT COMING FROM??

                              TECHNICIAN
               I DON'T KNOW!

     CLOSEUP - THE JOKER

                              JOKER
               ... new improved Joker brand. With
               the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL!
                     (a sweep of the hand)
               Let's go to our blind taste test.

     TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied 
     to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before 
     him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE 
     reads: "NOT AN ACTOR."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of
               sorts.
                     (wagging a finger)
               He's been using Brand X! But with
               new improved Joker brand... 

     ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his 
     chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!!

     EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY

     THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before 
     him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH 
     DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               -- and the world smiles with you!
               Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable --

     He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as 
     he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss.

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react 
     to the JOKER's maniacal promo.

                              JOKER
               I know what you're saying. Where can
               I buy these fine, fine products?
               Well, that's the gag, folks, you
               never know. Chances are... you've
               bought 'em already!!!

     As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE:

     -    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses for 
          a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under 
          one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can, 
          suddenly uncertain. Could it be...?

     -    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable 
          as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then 
          FREEZE with their forks in midair.

     -    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, 
          she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We 
          FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door.

          On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE. 
          Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal 
          GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

     ALFRED THE BUTLER in a crouch, glued to the tube.

                              ALFRED
               ... Sir!

     HIS POV: THE JOKER in tight closeup. Offscreen, an INFANT 
     begins to squall. THE JOKER cocks an eyebrow.

                              JOKER
               Baby's got a tummyache? Here's
               something that'll fix him quick!

     He tosses a JOKER PRODUCT out of frame. Then -- leering -- 
     he gives the camera a BIG JUICY WINK.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Now on your grocer's shelf. So
               remember -- use Joker brand -- and
               put on a happy face!!

     MUSIC UP. VIDEO SNOW fills the screen as the jammed 
     transmission end. ALFRED looks over his shoulder.

                Contaminated Products Claim 72 Lives
                WHO IS THE MYSTERIOUS "JOKER"?

     -    An ANCHORWOMAN on the evening news. Her complexion is 
          curiously sallow. BLACK BAGS show under her eyes.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  ... sixteen new deaths, with no clues
                  as to the Joker's identity or
                  demands. The list at potentially
                  lethal products now includes:
                  perfume -- mascara -- cold cream --

     -    The makeover counter at Bloomingdale's. SECURITY 
          GUARDS rush to the scene as THREE MATRONLY CUSTOMERS
          go into simultaneous smiling fits.

     -    An ANCHORMAN with a BIG UGLY ZIT on his nose:

                              ANCHORMAN
                  Men's cologne toothpaste mouthwash
                  -- underarm deodorant --

     -    A SUBWAY CAR jammed with STRAPHANGERS. HUGE PATCHES OF 
          SWEAT under every arm. The doors slide open; ONCOMING 
          PASSENGERS RECOIL VISIBLY at the unendurable stench.

     -    The original ANCHORWOMAN, whose look is now 100% 
          natural. Her hair is frizzy. Her eyebrows are missing 
          altogether. Every wrinkle on her face is plainly 
          visible.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
                  Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --
                  moisturizing cream --

     -    A LARGE DRUGSTORE. CASHIERS sit idly by the registers. 
          The store is utterly devoid of customers.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     From across the street we see VICKI headed down the 
     sidewalk toward a museum. A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay 
     phone.

                              VOICE
               She's outside the Fluegelheim.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

     A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is 
     at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying 
     pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered 
     cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.

     In all the city, he's the only person still using 
     cosmetics.

     A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:

                              ALICIA
               Jack? Who was that?

     As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of 
     ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are 
     unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is 
     COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.

                              JOKER
               Get dressed. We're going out.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING

     A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something 
     Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open 
     atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along 
     the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You 
     walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.

     INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING

     The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-
     filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly 
     matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI 
     enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in 
     hand.

                              VICKI
               I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here?

                              MAITRE D'
               No, but your table is ready.

     INT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING

     VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A 
     WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, 
     bearing a single word: URGENT.

                              WAITER
               Miss Vale, this just arrived for
               you.

     As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is 
     a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.

               DEAR V. VALE,
                    PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW.

     Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find 
     a MINIATURE GAS MASK.

     She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN 
     SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.

     TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART 
     LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.

     VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. 
     Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.

     INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT

     GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN 
     toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS 
     lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.

     The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open 
     and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his
     street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.

     A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are 
     carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a 
     "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE 
     CANS OF BLACK PAINT.

     The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with 
     an appreciative eye.

                              JOKER
               Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.

     He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a 
     pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT 
     RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.

     He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, 
     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water 
     lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. 
     Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING 
     BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.

     He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM."

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I kinda like this one. Leave it.

     INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as 
     hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. 
     The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.

                              JOKER
               I think it's safe to take that off.

     VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes 
     the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're quite beautiful.

                              VICKI
               ... Thank you.

                              JOKER
               Unfortunate, but I think we can work
               around it.

     He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches 
     for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry 
     Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know
               who I am. -- Is this your
               portfolio?

     She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of 
     VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first.
     Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. 
     Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... 
               Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.

     He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               The panic. The bloody skulls. The
               armless screaming fellows... you
               know, the atrocities.
                     (smirking)
               Somehow, when you shoot it, it all
               comes out so clean, so lovely.

     VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate 
     the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I guess I'm just an old cornball,
               but... I live for beauty. I look
               around at my little city, it gets me
               down.
                     (indicating the photos)
               We don't have anything like this.
               Well, it came to me that what this
               city needs... is beautification. Kind
               of a big makeover.
                     (enraptured)
               Miss Vale, I finally realized that
               one man can make a difference. You
               know the saying. "In his image... 
               created he them"?

     VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, 
     getting more frightened by the minute.

                              VICKI
               And you want a --

                              JOKER
               A visual record, yes. A before-and-
               after kind of thing.
                     (leaning closer)
               This could make your reputation.

     Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the 
     impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac
     on film. She reaches for her camera bag.

                              VICKI
               Maybe we should start with a
               portrait of the artist. People might
               like to see the face behind the
               makeup.

                              JOKER
                     (momentarily puzzled)
               ... Behind the makeup?

     Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened 
     restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse 
     job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's
     looking at his real face!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.

     He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very 
     carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- 
     suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Silly little TWIT -- I can't take
               you ANYWHERE!

     He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly 
     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.

     He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't
     got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he 
     POINTS at the WATER GLASS:

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Well? What are you waiting for??

     Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS 
     ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.

     His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked 
     Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to 
     wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.

     His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the 
     running makeup, he LEERS at her.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale -- that was my
               makeup.
                     (leaning forward)
               What do you think?

     VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.

                              VICKI
               I've seen worse. Much worse.

                              JOKER
               Strong stomach, huh? I like that in
               a woman. -- Maybe we can do business
               after all.

     He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's 
     coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind 
     them... and a VOICE intrudes:

                              VOICE
               Jack?

     The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and 
     moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike. She's still wearing 
     the porcelain DOLL'S MASK we saw earlier.

                              JOKER
                     (to VICKI)
               Christ, it's my girlfriend.
                     (to ALICIA)
               WHAT?

                              ALICIA
               You said I could look at the
               pictures before you -- before you --

                              JOKER
               Shucks, honey, I forgot.
                     (rolling his eyes at
                      VICKI)
               I'm in trouble now.
                     (to ALICIA)
               This is business, sweetie. Why don't
               you go outside and see how the boys
               are coming?

     VICKI can't take her eyes off this strange figure drifting 
     eerily through the abandoned tea room.

                              VICKI
                     (hesitantly)
               ... Why the mask?

                              JOKER
               Alicia! Come here, have a seat. Show
               Miss Vale why you wear the mask.

     ALICIA sits down numbly and begins to undo the mask.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You see, Miss Vale, Alicia's beautiful.
               One in a million. A work of art. In 
               fact... 

     We're looking at ALICIA's profile as the mask comes off. 
     The side that's turned to us is indeed beautiful. But the 
     side we can't see... SENDS VICKI RIGHT OVER THE EDGE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               She makes you look sick.

     VICKI lurches out of her seat, knocking it over, HER FACE 
     FROZEN IN HORROR. She finds her CAMERA, holds it out like a 
     weapon as THE JOKER advances on her.

                              VICKI
               You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID
               THAT to her!

                              JOKER
               What? I improved her a little... 

     VICKI backs away, snapping the shutter on her camera. HE 
     BLINKS as the flash gun goes off repeatedly.

                              VICKI
               I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead.
               -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!

                              JOKER
               Miss Vale, was it something I said?
                     (brightly)
               Do you want to sniff my flower?

     There's a BRIGHT PURPLE BOUTONNIERE in his lapel. He holds 
     it up for VICKI's inspection as he moves menacingly closer.

                              VICKI
               NO!

     The JOKER squeezes a concealed BULB. A JET OF CLEAR LIQUID 
     spurts out of the FLOWER, NARROWLY MISSING VICKI.

     She GASPS. BUMPS INTO A TABLE. ACRID BLACK SMOKE rises from 
     the floor where the clear liquid hit. Acid.

                              JOKER
               Come on, Miss Vale... STOP AND SMELL
               THE ROSES!!

     He backs VICKI into a corner. And then -- abruptly --

     A SKYLIGHT SHATTERS IN A HAIL OF GLASS! A CAPED SHADOW 
     DROPS TO THE FLOOR OF THE RESTAURANT! And THE JOKER is face 
     to face with... 

     THE BATMAN!

     On his wrist is a STEEL GAUNTLET. Ha AIMS IT at the JOKER 
     like a weapon. Then PIVOTS SUDDENLY -- POINTS HIS ARM 
     THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE RESTAURANT --

     -- AND FIRES A METAL SPIKE into the adobe wall of the RAMP 
     OUTSIDE!!

                              JOKER (cont.)
               ... YOU!!

     On the end of the spike is a CORD leading to BATMAN's belt. 
     In the wink of an eye he's GRABBED VICKI -- DRAGGED HER OUT 
     OF the tea room -- and PLUNGED OVER THE RAMP WALL, FOUR 
     STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE ATRIUM FLOOR BELOW!!!

     The JOKER races to the edge of the ramp.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               GET 'EM!! GET 'EM!!

     His GOONS are stationed at various points along the ramp, 
     still defacing masterpieces. They pull their guns and OPEN 
     FIRE as BATMAN and VICKI plummet past.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN AND VICKI - AS THEY FALL

     He holds the gauntlet overhead, ROPE whistling through it. 
     As we watch, the gauntlet sprouts STEEL WINGS -- forming a 
     BULLETPROOF SHIELD over their heads!

     TWO FEET ABOVE the marble floor, THE ROPE jerks them up 
     short -- like a bunjee cord. GUNS BLAZE as BATMAN and VICKI 
     drop safely to earth and MAKE FOR THE EXIT.

     The doors are LOCKED. BATMAN spots the black "CLOSED" sign 
     on a metal stand. He HEAVES IT through the glass doors.

     VICKI hustles through. He points her to a side alley.

     EXT. SIDE ALLEY - THAT MOMENT - DUSK

     VICKI rounds the corner just as BATMAN lobs a SMOKE PELLET 
     into the doorway of the Fluegelheim.

                              BATMAN
               GET IN THE CAR!

                              VICKI
               WHICH CAR?

     VICKI suddenly feels quite stupid. Because -- while there 
     are many cars parked along the side alley -- there is only 
     one BATMOBILE.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               ... Oh.

     The BATMOBILE is sleek, futuristic, and... well, 
     indescribable. Imagine your own. VICKI climbs into the 
     passenger seat and is immediately dazzled by a stunning 
     array of electronic gadgetry.

                              BATMAN
               Ignition!

     As BATMAN sprints down the alley, a COMPUTER DISPLAY on the 
     dashboard registers his unique voiceprint. A tinny, 
     synthesized VOICE repeats the command:

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the 
     cockpit alongside VICKI.

     Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the 
     Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE 
     FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of 
     the alley at ninety miles an hour.

     THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off.

                              JOKER
               I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!!

     The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH 
     PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind 
     him, the other half into a second car nearby.

     EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

     SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC.

                              VICKI
               Look! Police!

                              BATMAN
               I called them.

                              VICKI
               Shouldn't we --

     A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The 
     COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the 
     BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out 
     from the front of the van.

                              GOON
               There they are! Dead ahead!

     THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE.

                              JOKER
               ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian 
     restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, 
     BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the 
     streets, eager to join the chase.

     SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS

     COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an 
     intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN 
     makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE 
     PAVEMENT.

                              VICKI
               What about her? What about the girl?

                              BATMAN
               He won't kill her.
                     (gritting his teeth)
               GODDAMMIT!

     They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION 
     TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and 
     inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION.

     BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. 
     And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on 
     collision with a lamppost.

     He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE 
     JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast.

     ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a 
     crowd around them.

                              VICKI
               Can't we --

                              BATMAN
               Too many people. Come on!
                     (as she scrambles out)
               SHIELDS!!

     The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields.

     With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into 
     place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the 
     BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL.

     BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, 
     vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble.

     INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT

     THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S 
     VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE.

                              GOON AT WHEEL
               Are they ours?

                              JOKER
               ... I don't know. We'd better get out
               of here.
                     (into RADIO MIKE)
               Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY??

     The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately 
     down the street.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, 
     dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS.

     INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off 
     the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio:

                              GOON I
               We got 'em!

                              JOKER (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Take 'em! I want his head!

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN and VICKI race down the sidewalk. The car is gaining 
     on them; and then, from behind --

     BATMAN and VICKI are caught in a SPRAY OF BULLETS. They 
     dive. Drop behind a parked car. And don't come up.

     They've ducked into a BLIND ALLEY.

     INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the 
     mouth of the alley. VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still 
     alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her 
     arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width 
     of the alleyway five stories up.

                              BATMAN
               How much do you weigh?

                              VICKI
               ... A hundred and eight?

     He does some quick mental calculations. A beat. Then the 
     CAR reappears -- backing up -- blocking their only avenue 
     of escape. BATMAN unfurls a rope, HEAVES A BATARANG UPWARD, 
     and grabs VICKI roughly about the waist.

                              BATMAN
               HANG ON!

     The JOKER'S THUGS pile out of the car. The BATARANG catches 
     on the catwalk, and BATMAN triggers the spring-action REEL 
     on his utility belt -- jerking him and VICKI INTO THE AIR.

     BULLETS zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. 
     One story; two stories; and then... 

     They slow. They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's 
     goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward 
     another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.

     Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. They're
     stranded two stories up -- SITTING DUCKS.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Whatever happens -- DON'T LET GO!!

     In the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own 
     waist and hitched it around VICKI's belt. Before she has a 
     chance to protest, he LETS GO.

     VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the 
     way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.

     VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the 
     line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row 
     of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per 
     limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam 
     two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --

     -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.

     BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off 
     and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.

     The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and 
     fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black 
     INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.

     They move closer. And stop.

                              GOON I
               ... No blood.

                              GOON II
               Jesus.

                              GOON III
               Wait a minute.

     GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the 
     body. He examines THE BATMAN'S TUNIC... and RIPS IT OPEN.

                              GOON IV
               ... What is that?

                              GOON III
               Some kind of body armor.

                              GOON I
               He's human after all. -- Take that
               mask off.

     EXT. ROOFTOP - ON VICKI

     Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the 
     roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as 
     the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this 
     height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a 
     sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.

     ANGLE ON GOONS

     peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE 
     WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.

                              GOON I
               Well?... Who is this guy?

                              GOON II
               I dunno. You seen him before?

                              GOON III
               Maybe he's got some kind of I.D.

                              GOON IV
               Good idea. Let's check his wallet.

                              GOON I
               We'll worry about it later. Plug
               him.
                        (beat)
               In the head.

     GOON II draws his automatic. And at that very instant... A 
     FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.

     Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.

                              GOON III
               Goddam, it's the redhead!

     ON VICKI

     A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the 
     GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds 
     the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.

     ON BRUCE

     HIS EYES WINK OPEN.

     ON VICKI

     momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP 
     SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds 
     it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and 
     then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a 
     TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... 

     ON THE THUGS

     No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.

                              GOON II
               Did you hit her?

                              GOON I
               Who cares? Wax that freak.

     They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes 
     out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL 
     and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas 
     pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.

     In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body 
     THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage 
     can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.

     GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the 
     way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.

     Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the 
     alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at 
     BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.

     BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

     Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised 
     on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH 
     GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.

     ON VICKI

     She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons 
     everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, 
     grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet 
     her.

     VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S 
     FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the 
     roll, then drops it down her blouse.

     But BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens 
     her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the 
     alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.

     It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI 
     clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous 
     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.

     Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out 
     how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.

                              BATMAN
               ... Not even a 'thank you'?

                              VICKI
               Well -- I think you might consider
               thanking me. You were good as
               dead.

                              BATMAN
               That's because you lied about your
               weight.
                     (a long pause)
               Thank you.

     VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               I'll have to ask you for that film.

                              VICKI
               I just wanted to distract them. I
               wasn't trying to get a picture of
               you.

     BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The 
     telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.

                              BATMAN
               Please.

                              VICKI
               I won't let you have it.

     THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I know you can break my neck and
               take it. But the Joker's on that
               same roll. I --

                              BATMAN
               The Joker is a murderer. And you
               were as good as dead. So --

                              VICKI
               Look, I appreciate what you did for
               me. But this is my job. And I'm
               keeping those pictures.

                              BATMAN
               All right, here's a compromise. I'll
               develop the photos. You keep the
               Jokers and I'll keep the rest.

                              VICKI
               How do I know you won't keep them
               all?

                              BATMAN
               Because I'll take you with me.

     He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His 
     voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy 
     from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to 
     him.

     Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands 
     over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto
     shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Thank you, Vicki.

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you going to take me?

     No reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her 
     closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand 
     delicately along the line of her cheek... 

     ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS 
     into BATMAN's arms.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in 
     his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at 
     the BATMOBILE two blocks down.

     The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. 
     But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL 
     OVER the fearsome machine.

     BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON 
     CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the 
     Batmobile.

     He's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER
     from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.

                              BATMAN
               Shields open.

     EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

     TWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From 
     within they hear the tinny computerized voice:

                              COMPUTER
               Shields open.

     The steel plates begin to retract.

                              BATMAN (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
               Ignition.

                              COMPUTER
               Ignition.

     The stunned COPS gaze into the Batmobile's cockpit.

                              COP
               There's somebody in there!

     They TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO 
     LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE.

     COPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there 
     stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances 
     toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes 
     dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER.

     PANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     SIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless 
     BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting, 
     dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of 
     COP CARS in hot pursuit.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

     BATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and 
     approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms 
     and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING 
     HEADLIGHTS.

                              BATMAN
               STOP!

     BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN 
     and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.

     SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible 
     behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's 
     powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL 
     THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

     A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on 
     either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.

     INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

     VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.

                              VICKI
               ... How long have I been out?

                              BATMAN
               Quite a while. I took the scenic
               route.

                              VICKI
                     (gazing around her)
               Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.
               What's that?

     He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.

                              BATMAN
               Garage door.

     EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by 
     underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a 
     SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.

     Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds 
     later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.

     INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S 
     FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.

                              VICKI
               I meant to ask you. Up on the roof
               -- how did you know my name?

     BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               I'm serious. How did you know?

     No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and 
     SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL 
     LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.

     Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE 
     GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.

     ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL

     One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES 
     ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF 
     AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.

     The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL 
     -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- 
     winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.

     INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

     We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to 
     acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant 
     penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of 
     blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-
     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the 
     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.

     BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips 
     off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are 
     TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.

     VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and 
     picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to 
     examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.

                              VICKI
               What is this stuff? Kevlar?

                              BATMAN
               Better. It's not on the market yet.

                              VICKI
               It doesn't protect your head,
               though.

                              BATMAN
               That's why I wear a target on my
               chest.

     THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his 
     futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost 
     flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more 
     carefree, than some guys we could name... 

     ... like Bruce Wayne.

     VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping 
     at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.

                              VICKI
               How'd you find this place?

                              BATMAN
               Stumbled across it when I was a boy.

     VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses 
     overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               They don't come down here. They're
               afraid of the lights.

                              VICKI
               I don't like bats. Not that kind.

                              BATMAN
               They used to terrify me. But I
               forced myself to keep coming back,
               and --
                     (smiling)
               -- I guess I became the thing I
               feared the most. I'll do your photos
               now.

     He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the 
     kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the 
     roll.

     VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She 
     kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.

     She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair 
     of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated.

                              VICKI
               Who pays for all this?

                              BATMAN
               I have sponsors.

                              VICKI
               The computers?

                              BATMAN
               I'm running a check on the tainted
               products. There is a pattern.
               Beauty products. Personal hygiene.

                              VICKI
               No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll
               all be showing our true faces now.

     She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. 
     But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.

                              BATMAN
               I've tracked all the records. Every
               shipment, every warehouse, every
               loading dock. Nothing. No
               opportunities for tampering. Somehow
               the Joker is supplying tainted
               ingredients... at the source.

                              VICKI
               Wait. You can just tap into any
               corporate database you want?
               Anywhere?

                              BATMAN
               Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then
               I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos
               are ready.

     He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out 
     the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.

                              VICKI
               You could've killed him, you know.
               You could have killed the Joker.

                              BATMAN
               I had to save you, Vicki.
                     (turning to face her)
               Here you go. I think I'll let you
               keep the whole set.

     She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four 
     shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but 
     there's no clean angle on his face.

     VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Care for an autograph?

     He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her 
     with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B."

     Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is 
     trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto 
     roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind 
     him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.

                              VICKI
               ... Bruce?

     HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:

                              BATMAN
               Are you talking to me?

     He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a 
     SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw 
     on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Maybe we've had enough for one
               night. I'll take you home.

     Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the 
     BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his 
     utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Do you want to do it this time?

     VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as 
     he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.

                              BATMAN (cont.)
               Don't be afraid. I'm here.

     She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the 
     mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.

     FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-
     burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW 
     fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

     The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: 
     liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless 
     cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays 
     underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters 
     emerge from the opening of a hit musical.

     In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, 
     his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son 
     BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, 
     head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.

     THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the 
     sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts 
     an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.

     IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES 
     are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and 
     MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle 
     BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF 
     JOY. And then, without warning --

     A HANDGUN enters frame.

     The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps 
     protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, 
     begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.

     MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at 
     her throat.

     The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But 
     MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.

     The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.

     The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The 
     pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward 
     the sidewalk.

     A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.

     THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek 
     we cannot hear --

     -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.

     BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a 
     handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's 
     purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the 
     boy.

     Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his 
     parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny 
     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around 
     them.

     He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the 
     GUNMAN turns and runs.

     AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
     winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics 
     with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped 
     tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.

     There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away 
     from us. We can't see his face.

     And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's 
     hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name, 
     LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in 
     GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.

     But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. 
     Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A
     face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death... 
     and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare to
     violate this most private and terrible of moments.

     At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the 
     sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN 
     is smiling prettily at BRUCE.

     The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.

     A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding 
     white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING 
     SOUND cuts through the silence.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

     VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught. 
     The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her 
     hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.

     Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her 
     amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a 
     VOICE at the other end of the line.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki... ?

     INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S STUDY - NIGHT

     BRUCE at a big mahogany desk in his somber, book-lined 
     study. The room is dark but for a small table lamp.

                              BRUCE
               Vicki, I've been thinking about you.
                     (long pause)
               I know it's late. I'm sorry. I --
               Are you there?

     INTERCUT BRUCE AND VICKI

                              VICKI
               Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --

                              BRUCE
               I'm sorry about the way things went
               between us. I'd very much like to
               see you again.

                              VICKI
               Well, Bruce... I don't think... that
               would be possible.

                              BRUCE
               I wish you'd reconsider.
                     (groping)
               I didn't stand you up today. The
               museum was closed when I got there.

                              VICKI
               I, uh... 

     ON VICKI

     Her voice trails off. She's profoundly shaken. She knows.

                              BRUCE (V.O.)
               Vicki? Vi --

     She returns the receiver to its cradle.

     ON BRUCE

     He hears the click. His lips part slightly. He hangs up and 
     sits there at the desk, staring straight ahead.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     TOTAL DARKNESS. VICKI stands before the bathroom mirror. 
     She holds the OPENED ROLL OF TELEPHOTO SHOTS over the sink.

     Then she strikes a match. IGNITES the film. Drops it into 
     the sink, and -- with hollow eyes -- WATCHES IT BURN.

                                                 CUT TO:

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

     It's four in the morning. VICKI, wrapped in a bathrobe, 
     still shaky, pours her fifth cup of coffee. Sitting across 
     from her is a rumpled and stubbly ALEXANDER KNOX.

                              KNOX
               Vicki, it all fits. The stuff you're
               telling me -- the car, the equipment
               -- somebody's paying for it.

                              VICKI
               I just can't --

                              KNOX
               The FBI. You know who's got the FBI
               computer contract? Wayne
               Technologies.
                     (shaking his head)
               The guy's bats all right. He's bat
               shit crazy. This is gonna be the
               most incredible --

                              VICKI
               But he's not.

                              KNOX
               Not what?

                              VICKI
               He's not crazy.

     KNOX slaps his forehead in frustration, sprawls back in his 
     chair.

                              KNOX
               Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire
               here... who dresses up like a bat. He
               goes out at night and swings around
               -- in his cape -- on a rope.
                     (throwing up his hands)
               Okay. Maybe I'm crazy.

                              VICKI
               Allie... he wants to tell me.
               That's why he took me there. Because
               he's trying to tell me.

                              KNOX
               Gimme a break. If he wants to chat,
               he can talk to his car.

     The joke dies. VICKI stares dead ahead. KNOX looks on in 
     utter disbelief as it all comes into focus: he's lost her 
     loyalty. VICKI is in over her head with BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               He has to tell someone. And I'm the
               one. He's trying to tell me.

     KNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up 
     and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly:

                              KNOX
               Well, when he does you know my
               number.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

     CUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the
     Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline:

                       WAR OF THE FREAKS
             Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout

     In the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, 
     dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. 
     "WAR OF THE FREAKS" has been relegated to the lower right-
     hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing 
     news:

                       STOCK MARKET CRASHES
             Product Scare Drops Dow to 1100
             Biggest One-Day Decline in History

     INT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY

     BRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his 
     broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a 
     fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can 
     wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down.

                              BRUCE
               Don't sell. It won't last. We'll
               ride it out.

     With exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver 
     to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a 
     squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the 
     hook.

     INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     BRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is 
     shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. 
     The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY.

                              WAILING COLLEAGUE
               ... a nine-million-dollar bath!

     BRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the 
     door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

     A small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank 
     of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to 
     make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a 
     number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver:

                              BRUCE
                     (the familiar rasp)
               Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought
               I'd call and see how you're doing.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DAY

                              VICKI
                     (hesitantly)
               ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not
               going to talk to you unless we can
               discuss it.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - ON BRUCE

                              BRUCE
                     (a little smile)
               Who's this "Bruce"? Are you trying
               to make me jealous?

                              VICKI (V.O.)
                     (filter)
               I'm serious, Bruce. We have to --

     At this very moment, a DAZED FINANCIER enters from behind.

                              FINANCIER
               Hi, Bruce.

     BRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His 
     face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE 
     still squeaking on the other end of the line.

               Harvey, please. I mean --
                     (shaking his head)
               If your first official act as D.A.
               is to cut a deal with a

                              DENT
               Screw that, Ed. We've got a market
               panic of national proportions.

               Harvey's right. We've got the 300th
               anniversary gala coming up. The
               networks won't even send in a crew.

                              ADVISER
               Harvey, the police are working round
               the clock, the feds are coming in.

     COMMISSIONER GORDON reaches into his vest pocket for a 
     cigar. He clips the end off, lights it, takes a long 
     drag... and STARES GLUMLY at the floor.

               Cut the deal.

     INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

     The MAYOR sits impatiently at a long table, flanked by JIM

               past the appointed deadline, and
               still no word from --

     INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     REPORTERS cluster around a bank of four TV sets, each tuned 
     to a different station, all broadcasting from city Hall.

                              REPORTER I
               Look at 'em sweat. Can't wait for
               the next Gallup Poll.

                              REPORTER II
               Hey Knox, cheer up. It ain't the
               Batman but it's pretty choice.

     KNOX, who has recently taken up smoking, responds with a 
     grunt. SUDDEN HUBBUB from the ONLOOKERS as a wave of VIDEO 
     NOISE wipes half the screen away.

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     Split-screen. On one side is the MAYOR. On the other -- 
     sitting in a director's chair with a big yellow HAPPY-FACE 
     BACKDROP behind him -- is the JOKER, grinning fiendishly.

                              JOKER
               Joker here. Can we talk?

     The MAYOR fumbles for his prepared statement.

                              MAYOR
               "While this administration remains
               vehemently opposed to terrorism in
               any form, we are prepared to
               negotiate any reasonable demands
               which will guarantee the safety of
               the populace."

                              JOKER
               Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is
               kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having
               such a swell time, I just haven't
               thought any up.

     He shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But I'm a reasonable fella. If you
               want to make me an offer... 

     Panicked, the MAYOR and co. go into a quick huddle.

                              MAYOR
               All right, all right. Here's the
               deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of
               ten million dollars, payable in --

                              JOKER
               Ten million dollars. Ten million
               dollars.
                     (flying off the handle)
               Ten mi-- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just
               wiped out the stock market. I've
               cost you billions!
                     (petulantly)
               I want ten million and one.

                              MAYOR
               No, wait, please! We'll talk. Just
               tell us what you expect.

                              JOKER
               Goddammit, I expect to be treated
               like an ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!

     MORE VIDEO STATIC sweeps across the screen, pushing the 
     MAYOR clean out of frame. The JOKER leers at the camera.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I might just think up some demands.
               And I'm gonna talk to all my
               friends, and see what they want,
               too. And then maybe we'll get
               together -- have a little party --
               exchange presents.
                     (waving goodbye)
               Happy Birthday, Gotham.

     "The Shadow of Your Smile" comes up UNDERNEATH as the 
     JOKER's transmission ends and the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

     INT. GLOBE CITY ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     FRANTIC ACTIVITY as REPORTERS rush to their telephones and
     typewriters. KNOX strolls slowly back to his desk. He's 
     sitting on the biggest story of his career... and now, as 
     he realizes grimly, nobody knows or cares.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - DAY

     A tiny island in Gotham Harbor, homesite of LADY GOTHAM -- 
     the huge, newly restored stone statue that welcomes 
     incoming ships. Her upper half is draped in a huge TARP 
     prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this Sunday.

     At the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big 
     wooden platform, complete with microphones, amplifiers and 
     spotlights. They raise a gigantic BANNER which reads: 
     "GOTHAM CITY -- 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION."

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A TAXI pulls away from the wrought-iron gate at the 
     entrance to the estate. KNOX ambles up to a stone pillar, 
     glances up at a VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the gate, and 
     hits a BUZZER.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
                     (through loudspeaker)
               Yes?

                              KNOX
               Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               Mr. Wayne is out for the day.

                              KNOX
               Actually, I wanted to talk to
               Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne,
               would you?

     KNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. 
     Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN.

     INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY

     KNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big 
     leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him.

                              BRUCE
               I've been expecting to hear from
               you.

                              KNOX
               Well, that's how it is, chum. She
               tells me everything.

                              BRUCE
               What is it you want?

                              KNOX
               Simple. You know the score. One
               column -- and I can bring all this
               tumbling down. I can take you off
               the streets once and for all.
                        (a shaky pause)
               I want you to hang up the suit. And
               I want you to stay away from Vicki.

                              BRUCE
               I can't do that. Not while the
               Joker's still out there.

                              KNOX
               Then stay away from Vicki. That's
               all I want, man. I just want your
               word.

     BRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his 
     jacket for a cigarette.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               See, I don't know how it happened --
               she's a smart girl and you are an
               extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but
               she's in love with you.

                              BRUCE
               There's something I don't
               understand. If you've got the story,
               why haven't you printed it?

                              KNOX
               Because I --
                     (beat)
               Because she'd never speak to me
               again.

     KNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs 
     out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What
               have you got to offer? You gonna
               marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman?
                     (laughing bitterly)
               Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be
               Best Rodent?

     BRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even 
     put up an argument. The two of them sit there, not looking 
     at each other, as ALFRED appears in the doorway.

                              BRUCE
               Do you want a drink?

                              KNOX
               Yeah, a drink. "Civilized."  Man-to-
               man, right?

                              BRUCE
               Alfred, bring something for Mr.
               Knox. -- I'll have one too.

                                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

     The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and 
     Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE 
     CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in 
     everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, 
     representing the King in progressive stages of 
     deterioration.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK

     She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE.

                              VICKI
               ... So we just pretend none of this
               ever happened. We never met. We --
                     (frightened)
               You're going to get yourself killed,
               Bruce. You know that, don't you?

                              BRUCE
               It wouldn't matter much.

                              VICKI
               I don't understand it. You can do so
               much good for people. As Bruce
               Wayne.

     He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the 
     same argument with himself a thousand times.

                              BRUCE
               Money makes money, Vicki. The
               foundation runs itself. -- I'm
               extraneous to the process.

                              VICKI
               You're one man. You can't save
               everybody.

                              BRUCE
               What it I could save a handful?
               -- What if I could save one?

     VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands 
     up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:

                              VICKI
               Bruce, at the rate you're going, you
               can't even save yourself.

                              BRUCE
                     (staring right at her)
               Sometimes... I don't know if there's
               enough of me left to save.

     VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               Oh, God. I've got to have some
               coffee or something.

     A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. 
     Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.

     VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on 
     his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.

                              BRUCE
               Are you expecting anyone?

     She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Who's there?

     THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.

                              DELIVERY BOY
               Package tor Miss Vale.

                              BRUCE
               Set it down by the door. On the
               left-hand side.

     The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, 
     tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a 
     moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick 
     up the mysterious package.

     Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.

                              VICKI
               BRUCE!

     He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets 
     it down on the kitchen counter.

                              VICKI (cont.)
               It's just like the last time. He
               sent me a present before he --

                              BRUCE
               Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.

     As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds 
     his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a 
     LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then 
     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.

                              VICKI
               Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry
               it around with you.

                              BRUCE
               I feel naked without it.

     He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a 
     stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the 
     earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Not a bomb. But it could be rigged.
               Wait in the next room.

     He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then 
     SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.

     Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is 
     full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into 
     the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.

     In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.

     BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the 
     counter.

                              BRUCE
               ... They're wax.

     VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears.

                              VICKI
               "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make
               up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew.

                              BRUCE
                     (lost in thought)
               That does it. It's going to be this
               weekend.

     The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. 
     Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.

                              ALICIA
               I thought you ought to know -- he's
               coming for you... 

     ON BRUCE AND VICKI

     Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the 
     mouthpiece with one hand.

                              BRUCE
               Keep her on the line!

                              VICKI
               ... Where are you calling from?

     As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE 
     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP 
     COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up 
     a telecommunications program.

     A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.

                              VICKI
               I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --

                              BRUCE
               Finding out where she is.

                              VICKI
               How can you do that if she's already
               off the line?

                              BRUCE
               I've had an automatic tracer on this
               number ever since he tracked you to
               the museum.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

     MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding, 
     INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name -- 
     ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.

                              BRUCE
               Got it!

                              VICKI
               What now!

                              BRUCE
               Hang on. I have to leave a message.

     HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.

     INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

     ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key 
     to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on 
     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.

     The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the 
     elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas. 
     The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall 
     and march toward VICKI's apartment.

     INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER

     BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing 
     dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the 
     DOOR unlocking behind her.

     She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.

                              THUG I
               Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a
               fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have
               to --

     BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single 
     sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS 
     at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the 
     shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick 
     succession.

                              BRUCE
               There's a garage in this building?

     VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his 
     element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.

     She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK 
     NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is 
     full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I've got to take him out now.

     He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key 
     off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Pick an apartment and stay there.
               And listen: call the police. Give
               them that address. Every available
               man.

     He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a 
     dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.

     INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO 
     ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the 
     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.

     BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the 
     thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van, 
     his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING 
     DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.

     He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels 
     around in all his pockets, making a big show of having
     forgotten something.

                              BRUCE
               Oh, hell!

     The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the 
     elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that 
     something is amiss.

                              GOON
               Hey, boss, something's up. The
               elevator's working.

     INT. VAN - ON JOKER

     Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.

                              JOKER
               DAMMIT! You can't get good help
               these days. -- Let's move out.

     EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling 
     out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE. 
     He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL 
     LIGHT begins to flash.

     BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the 
     BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's 
     BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.

     EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

     The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual. 
     But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky, 
     staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.

     Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow 
     belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the 
     intersection on a ROPE.

     INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER

     The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on 
     either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:

                              JOKER
               Slow down, you maniac!

     EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. 
     His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just 
     about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING 
     MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands 
     directly behind him on the horse's back.

     BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. 
     The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through 
     the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.

     INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

     ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, 
     UNMARKED CARS are converging.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They 
     see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.

                              DRIVER
               Boss! Jesus! They've --

                              JOKER
               They'll be sorry. They'll be
               sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE!

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, 
     drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the 
     FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.

     EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING

     A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.

     INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT

     We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat 
     beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the 
     city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect 
     sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.

     EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT

     BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING 
     TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its 
     hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --

     -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, 
     neatly tied in string.

     BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick 
     salute -- and the BUG is gone.

     INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING

     The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the 
     southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are 
     everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for 
     the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.

                              JOKER
               MOVE! Can't you do something??

                              DRIVER
               It's some kind of detour. They're
               backed up for blocks!

     The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view 
     mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.

                              JOKER
               Oh my God. How does he do it... ?

     EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT

     THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET 
     ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around 
     the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, 
     RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first 
     opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO 
     GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.

     BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on 
     the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from 
     overhead.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING

     CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the 
     FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:

                              EMCEE
               -- the most spectacular, most death-
               defying aerial stunt ever devised.
               Tonight -- for the first time
               anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!

     He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying 
     side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the 
     twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING 
     GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled 
     red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other 
     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.

     EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL

     PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the 
     crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.

     On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He 
     lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly 
     against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- 
     driving it off the access road down into the brush, where 
     it nearly topples over sideways.

     ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS

     GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, 
     landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're 
     swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make 
     the return leap back to his own trapeze.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, 
     compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, 
     he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's 
     got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.

                              PILOT
               Ready to go, Dick?

                              DICK
               What's all the ruckus down there?

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding 
     trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its 
     side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: "DANGER - 
     FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD."

     The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.

                              JOKER
               Head for the truck!

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the 
     JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back 
     of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.

     EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER

     THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a 
     massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of 
     BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!

     THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an 
     expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.

                              JOKER
               I love fireworks!

     ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS

     LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past. 
     One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON 
     falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER 
     plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.

     MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and 
     weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a 
     wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER 
     veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously 
     close to the tall buildings along the avenue.

     INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT

     DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a 
     canvas strap. He watches helplessly as his MOTHER swings 
     into a POWER LINE and drops three stories to the pavement.

                              DICK
               NO! NOOOOOOOO!!!!

     His face is contorted with rage and pain. The PILOT 
     struggles desperately to right the copter, barely avoiding 
     a collision with the nearest building. And then -- before 
     THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED 
     OUT OF THE COPTER.

     ANGLE ON DICK

     With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A 
     FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a 
     nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down. 
     And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --

     -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended 
     target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead. He casually lifts his gun 
     and BLOWS A HOLE THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The blast just misses DICK. He sprawls flat, YANKS at the 
     chrome luggage rack on the roof of the van, and BREAKS OFF 
     A FOUR-FOOT SHAFT OF METAL.

     ANOTHER SHOT through the roof. DICK rolls forward, hoists 
     his chrome spear over the windshield.

     INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT

     SPLINTERED GLASS flies everywhere as DICK RAMS THE SHAFT 
     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. THE DRIVER dodges left and LOSES 
     CONTROL OF THE WHEEL.

     EXT. ROOF OF VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     The VAN careens wildly toward an OVERPASS. DICK rises up 
     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads 
     "DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE." He's about to get his head taken 
     off!

     ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across 
     the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over 
     a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet, 
     ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm 
     around his waist.

                              DICK
               LET ME GO! LET ME --

     THE JOKER steps casually out of the van. TWO GOONS with 
     MACHINE GUNS emerge behind him. PEDESTRIANS SCREAM as the 
     GOONS level their guns at the CROWD.

                              DICK (cont.)
               YOU PIECE OF -- YOU MOTHERF--

     DICK is kicking, screaming, clawing, biting. BATMAN has his 
     hands full restraining the kid.

                              JOKER
               Like your boyfriend. He's kinda
               hot.
                     (glowering at BATMAN)
               Hands off the belt.

                              BATMAN
               Take me. Let the boy go.

                              JOKER
               Gosh, I could kill you, but then
               you'd miss my party. And I'd be
               real, real sad if you couldn't make
               it.

                              BATMAN
               What are you talking about?

                              JOKER
               Batman! Don't you even recognize
               your old pal Jack? After all... 
                     (cackling insanely)
               You made me what I am today.

     BATMAN cocks his head in puzzlement as DISTANT SIRENS 
     BLARE. The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the 
     crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the 
     night.

     DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM. BATMAN throws him to 
     the street with a flying tackle. The boy is hysterical.

                              DICK
               HE KILLED MY PARENTS! HE KILLED
               MY --

     BATMAN flinches at the sound of the words. He reaches into 
     his belt and -- mercifully -- breaks a KNOCKOUT CAPSULE 
     under DICK's nose.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

     A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. 
     COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g.

                              REPORTER
               ... on a tip attributed to the
               mysterious Batman. The apartment was
               booby-trapped with the Joker's
               laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen
               dead.
                     (beat)
               Also found dead at the scene was
               Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model --

     CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of 
     BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other 
     screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty.

     We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, 
     showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER 
     and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate 
     transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads 
     into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, 
     as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE.
     Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY.

     Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase
     flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE 
     CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO.

     And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head 
     in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is
     responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly...
     he would just as soon be dead.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, 
     unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt.

     Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his 
     unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby.

                              DICK
               ... Where am I?

                              BRUCE
               My name is Bruce Wayne. You're
               welcome to stay here as long as you
               want.

     BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast 
     tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on 
     here?

     INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT 
     march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument.

                              DENT
               We'll send a team into Ace the
               moment the warrant comes through.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be ready when you do. Remember
               what happened at the apartment.

                              DENT
               All right, Bruce, what do you
               suggest?

                              BRUCE
               I suggest a nice big bomb.

                              DENT
               Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from
               Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws.

                              BRUCE
               Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel
               the anniversary celebration.

                              DENT
               We've told him we'll deal. What
               could he possibly have to gain by --

                              BRUCE
               Do you still think the Joker cares
               about money??

                              DENT
               I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I
               don't have access to all your
               expert sources.

     Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back 
     a moment, then turns down the hall.

     EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long 
     driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED 
     INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, 
     then climbs out and towels himself off.

     He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable 
     in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could 
     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

     An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray 
     bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and 
     tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's 
     costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway 
     behind him.

                              DICK
               ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride
               so I figured I'd hoof it.

                              BRUCE
               Sorry. I can't let you leave.

                              DICK
               You can't keep me here, man. That's
               kidnapping.

                              BRUCE
               If I let you leave, you'll do the
               same thing again. You'll go after
               the Joker... and you'll wind up dead.
                     (turning to go)

                              DICK
               Hey, man. Look at you. You're
               rich. You got everything you want.
               How do you know what's in my mind?

     BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are 
     filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling.

                              BRUCE
               I don't care what's in your mind.
               You're staying.

     BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the 
     kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding 
     speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up 
     spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.

     DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a 
     move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.

     A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with 
     a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of 
     motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's 
     chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

     ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up 
     curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle 
     royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom.

     INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. 
     He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. 
     Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... 
     who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie.

     A long, tense moment passes between them. Then:

                              DICK
               ... You're him.

     No reply from BRUCE. Their gazes lock. And suddenly... 

                              ALFRED (V.O.)
               FREEZE!

     DICK and BRUCE look around. The puny, mustachioed butler 
     stands in the doorway, feet spread in a Dirty Harry stance, 
     a .44 MAGNUM trained on DICK.

                              BRUCE
               It's all right, Alfred. Everything's
               under control.

                              ALFRED
               ... Very good, sir.

     ALFRED relaxes, musters his dignity, and turns to go.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

     CANNED APPLAUSE as THE JOKER marches out onto a makeshift 
     STAGE to give his QUARTERLY REPORT to the stockholders.

                              JOKER
               Thankya, thankya. Ladies and germs,
               I'm here to tell you... we have had
               one helluva quarter.

     He waves a pointer at three SALES CHARTS on portable 
     easels.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Panic's up. Terror's up. And fear --
               fear's gone straight through the
               roof. You guys should be proud --
               'cause I couldn'ta done it without
               each and every one of you!

     MORE CANNED APPLAUSE. The JOKER takes a bow.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I feel it's time to expand the
               Joker line. I was askin' myself,
               what are the products that every
               consumer wants most? And that's when
               it hit me: the water you drink, and
               the air you breathe! Huh? Bingo!
                     (strutting across stage)
               Now, some of you have your eye on
               the profit margin. You're thinkin':
               this boy's too ambitious. You
               don't approve. In fact, some of you
               have been talking about turning me
               in to the cops. Or knocking me off.

     He pauses. GLARES OUT at the audience. NO RESPONSE.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               But that's okay. I understand. Not
               everyone shares my eye for beauty.
               And just to show there's no hard
               feelings, I'm throwin' a little
               shindig tonight -- and you're all
               invited!

     THE CANNED APPLAUSE goes right off the meter.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               How 'bout it? IS EVERYBODY HAPPY??

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

     Familiar faces all around -- the major players of the 
     Gotham underworld. But despite the enormous twisted grins, 
     no one here is laughing or applauding. No one here is
     living. The JOKER is playing to a roomful of smiling 
     corpses.

     One of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.

                              JOKER
               Look at that, folks. We got 'em
               rolling in the aisles!

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - TOWARD DUSK

     VICKI lies in BRUCE's bed, under the covers, propped up on 
     the pillows. BRUCE is in his robe over by the window, 
     looking out at his estate.

                              BRUCE
               All this apparatus, Vicki... this
               house, and the money, and the
               power... it was never mine. It was
               something I inherited. Bruce Wayne
               was something I inherited.
                     (pause)
               All I ever hoped for was someone who
               could see through Bruce -- who could
               see me -- and not be frightened.

                              VICKI
               I'm not frightened of you, Bruce.
               I'm frightened for you.

                              BRUCE
               In all these years... why couldn't I
               see how it would turn out?

     He turns toward her. His face is ravaged with guilt. Now 
     she's truly afraid.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               I'm responsible, Vicki. If it wasn't
               for me, there'd be no Joker.

     INT. BATCAVE - EVENING

     TIGHT ON a tiny electronic device: two cylindrical steel 
     casings bracketed together, topped by a DIGITAL TIMER. 
     BRUCE makes a few adjustments with a jeweler's screwdriver, 
     hits a trigger, and watches the TIMER tick off seconds. 30. 
     29. 28. At 25 seconds, BRUCE kills the
     countdown and CLAMPS THE DEVICE into an empty packet on his 
     utility belt.

     He stands up wearily. He's in his bat-suit, minus the cape 
     and cowl. Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the 
     shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.

                              BRUCE
               Where's the boy?

                              ALFRED
               Upstairs. He's quite docile.

                              BRUCE
               I know that feeling. It won't last.

     BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks 
     on tremulously.

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               He's a long way ahead of where I was
               at his age.
                     (taking ALFRED's
                      shoulders)
               I want you to treat him just as if
               he were me. Promise.

                              ALFRED
               Yes, sir.

                              BRUCE
               He'll be taken care of financially.
               Beyond that... you know what to do.
               Don't let all this go to waste.

     Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to 
     speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long 
     circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne 
     Manor. On the third step he pauses:

                              BRUCE (cont.)
               Alfred? -- Thank you.

     As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies 
     himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.

     INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

     BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current 
     time is 7:09 PM.

     He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, 
     and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep, 
     regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later, 
     BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.

     Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.

     At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing 
     closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME, 
     twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of 
     R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.

     HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the 
     clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with 
     its grating electronic WHINE.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT

     The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage 
     point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out 
     the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up 
     the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights 
     off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's 
     forces.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge 
     shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with 
     a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot 
     outside.

                              DISPATCHER
               Boston, Philly: loading bay one.

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR 
     and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and 
     taking half the chain-link fence with it.

     In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the 
     BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A 
     ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the 
     factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole 
     in the door.

     INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and 
     SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are 
     everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and 
     PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

     CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass 
     dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and 
     COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER.

     INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

     BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It 
     doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving.

     TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny 
     voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command:

                              COMPUTER
               ... Detonate.

     A beat. Then: BLAM.

     INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing 
     to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS 
     dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps.

     All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky.

                              COP
                    Good Lord!

     EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking 
     lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. 
     For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then --

     All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble 
     and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT

     DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham 
     Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming 
     stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, 
     ready to be unveiled.

     THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of 
     Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-
     talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the 
     Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as 
     the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's 
     just another part of the celebration.

     At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a 
     microphone:

                              GOVERNOR GILROY
               As Governor of this great state, it
               is now my honor to unveil for you a
               very special lady -- a lady who
               stands tall for life and liberty --
               America's favorite lady... LADY
               GOTHAM!

     The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY 
     GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's 
     Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair 
     of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: 
     hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the 
     canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... 

     ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS
     WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!!

     Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE 
     SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS 
     ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: 
     the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the 
     stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD 
     stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES.

     And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS 
     GOING DARK.

     EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT

     QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different 
     points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a 
     PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE:

                              JOKER (V.O.)
               HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a
               little token of my esteem. HAVE
               FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME!

     INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S 
     HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY!

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to 
     earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS 
     try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another 
     in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT 
     DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb 
     out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.

     DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED 
     COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, 
     DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled 
     subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.

     On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a 
     field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless 
     against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.

     FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats 
     and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of 
     an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... 
     only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a 
     SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild 
     street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing
     her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her.

                              KNOX
               VICKI!

     VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's 
     wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A
               girl could get hurt this way.

                              VICKI
               Yeah. Deja vu.

                              KNOX
               What do you say? Let's head for the
               lights.

     In the distance, above the tops of the buildings, BEACONS 
     are sweeping the sky.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     Stationed all up and down Gotham's widest thoroughfare are
     huge portable SEARCHLIGHTS -- mounted on trucks with
     portable generators, unaffected by the power outage.

     On the money-covered sidewalks, TOTAL BEDLAM. But on the 
     street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if 
     nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block  
     intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS 
     BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical 
     figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.

     The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN -- 
     smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We 
     TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT... 

     ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom
     queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily 
     at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like 
     some demented parade marshal.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

     A desolate rural setting. UTTER SILENCE. Moonlight glints 
     on placid waters. We track in on a small sign bearing the 
     legend: "GOTHAM CITY RESERVOIR."

     Far off in the distance, HEADLIGHTS ARE APPROACHING.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - AERIAL SHOT - MOVING - NIGHT

     The THREE CARGO TRUCKS from Ace Chemical roll ominously 
     TOWARD THE RESERVOIR on their deadly mission. And then -- A 
     STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.

     THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift, 
     sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS 
     EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to 
     release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.

     EXT. ACCESS ROAD - A MOMENT LATER

     The BRIDGE EXPLODES, blocking the trucks' path to the 
     reservoir. PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and 
     wonder what to do next.

     They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a 
     sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they 
     HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE 
     TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and 
     destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

     ANGLE ON BATMAN

     in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the 
     wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham 
     skyline.

     EXT. GOTHAM STREET - NIGHT

     FRIGHTENED PEDESTRIANS race past OVERTURNED CARS. A PARADE 
     FLOAT, run aground on the sidewalk, begins to BURN.

     Above it, a damaged BALLOON -- the cartoon character 
     UNDERDOG -- is losing helium, warping and buckling in on 
     itself, sinking down gently toward the flames. Down the 
     street, KNOX'S FORD ESCORT is coming up fast.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI snapping photos out the window as UNDERDOG drifts 
     downward. FLAMES lick up at his belly -- and the cartoon 
     blimp EXPLODES.

                              KNOX
               So much for Underdog.

     THEN -- as they drive past -- A SECOND EXPLOSION. And all 
     at once the STREET IS FULL OF DEADLY GREENISH GAS!

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!! THE WINDOWS!!

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     The Ford Escort, windows up, swerves out of a THICK 
     SPREADING CLOUD of GREEN LAUGHING GAS -- threatening to 
     engulf the entire block!

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

                              KNOX
               WHAT HAPPENED?!?

     VICKI stares back at the green cloud. Turns. And sees, up 
     the street, THE JOKER'S PROCESSION: BALLOONS BY THE DOZEN!

                              VICKI
               Oh my God. Compressor tanks. He's
               got the balloons rigged with
               compressor tanks!!

                              KNOX
               Jesus Christ, the guy's a genius.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN, at the controls, gliding over the Gotham streets. 
     He looks down, sees a BILLOWING HAZE of DENSE GREEN FUMES. 
     At its periphery: LOOTERS reeling and staggering, falling 
     to the pavement, LAUGHING THEMSELVES TO DEATH.

     INT. FORD - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

     VICKI staring through the windshield. Overhead, an AIRCRAFT 
     streaks past... an aircraft with SCALLOPED BLACK BAT WINGS.

                              VICKI
               LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!
                     (frantically)
               Allie -- the balloons. We've got to
               find some way to tell him!

                              KNOX
               Great. How??

     They speed up the street toward the PARADE. SPOTLIGHTS 
     SHINE. Suddenly KNOX's eyes bug out. He SLAMS ON THE BRAKES 
     and SKIDS TO A HALT.

                              KNOX (cont.)
               COME ON!

     EXT. AVENUE - A SECOND LATER - NIGHT

     Before VICKI can speak, KNOX has grabbed a tire iron from 
     the back of the car and RACED OUT ONTO THE STREET. He 
     flings the TIRE IRON through a glass STOREFRONT.

     It's a COSTUME SHOP. In the window, MANNEQUINS dressed in 
     party costumes: Frankenstein. Ronald Reagan. And, that 
     current popular sensation... THE BATMAN.

     As VICKI catches up with him, KNOX drags the Batman dummy 
     out of the store window. RIPS OFF ITS BLACK CAPE. And 
     DASHES MANIACALLY UP THE SIDEWALK.

     Waving the cape, he VAULTS onto the back of a SPOTLIGHT 
     TRUCK. VICKI's face goes slack. Now she gets it.

                              KNOX
               GIMME A HAND UP HERE!

     VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of 
     the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel 
     assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... 

     ... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its 
     massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in 
     the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT.

     BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands.

     EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing 
     MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on 
     the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE 
     CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON.

     He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints 
     bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed 
     inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is 
     BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... 

     ... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! 
     The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE 
     TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring 
     through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to 
     the ground!

                              JOKER
               No... NOOOOO!!!

     ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON

     as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in 
     the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it 
     now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it 
     disperses harmlessly in the wind.

     EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the 
     rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds 
     it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; 
     hits a button repeatedly... 

     ... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The 
     damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a
     fit of pique.

     A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back 
     for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of 
     twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street.

     CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS 
     sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on 
     helplessly, in stunned disbelief.

     As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON 
     THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL.

                              JOKER
               There. There. -- GET 'EM!!

     ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK

     A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX 
     throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the 
     spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS.

                              KNOX
               GET THE CAR!

     The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the 
     Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps 
     off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of 
     rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction.

     GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT.

     INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

     KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL 
     LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally 
     exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done.

                              KNOX
               HOLY SHIT!!

                              VICKI
               You okay?

                              KNOX
               Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU
               SEE THAT?!

                              VICKI
                     (laughing wildly)
               God yes, Allie. I've gotta say --
               that was the ballsiest move I
               ever --

                              KNOX
                     (ecstatic)
               Holy shit. Holy --

     He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between 
     his lips -- and BURSTS.

                              VICKI
               ALLIE!!

     His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He 
     looks down in genuine bewilderment.

                              KNOX
               Jesus, Vicki.

     That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and 
     slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the 
     street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face.

     EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

     In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT

     THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, 
     past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the 
     one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear 
     through a CONCEALED HATCH.

     WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE 
     mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the 
     parade decorations. And one moment later... 

     A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a 
     burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, 
     leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops 
     low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he 
     streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-
     SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The 
     JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear
     him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.

     EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT

     The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips 
     through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and 
     BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN 
     stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's 
     clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.

     He's coming back for more!

     INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT

     The JOKER stares at a tiny BLIP on his radar screen.

                              JOKER
               He'll be back... he'll be back!!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING

     The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full 
     speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either 
     side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The 
     REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO 
     FLAME!

     The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the 
     tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps 
     the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF 
     THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of 
     the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.

     And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as 
     the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE 
     OPEN!

     INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

     BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in 
     the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS 
     groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and 
     the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE 
     SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!

     EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A 
     hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and 
     pulls himself up to the street.

     He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the 
     BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt 
     SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the 
     tunnel.

                              JOKER
               You do him. I'm outta here.

     The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They 
     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the 
     Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN... 
     inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.

     A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for 
     their guns, move in warily... 

                              VOICE
               Yo.

     The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of 
     motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and 
     green --

     -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only 
     one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a 
     red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.

     INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT

     BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS 
     and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot 
     or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the 
     plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.

     TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in 
     place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-
     like haze, A HAND extended toward him:

                              DICK
               HEY! COME ON!

     And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming 
     wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an 
     extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.

     EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in 
     agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath 
     him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.

                              DICK
               Now we're even, huh? Even up.

                              BATMAN
               How did you... 

                              DICK
               I hitched. MOVE IT!

     DICK drags BATMAN to safety as the Batwing ERUPTS INTO 
     FLAME behind them.

                              BATMAN
               The Joker. Is he --?

                              DICK
               Forget it. Relax.
                     (beat)
               ... He's mine now.

     DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.

                              BATMAN
               DICK!

     THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is 
     unendurable. His body has finally failed him.

     He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as 
     DICK races off with murder in his eyes.

     EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky, 
     piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is 
     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old 
     abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.

                              JOKER
               Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.

     HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER 
     forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, 
     hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

     Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained
     glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all 
     forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders 
     about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.

     DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear 
     pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS 
     at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS 
     DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.

     In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER 
     finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden 
     stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and 
     starts up.

     DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back 
     of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor, 
     unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA 
     WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.

     Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED 
     BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center 
     aisle of the old cathedral.

     INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

     A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the 
     wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.

     The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on 
     the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:

                              JOKER
               I'm in the belltower. Don't land.

     INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT

     A PILOT replies through his radio headset.

                              PILOT
               E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.

     The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.

     INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls 
     himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead.
     Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.

     Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps 
     against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his 
     utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule 
     back onto his dry, swollen tongue.

     Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and 
     TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten 
     wood of the belltower stairs.

     THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. 
     And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN 
     MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.

     It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the 
     fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, 
     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.

     Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. 
     His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN 
     INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.

     For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED 
     WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, 
     trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last 
     ounce of strength.

     The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. 
     BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.

     He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility 
     belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making 
     earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at 
     his side.

     THE BATMAN is out like a light.

     INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

     The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering 
     what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves 
     cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... 
     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.

                              JOKER
               ... Batman?

     No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little 
     snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of 
     his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on 
     his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS 
     BATMAN up into the belltower.

     He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. 
     The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- 
     pats his face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Batman? Batman?

     THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I thought you'd be more comfortable
               here in the belfry.
                     (chuckling to himself)
               Before I kill you I'd like to see
               who you are. Would that be okay?

     BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes 
     and reaches over to undo his cowl.

     BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The 
     JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, 
     moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Oh my, aren't we pretty.
                     (brightening suddenly)
               I know you! You're the rich boy!!

     The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps 
     his hands together in sheer glee.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               My goodness, what in the world made
               you do it? It must've been
               something pretty terrible!

     He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               You know, we should've sat down and
               had us a little heart-to-heart. I
               bet we would have got on famously.

                              BATMAN
               Mad... man... 

                              JOKER
               Well now, you're not exactly the
               picture of mental health, are you.

                              BATMAN
               ... Murderer... 

                              JOKER
               Bruce, we're both murderers. Think
               how many people you've killed by
               letting me live.

     A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his 
     helicopter approaching in the distance.

     BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his 
     utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.

     The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens 
     it gingerly.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               I have to do it now, Bruce, but it
               won't even hurt. Now relax. The
               bat's in his belfry, all's right
               with the world... 

     He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE 
     reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER 
     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               Why, Bruce... 

     Then he hears ticking.

     Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 
     0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.

     He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.

     BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch 
     convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

     BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.

                              JOKER (cont.)
               IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!

                              BRUCE
               No... sense... of humor?

     The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks 
     better of it and retracts his shaking hand.

     He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the 
     clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his 
     signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.

     The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on 
     the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down 
     the stairs in a frenzy.

     There are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and 
     counting.

     Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and 
     makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly 
     overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.

     EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT

     The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a 
     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD 
     LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost 
     losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures 
     wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.

     EXT. BELLTOWER

     A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves 
     -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of 
     the old cathedral --

     -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air 
     like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in
     blind uncomprehending fury --

     INT. BELLTOWER

     The JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, 
     cackles in mad triumph --

     -- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING 
     SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE 
     ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER --

     -- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER --

     -- and plunges into the night.

     TIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if 
     he makes his choice now.

     Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body 
     working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches 
     into position. Heaves it out into the darkness.

     It snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder.

     INT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT

     The CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just 
     enough to see what's going on.

                              CO-PILOT
               PULL UP!! PULL --

     EXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE

     It's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly 
     silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies 
     splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the 
     churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in 
     the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE 
     FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact.

     Sad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. 
     Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW.

     POV JOKER

     Looking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, 
     bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the 
     sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE

     It's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost 
     childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, 
     though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins 
     to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness 
     sets in.

                                               FADE THROUGH TO:

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.

                              ANCHORWOMAN
               As the details of the Joker's
               heinous plan become known, a city's
               gratitude goes out to the mysterious
               Batman. His whereabouts remain
               unknown, but Batman -- if you're
               alive -- if you're listening --
               thank you.

     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT 
     in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine 
     it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping 
     flowers.

                              VICKI
               I loved you too.

     As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she 
     gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.

     The headstone reads: "ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987."

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY

     ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.

                              ALFRED
               No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm
               afraid he's quite unreachable.

     INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

     The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized 
     SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.

     In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. 
     Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping 
     him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.

                              VICKI
               I don't know why I'm doing this. I
               half wish you'd stay a cripple.

                              BRUCE
               Ohhhh... you don't mean that.

                              VICKI
                     (grasping for words)
               I don't, but... I do. It's just... I
               love you, Bruce. I --

                              BRUCE
                     (taking her hand)
               Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or
               all of me?

     A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for 
     several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.

                              VICKI
               I guess you did it, didn't you. You
               saved everyone.
                     (pause)
               Almost.

     For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls 
     her over, takes her in a tight embrace.

                              BRUCE
               I don't know how to explain this so
               it makes sense... but you saved
               me.

     INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY

     DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and 
     looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets 
     his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation -- 
     LEAPS INTO THE VOID.

     His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE 
     AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the 
     rings on his way down.

     Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the 
     pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.

                                                 CUT TO:

     EXT. ROOFTOP - GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

     A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the 
     distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling 
     finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at 
     the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.

     A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his 
     RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN 
     SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through 
     the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a 
     BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.

     We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN 
     vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new 
     adventures. MUSIC BUILDS and we

                                                 FADE OUT.
