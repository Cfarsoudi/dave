FADE IN:

1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY

	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

	CREDITS  ROLL

	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913

	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY

	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

						PROFESSOR
					(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

						PROFESSOR
				"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

						BILLY
				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

						PROFESSOR
				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

						PROFESSOR
				Every five thousand years..

						BILLY
					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

						PRIEST
				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

						PROFESSOR
				"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.

						PROFESSOR
				"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

						PROFESSOR
				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

						PRIEST
				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

						PROFESSOR
				"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

						PRIEST (V.O.)
				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

						PROFESSOR
				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

						PRIEST
				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

						PROFESSOR
				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

						PROFESSOR
				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

						PROFESSOR
				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

						PROFESSOR
				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

						PRIEST
				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

						PRIEST
				Drink!

						PROFESSOR
				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

						PROFESSOR
				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

						PROFESSOR
				"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

						PROFESSOR
				Where is that boy? Billy!

7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor reads the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

						PROFESSOR
					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						PROFESSOR
				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

						PROFESSOR
					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						PRIEST
				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						PROFESSOR
					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

9	INT.  TUNNEL

	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM

	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						KOMMANDER
				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

						PRIEST
					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

						KOMMANDER
				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY

	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						PRIEST
					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						KOMMANDER
				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

						PRIEST
				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

						KOMMANDER
				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

						KOMMANDER
				When EVIL returns so shall we.

						PRIEST
					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						BILLY
				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						PRIEST
				No!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

						CLERK
				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						KOMMANDER
				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						KOMMANDER
				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY

	The huge ship's main hatch closes.

17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS

	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT

	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER

	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM

	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

						STAEDERT
				Don't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

						CAPTAIN
				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

						TECHNICIAN
				It's taking shape.

21	EXT.  SPACE

	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

						CAPTAIN
					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

						TECHNICIAN
				Hook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.

						STAEDERT
				...Send out a probe.

22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN

	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

						AIDE
				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						CAPTAIN
				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				Staedert, do you read me?

						STAEDERT
				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

						STAEDERT
				Perfect, Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

						STAEDERT
				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						PRESIDENT
				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.

						STAEDERT
				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						PRESIDENT
				Options.

						STAEDERT
				Wait or act.

						PRESIDENT
				Recommendations.

						STAEDERT
				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.

						PRESIDENT
				Gentlemen?

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				So do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod "yes"

						PRESIDENT
				All right, then! Staedert?

						PRIEST (O.S.)
				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						PRESIDENT
				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

						PRIEST
				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I'm listening.

						CORNELIUS
				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

						PRESIDENT
					(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

						CORNELIUS
				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

24	INT.  SPACESHIP

						TECHNICIAN
				The probe will attain its objective in
				five seconds.

	Staedert moves closer to the ship's window.

25	EXT.  SPACE.

	Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.

26	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						STAEDERT
				Mr. President, we're at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.

						PRESIDENT
				Your theory is interesting Father but
				I don't think we have time to go into it
				right now!

						CORNELIUS
				Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				That's exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
				fellow citizens! General?
				You may fire when ready.

27	INT.  SPACESHIP

						STAEDERT
					(cold) (to the CAPTAIN)
				..Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missile.
				Marker lights on the objective.

28	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.

29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					(consulting new data)
				Its structure has just solidified on the surface,
				 as if the object felt something.  If that's the case,
				we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

						CORNELIUS
				The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.

						CAPTAIN
				...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.

						PRESIDENT
					(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.

						STAEDERT
					(cold)
				I don't, Mr. President.

30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Staedert looks worried.

						STAEDERT
				Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
				shield protection.

						CAPTAIN
				Yes, Sir.

	The President is growing ever more worried.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you
				destroy it?

						STAEDERT
				I'm about to, Mr. President.

32	EXT.  SPACESHIP

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

						SCIENTIST
				The planet's diameter has greatly
				increased and it's moving toward the ship.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?

						STAEDERT
					(worried)
				...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

						CAPTAIN
				Nothing, General.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

						STAEDERT
					(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

33	INT.  APARTMENT

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						KORBEN
					(on the phone)
				Yeah?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

						KORBEN

					(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

						FINGER (V.O.)
				I love you too Major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.

						KORBEN
				I was talking to the cat.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

						KORBEN
				At least, the cat comes back.

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(ironical)
				You still pining for that two timing bitch.
				Forget her.
				There are a million women out there.

						KORBEN
				I don't want a million - I just want
				one.  A perfect one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Don't exist bud.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						KORBEN
				I just found a picture of you.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How do I look?

						KORBEN
				Like shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:
	WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				 Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.

						KORBEN
					(sighs)
				I don't need one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				I know how you drive.

						KORBEN
				Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a
				space fighter!!

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How many points you got left on your
				license?

						KORBEN
					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

						KORBEN
				Cheers!

34	INT.  HALL - DAY - OMIT

35	INT.  GARAGE - DAY - OMIT

36	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The office is emptied, only a few army officers remain.  An ancient
manuscript, Billy's drawings, sits in front of the President.  Cornelius
turns page after page, illustrating his
	point.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the President)
				We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs
				to adapt itself to our living conditions.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				And then?

						CORNELIUS
				And then it will be too late. The goal of
				evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life.
				For all eternity...Life upsets it.

	The President appears upset himself by this image.

						PRESIDENT
				Is there anything that can stop it?

						CORNELIUS
					(knowing)
				Yes..thank God..

37	EXT.  SPACE

	The Mondoshawan spaceship bursts through a star cluster and fills the
screen.

38	INT.  COCKPIT - OMIT

39	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The manuscript is open on the President's desk.. CLOSE ON:
	Billy's rendering of the Mondoshawan.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the President)
				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the
				Federated Territories, but they are peaceful...
				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

						CORNELIUS
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						PRESIDENT
				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

						CORNELIUS
				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

	The President's nerves quiver.

						CAPTAIN
				Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at
				the frontier requesting permission to enter
				 our territory.

						PRESIDENT
				I guess I should make a decision..

						CORNELIUS
				They are the only ones who can help..

						GENERAL
				Sir..the Mondoshawan do not belong to the
				federation. We do not know their intention..
				I must recommend a full trinuclear assault..

						PRESIDENT
					(yells)
				Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship
				like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is!
				I ask you for options you give me bullshit.
				Give them permission to enter our territories
				with my warmest regards.

						CORNELIUS
					(relieved)
				Thank you, Mr. President.

42	EXT.  SPACE / INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP

	The MONDOSHAWAN spaceship zips across the Federated Galaxy.
	But it is not alone: Two black warships seem to be dogging it.

43	INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  COCKPIT

	The MONDOSHAWANS have spotted the spacecraft chasing them.

						FIRST OFFICER
				Two non-identified ships approaching.

						CAPTAIN
				Must be the welcoming committee.

44	INT.  WARSHIP  COCKPIT

	A MANGALORE sits at the controls of the warship. His terrifying features
tell us what sort of welcome they can expect.  The pilot fires without
warning.

45	EXT.  SPACE / INT.	MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP

	The huge ship is badly hit and immediately swerves oft course.
	Panic aboard the MONDOSHAWAN ship.

46	INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP

						CAPTAIN
				We've been hit! General alert!!!

	Blast after blast hits the defenseless ship.

						CAPTAIN
				We're losing control! We have to land fast!

	The huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet, taking
hit after hit.

						CAPTAIN
				Send out a distress signal!!! Activate
				the emergency landing procedure!

	The huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed.

						FIRST OFFICER
				Impact in less than ten seconds!

	The red planet looms ever closer.

						CAPTAIN
				Time is of no importance...

	The ship crashes in a gigantic explosion.

46A	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	A thermo nuclear explosion fills a T.V. screen..Which Korben's cat
watches with interest.

	Korben is about to exit the apartment.

						KORBEN
				Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your
				mind. Bye sweetie..

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge
	gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face.

						MUGGER
				The cash man!

						KORBEN
				Been here long?

						MUGGER
				Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow
				you into tomorrow!

	Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.

						KORBEN
				Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.
				Neuro charged assault model?

						MUGGER
					(off balance)
				Uh..

						KORBEN
				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

						MUGGER
				It's not?

						KORBEN
				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

						MUGGER
				Thanks..

						KORBEN
				You're welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

						KORBEN
				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches
a nuclear holocaust on T.V.,  uninterrupted.

46B	INT.  KORBEN'S  GARAGE - DAY

	Korben enters his taxi.  A robotic voice greets him.

						VOICE
				Please enter your license..

	Korben complies, and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash.

						VOICE
				Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..

						KORBEN
				How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK?
				I didn't.

	Korben hits a button.  The garage door starts to open.

						VOICE
				Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

						KORBEN
				I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

						VOICE
				You have nine points left on your license..

						KORBEN
				Thanks for reminding me..

	As the garage door lifts, the Megalopolis that is New York City in the
23rd century comes into view.  Startling in it's height, and breath.

						VOICE
				Have a nice day..

	Korben lets the propulsion build.

						KORBEN
				Right..

	He lets the gear slip.  The taxi rockets off into the City.

49	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Cornelius collapses in a chair.

						CORNELIUS
				We are lost!

						GENERAL MUNRO
				Mr. President, the attack was launched by two
				unregistered warships.

						PRESIDENT
				Close all borders and declare a state of
				general alert.

						GENERAL MUNRO
				Yes, sir.

						PRESIDENT
					(to another OFFICER)
				Try to contact these Mondoshawans.  We
				owe them an explanation.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost, to himself)
				What are we going to do?

						PRESIDENT
				This is government business now.
				You ought to go home and get some
				rest, Father.

	The President motions to his guards to come and get Cornelius.

						PRESIDENT
				I promise to keep you informed.

	A weary Cornelius leaves the room with David's help.

						PRESIDENT
					(to the CAPTAIN)
			...Has the rescue team found any survivors?

50	EXT.  RED  PLANET - OMIT

52	INT.  LABORATORY  1ST DISTRICT  MANHATTAN - DAWN

	An arm, on a surgical cart, moves down the hall of the Nucleological
Center, the most sterile of environments.

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

						MUNRO
				This is all that survived?

						MACTILBURGH
				Actually only one cell survived..

						MUNRO
				Have you identified it?

						MACTILBURGH
				It's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

						MUNRO
				Talk English Doc.

						MACTILBURGH
				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

						MUNRO
				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						MACTILBURGH
				Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

						MACTILBURGH
					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

						MACTILBURGH
				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

						MUNRO
				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

						DOCTOR
				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

						MACTILBURGH
					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

						MUNRO
					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

						ASSISTANT
				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

						MACTILBURGH
					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

						ASSISTANT
				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

						MACTILBURGH
				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

						MACTILBURGH
					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

						MUNRO
				...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

						GIRL
					(very angry)
				Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra
				mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla.
				Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa!
				Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What's she saying?

						MACTILBURGH
					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

						MACTILBURGH
				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

						MUNRO
					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

						MACTILBURGH
					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

						GIRL
					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

						MUNRO
					(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

						CHIEF
				Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you
				go through the main ventilation!

55	INT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORY

	The girl moves along unable to see what's ahead of her. She comes to a
dead-end, a grill that leads outside.  She pushes it out and exits onto
the ledge.

56	EXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWN

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						CHIEF
					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

						COP
				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our
				instructions!

	The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.

57	INT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHT

						COP
					(in the car.)
				Christ! She dove off!

	In a panic, the COP makes a wrong turn.  The girl falls for several
seconds.
	She lands on the roof of a flying cab.

58	INT.  CAB - NIGHT

	Korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				You have just had an accident.
				Seven points have been temporarily
				removed...

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						VOICE / KORBEN
				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

						GIRL
				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

						KORBEN
					(lost)
				...'Scuse me?

	A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

						COP
					(over a loudspeaker)
				You have an unauthorized passenger in your
				vehicle.  We are going to arrest her.
				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

						KORBEN
					(obeying)
				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

						GIRL
					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can't resist her plea.

						KORBEN
				Don't put me in this position...
				I can't... I'm late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

						KORBEN
				Finger's gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						KORBEN
				I hate when people cry...
				I got no defense...

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAY

	Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. Except the
dead-end he's just come up against.

						GIRL
				Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

						KORBEN
				It there's one thing I don't need advice on,
				it's how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

						COP
				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET

	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

						KORBEN
				We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				...Priest...

						KORBEN
				You're not that bad... Come on we'll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

						KORBEN
				Vito Cornelius?

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

61	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door opens. Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms.

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

						CORNELIUS
					(tired)
				Weddings are one floor down.
				Congratulations.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				She's not my bride, she's my fare.
				She's looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

						CORNELIUS
					(curious)
				That's me.  But I don't know who she is...
				where did you find her?

						KORBEN
				She dropped in on me... holding this.

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

						CORNELIUS
					(staggered)
				The fifth element.

	He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks
around helpless.

						KORBEN
					(sighing)
				Finger's gonna kill me...

62	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

						CORNELIUS
					(with a start)
				Who are you?

						KORBEN
				I brought the girl remember?

						CORNELIUS
				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

						KORBEN
				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

						CORNELIUS
					(eyes riveted on her)
				He's a she!

						KORBEN
					(bemused)
				You noticed...

						CORNELIUS
					(face shining)
				There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

						KORBEN
				So you do know her.

						CORNELIUS
				Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						KORBEN
				Perfect...

63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

						CORNELIUS
				It's a miracle!!!

						DAVID
					(worried)
				What is?

						CORNELIUS
					(babbling crazily)
				I can't wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT

	Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

						GIRL
					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				I'm sorry, it's just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

						KORBEN
				You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven't been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll
				need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

						DAVID
				Father, will you please explain what's
				going on?

						CORNELIUS
				The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,
				in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!

66	INT.  LIVING ROOM

						KORBEN
				...What's your name?

						GIRL
					(after a moment)
				Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
				Ekbat De Sebat.

						KORBEN
					(polite)
				Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

						GIRL
				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

						KORBEN
				That's... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

						CORNELIUS
				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

						LEELOO
				Corn-i-Lius?

						CORNELIUS
					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

						DAVID
				Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

						CORNELIUS
				Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

						KORBEN
				They all like this in your family, father?

						CORNELIUS
				She's an exception..

						CORNELIUS
				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

						KORBEN
				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

						KORBEN
				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she's better?

						CORNELIUS
				She's fine, really..don't you worry..
				just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

						KORBEN
				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

						CORNELIUS
				It means, "Never without my permission".

						KORBEN
				That's what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

						KORBEN
				...Thanks.

	Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

66B	INT.. KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in
the air.

						KORBEN
				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

				Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

						FINGER (V.O.)

				So, just how big was this fare?

						KORBEN

68	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

						DAVID
				What's she doing?

						CORNELIUS
				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She's been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						CORNELIUS
				What're you laughing about?

						LEELOO
					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						DAVID
					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						CORNELIUS
					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

						LEELOO
				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

						CORNELIUS
				The case was stolen?

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

	CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

						RIGHT ARM
				Excuse me sir, the council is worried about
				the economy heating up.  They wondered if
				it would be possible to fire 500...

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

						ZORG
				Fire 1000.

						RIGHT ARM
				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						RIGHT ARM
				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

70	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						CORNELIUS
				There was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art
				dealer ... Asking all these questions about
				the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think
				anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so
				bad with names...

						DAVID
					(to Leeloo, timid)
				I didn't know your size.

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

						DAVID
				They really made her...

						CORNELIUS
				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

						LEELOO
					(to David)
				Domo danko!

	David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo?  The Stones...
				We must get them back.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						LEELOO
				Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

						CORNELIUS
				You know exactly where they are!

71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

						ZORG
					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

						ZORG
				...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

						ZORG
				That's better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You're warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

						ZORG
				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

						ZORG
					(very fast)
				...It's light... the handle's adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

						ZORG
				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it's even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

						ZORG
				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

						ZORG
					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

						ZORG
				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT's hands.

						ZORG
				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

						ZORG
				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

72	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

						CORNELIUS
					(astonished)
				What do you mean empty?

73	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

						ZORG
				Alright..I've got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

74	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

						CORNELIUS
					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She's supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She's looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

						LEELOO
				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

						DAVID

	Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

						CORNELIUS
				...We're saved!

75	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

						ZORG
				I'm fucked!

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						AKNOT
				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

						ZORG
					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT's men grow edgy.

						AKNOT
					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

						ZORG
					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

						ZORG
				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
				ZERO CRATES!!!
					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we're outta here.

	AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

						AKNOT
					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

76	EXT.  OUTSIDE  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.

						ZORG
				I don't like warriors!  They're too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.
				Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when
				he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.

77	INT.  HALLWAY  ZORG'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

	The warriors have all taken a weapon. One of them inspects his ZF1.  He
turns it over and notices the little red button. He presses it.

	Korben is finishing a Thai meal, cooked by a Thai on his mini restaurant
anchored at the window. The cat eats next to Korben, contented.

						KORBEN
				So you forgive me?

	The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  Korben ignores it.

						THAI
				Not going to open?

						KORBEN
				I've never gotten a message that wasn't
				bad news.

						THAI
				How someone strong like you scared from
				a message? Is good news I sure!

						KORBEN
				The last two messages I got?  The first one
				was from my wife telling me she was leaving!
				And the second was from my lawyer telling me
				he was leaving too... with my wife.

						THAI
				You right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				Grandfather say: "It never rain every day."
				This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

	Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						THAI
				...You're fired. Oh!

	Korben smiles at him.

						KORBEN
				At least I won lunch.

						THAI
				Good philosophy..see good in bad..
				I like..I prepare number one dessert..
				special for you and pussy..

	The cat meows.

	Leeloo is polishing of' an immense pile of dessert as David bangs away at

						DAVID
				I got it!  Everything  here we need to

				and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!

						CORNELIUS
				Good work, my son.  Now all we need is
				a way to get there.

	The doorbell rings.

						CORNELIUS
				I'll get it.  Finish your work my son.

	Cornelius opens to Right Arm with armed escort.

						ZORG
				Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...
				nice to see you again

						CORNELIUS
				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						ZORG
				I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you're going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

						CORNELIUS
				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

						ZORG
				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

						CORNELIUS
				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

						ZORG
				Why?  What's wrong with me?

						CORNELIUS
				...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

						ZORG
				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

						ZORG
				...would you like a drink?

						CORNELIUS
				No thank you.

						ZORG
				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						ZORG
				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

						ZORG
				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						ZORG
				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

						CORNELIUS
				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						ZORG
				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

						ZORG
				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

						CORNELIUS
				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						ZORG
				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

						CORNELIUS
					(mocking)
				Where's the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

						CORNELIUS
				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

						ZORG
				You saved my life... So, I'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

						CORNELIUS
				You are a monster, Zorg!

						ZORG
					(complimented)
				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

						ZORG
				...Torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but I want
				those Stones. You have an hour.

	Right Arm salutes and hurries out of the office.

				The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the

	C.U. The most disgusting dessert ever made.  Korben looks at it shimmying
on a plate as the Thai serves it to him proudly.

						THAI
				Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

	Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The
phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Saved by the bell.

	Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

						KORBEN
				...Hello?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in
				this stinking City!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Hi Ma...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You wouldn't even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				Know something? The whole thing makes
				me sick!

	The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second
match..

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

						KORBEN
					(to the Thai)
				Go on... This is gonna take a while!

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

						KORBEN
				Other than that... You all right?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				...And now you're making fun of me?
				I'm warning you! If you don't take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, I'll
				never forgive you!!

	The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking
				about?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I get it! You want to make me beg,
				is that it?

						KORBEN
				All I want is an explanation! I just got
				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

						KORBEN
				Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.
				Someone would have notified me.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				They've been blaring out your name on
				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

						KORBEN
				Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

						MUNRO
					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						KORBEN
				What mission?

						MUNRO
				To save the world.

						KORBEN
				Where have I heard this song before?

						MUNRO
				You're to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions'?

						KORBEN
					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

						MUNRO
				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						MUNRO
				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						KORBEN
				And the third one?

						MUNRO
				You're the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

						MUNRO
				Don't you open your messages?

						KORBEN
				I've had enough good news for today

						MUNRO
					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

						KORBEN
				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

						MUNRO
				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

						KORBEN
					(sarcastic)
				You couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						MUNRO
				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						KORBEN
				I'm not going.

						MUNRO
				Why not?

						KORBEN
				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL

	Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the
card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	The doorbell rings.

						KORBEN
				...Scuse me.

	Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.
	Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

						KORBEN
				...Shit!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

						KORBEN
				It's my wife.

						MUNRO
				I thought you were divorced.

						KORBEN
				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates
				you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's
hands.

						KORBEN
				...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
				It'll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I'll be back.

						MUNRO
				Three of us will never fit in there!

						KORBEN
					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by Cornelius.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				I suppose that means "Hi" ?

						CORNELIUS
				I'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

						KORBEN
				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						CORNELIUS
				We're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

						KORBEN
				What kind of mission?

						CORNELIUS
					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

						KORBEN
					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

						CORNELIUS
				Of course.

						KORBEN
				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry..

						VOICE
				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING

	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

						VOICE
				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

						CORNELIUS
				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

						CORNELIUS
				What are you doing?

						KORBEN
				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

						VOICE
				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it
transparent.

						COP 1
				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

						COP 1
					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

						KORBEN
				No, I'm a meat popsicle.

						COP 3
					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

						COP 1
				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

						NEIGHBOR
				Fuck you!!

113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

						KORBEN
				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

114	INT.  HALL

	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

						COP
				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

						COP (O.S.)
				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

						RIGHT ARM
					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

						RIGHT ARM
				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's
name.

						RIGHT ARM
				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

						ZORG
				Don't come back without the Stones.

116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

						KORBEN
				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						KORBEN
			..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						LEELOO
					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

						KORBEN
				Uh..you're welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

						KORBEN
				Coffee!  That's what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						KORBEN
				With some honey!  You'll see, honey's
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						KORBEN
				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

						KORBEN
					(nervously)
				I've got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

						KORBEN
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						KORBEN
				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

						KORBEN
				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

						KORBEN
				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						KORBEN
				It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						KORBEN
				You hear that?

						LEELOO
					(licking)
				Cornelius..

						KORBEN
				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						LEELOO
				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

						KORBEN
				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

						LEELOO
					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

						CORNELIUS
				No, I'm not proud of myself...
				But we don't have the luxury of choice.

117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

118	INT.  SHED

	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

						AKANIT
				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

						AKNOT
				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He'll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

119	INT.  KORBEN'S APARTMENT  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

						KORBEN
				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

						KORBEN
				Yeah?

						MOTHER (V.O)
				Have you pulled yourself together?

						KORBEN
				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

						KORBEN
				I'll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

						CORNELIUS
				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

						CORNELIUS
				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

						LEELOO
				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

						CORNELIUS
				I can't pretend to be your husband...
				David's in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE

	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

						KORBEN
					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

						DAVID
					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

						KORBEN
					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David's fake ID.

						KORBEN
				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(looking at Leeloo's ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

						KORBEN
				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

						LEELOO
					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

						KORBEN
				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I'll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It's our honeymoon. We're going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

	ANGLE ON:

	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

						COP
					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she's also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

	ANGLE ON:

	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

						NEIGHBOR
					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that's me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

						NEIGHBOR
				We'll be right back ... we're gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

						ROBOT
				The same?

						CORNELIUS
				Yeah...

						DAVID (V.O.)
				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

						CORNELIUS
				Where's Leeloo?

						DAVID
				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

						CORNELIUS
				It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...
				It's my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

						CORNELIUS
				Here's the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

						NEIGHBOR
					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

						COP
					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

	ANGLE ON:

	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE

	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

123	INT.  HALL

	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

						STEWARDESS
				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

						KORBEN
				Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.
				I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

						STEWARDESS
				Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc
				Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

						KORBEN
					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ.

						LOC RHOD
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

						KORBEN
					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

						LOC RHOD
				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						LOC RHOD
				...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  And from what I'm looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						KORBEN
				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						LOC RHOD
				Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

						LOC RHOD
				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						LOC RHOD
				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your
				voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

						KORBEN
					(pissed)
				I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						LOC RHOD
					(petrified)
				Crystal.

124	INT.  AIRPORT

	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	Right Arm's smile shatters.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I'm the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

						RIGHT ARM
				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						RIGHT ARM
					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that's all... I'm calm now.

125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY

	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she
is doing.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				I'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I've got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

						LEELOO
				Love...

						KORBEN
				Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

						LEELOO
					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						KORBEN
				Sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						LEELOO
					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						KORBEN
				Know what? On that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

	ANGLE ON:

	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	ANGLE ON:

						LEELOO
					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

						KORBEN
				Finished what?

						LEELOO
				Learning language.

						KORBEN
				Which one?

						LEELOO
				All 900.

	Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

						KORBEN
				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						LEELOO
					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						KORBEN
				I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how
				to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

						LEELOO
				Apipoussan!

						KORBEN
				Apipoussan?

						LEELOO
				Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

						KORBEN
					(fumbling)
				Uh...

						LEELOO
				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						STEWARDESS
				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						STEWARDESS 2
				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						LOC RHOD
					(hugging her)
				I don't want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

						STEWARDESS 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

						LOC RHOD
				Now you're talking!

126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

						COPILOT
					(on the radio)
				Molecular axis authorization. Vector 130.
				Destination Fhloston.

	Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

						STEWARDESS 1
				Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.

						PILOT
					(checking her out)
				Thanks, Miss.

	The Stewardess leaves with a smile.  A red light flashes on the vast
control panel.

						MECHANIC
				Tell the ground crew we've got parasites
				in the landing gear.

127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY

	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

						RIGHT ARM
				Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				I'm listening.

						RIGHT ARM
				The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!
				He took my place.

						ZORG
				This is a joke, right?

129	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

						LOC RHOD
				No!! I swear to God! I've never been this
				sincere with a human before!

130 EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
	into the opening.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				You're fueled and ready to go.
				Have a nice flight.

131	INT.  SHUTTLE

						PILOT
					(to copilot)
				Everything ready for liftoff?

132	INT.  CABIN

						STEWARDESS

				No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...

133	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE / AIRPORT  HALL

						ZORG
				I cannot hear you. We have a bad
				connection here.  What's your number?

	Right Arm reads off the phone number.

						RIGHT ARM
				278-500-645-321

						ZORG
				I'll call you back.

134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

135	INT.  SHUTTLE

	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

						COPILOT
				Anti static pressure?

						MECHANIC
				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly.

137	EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

138	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	A keyboard slowly appears in front of Zorg.

						ZORG
					(typing the number)
				278... 500...

139	SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

	The pilot gradually turns the engines up.

						COPILOT
				10 seconds...

						PILOT
				Power increase.

	- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that's about to
lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

						ZORG
				3... 2... 1...

	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

						PILOT
				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

	- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and
everything else   within 60 feet.

140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

141	INT.  COCKPIT

	In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

						COPILOT
					(relaxing)
				Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up.

142	INT.  CABIN

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben's.

143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT

	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


144	EXT.  SPACE

	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

145	INT.  SPACESHIP

	In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

						TECHNICIAN
				All right! We're finally getting something!

146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

						PRESIDENT
				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE

	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						ZORG
				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						SHADOW
				Am I disturbing you?

						ZORG
				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW'S breathing is awesome.

						SHADOW
				...Not far, now.

						ZORG
				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

						SHADOW
				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

						ZORG
				Got it.

						SHADOW
				How's our deal coming along?

						ZORG
					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						SHADOW
				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						ZORG
				The Stones will be here. I'll see to it
				personally!

						SHADOW
				...I can't wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE

	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

						STEWARDESS
				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

						STEWARDESS
					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

151	INT.  COCKPIT

	A blinking light goes on.

						PILOT
				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben's box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She's not there.

153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area.

						PILOT
				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

157	INT.  CABIN

	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle.

						KORBEN
					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I'm trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL

	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

						HOSTESS
					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

						HOST
					(playful)
				If you don't have the code you can't
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

						LOC RHOD
					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don't leave me here
				alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

						KORBEN
				I'll take you to the bar, after that,
				you're on your own.

						LOC RHOD
					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

						KORBEN
				I don't think this is a good time...

						LOC RHOD
				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

						KORBEN
					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

						LOC RHOD
				I didn't have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn't
				hear me...

159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

						KORBEN
				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn't bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

						HOSTESS
					(looking him over)
				Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				You little sleaze bag!

						KORBEN
				...Ma???

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				Don't you ever ask me for another thing
				in my life again, you've killed your

	Korben drops into an armchair and sighs. His eyes go to the ceiling.

	The Chief of Police has Cornelius in front of him, handcuffed.

				The Diva's ship is coming in.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				I want maximum security.

						FOG
				Yes. Sir!

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(to Cornelius)
				OK, let's hear it.

						CORNELIUS
				Where was I?

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(bored)
				...You open the door. There's a cabby with
				a girl in his arms.

	FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.
They hold up a THIRD COP.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

						BEAT-UP COP
				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...
				with green eyes.

	Cornelius perks up.

						CORNELIUS
				And the smile of an angel?

	They all turn to look at him.

						CORNELIUS
					(to Chief)
				May I speak to you alone.

167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				One last time...

	The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
					(nodding)
				Miss.

	Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

168	EXT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

						FOG
				Hello, I'm head of security.
				Everything is in order. You can...

	The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

						FOG
				...make yourselves at home safely.
				If you need anything...give it a knock!

169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks
both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet.

170	INT.  KORBEN'S  STATEROOM

	Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						KORBEN
				Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days
				vacation and I'll be damned if I'm
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	The door RINGS.

						KORBEN
				...Hang on, it's the door. No!
				I told you I didn't bring anybody!
				I'm all alone... as usual!

	Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(to his mother)
				...I'll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

						KORBEN
				Here we go again...

						LEELOO
					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						KORBEN
				You get that off the screen?

						LEELOO
				Yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

						KORBEN
				You noticed..

						LEELOO
				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

						KORBEN
				Where you going?

						LEELOO
				I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's
				the matter?... Do I look bad?

						KORBEN
				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

						LEELOO
				Do you know how this works?

	Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						KORBEN
				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

						KORBEN
				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

						LEELOO
				And you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

						KORBEN
				It's difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

						KORBEN
				Army issue. I'm sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

						LEELOO
					(seething)
				You're nothing but a... a...

						KORBEN
				The words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. I won't
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben my man what's happening here?
				Who's the chick? What's the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

						KORBEN
				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

	Loc Rhod and Korben enter what turns out to be a replica of the Garnier
Opera in Paris.  A hostess escorts them to their seats.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

	ANGLE ON:

	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

						BABY RAY
				...to who?

						LOC RHOD
					(moving down the aisle)
				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king
				of laserball and the best paid player in the League.
					(shakes hands as he goes by)
				...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet
				whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.
				"I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she
				recently confessed to me. She will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

						AKANIT
				It's showtime!

178	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

179	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindbergh and his staff, including Munro, sit at the desk.
Speakers appear.

180	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

						MANAGER
					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Flowers for the Diva.

						MANAGER
				She's allergic to flowers!!!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				There's champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

						CORNELIUS
				...My God!

184	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

						CAPTAIN
				Commander, I have a ship with a main
				malfunction. He requests permission to

						COMMANDER
				Did you check out his registration number?

				Everything's in order.

						COMMANDER
				Put him in the docking garage and inform
				the police.

185	INT.  COCKPIT  ZFX200 - NIGHT

						CAPTAIN (V.O.)
				Permission granted. Dock 575.  You have
				an hour. Will that be enough time'?

	Zorg sits at the controls.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				More than enough.

186	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The ZFX approaches Fhloston.

187	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window.

	FLASHBACK:

	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

188	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

						CORNELIUS
					(in a panic)
				Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I'm going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

						MANGALORE
				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

						LEELOO
				(smiling)
			Apipoulai!

191	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo.

	INTERCUT':

192	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL.

	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

193	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

194	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

195	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL

	Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

196	INT.  ROOM

	Akanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

						MANGALORE
				They were waiting for us! It was an
				ambush!

						AKANIT
				If it's war they want it's war they'll get!
				Enact the Final Plan!

	All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

197	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there
holding a ZF1.

						ZORG
				My compliments, little lady!
				...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
				I couldn't have done it any better myself!
					(sharply)
				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

						ZORG
				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

198	INT.	AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

199	INT.  SUITE

	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

						ZORG
					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can't hide...

200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief's head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

						AKANIT
				Nobody move! We're taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

						CORNELIUS
					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

201	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

						MANGALORE 1
				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

203	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

204	INT.  CONCERT HALL

	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON

	Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

						ZORG
				You want something done, do it yourself!

206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

						LOC RHOD
					(voice low, panicked)
				They're hideous. They've got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

207	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

						PRESIDENT
				Send a battalion out immediately!

208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

						DIVA
				Don't worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

						KORBEN
				I've never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

						DIVA
					(weak)
				You're a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

						KORBEN
				Who?

						DIVA
				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo... is... she's...

						DIVA
				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she's the only one
				who knows how to use them.

						KORBEN
					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

209	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

						DIVA
				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						KORBEN
				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

						DIVA
				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						KORBEN
					(uncomfortable)
				I'll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

						DIVA
				Do you love her?

						KORBEN
				I... I don't know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						DIVA
				I don't have time... I need to know.

						KORBEN
				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

						DIVA
				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva's eyes close.

211	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

						KORBEN
				Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!
				You're not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

213	INT.  SPACESHIP

	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It's empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

						DIVA
					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

						MANGALORE 2
				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						KORBEN
				...In me?

	He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						LOC RHOD
				Don't you think we'd better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						MANGALORE
				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						KORBEN
				That's it... I've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						KORBEN
				You don't do what I say... I'll waste
				you myself. Got it?

						LOC RHOD
				Got it...

215	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

216	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

						AKANIT
				What's the situation in the hall?

217	INT.  HALL

	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

						MUGGER
					(into walkie-talkie)
				There's no more resistance.
				Everything's under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

						KORBEN
				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

						LOC RHOD
				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

						LOC RHOD
				It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

						PRINCESS AACHEN
					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

						LOC RHOD
				GET OFF MY BACK!

	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

						KORBEN
				Toss me the balls!

						BABY RAY
					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

						KORBEN
				The balls for Christ's sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

						EMPEROR JAPHET
				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

						KORBEN
				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

						EMPEROR
				I'd say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb's up.

						LOC RHOD
				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

						FOG
				Thanks for your help.

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

						KORBEN
				Six to the left. One to the right.

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

						CORNELIUS
				You're probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

						KORBEN
				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo's in trouble?

						KORBEN
				When is she not in trouble?

						CORNELIUS
				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(loudly)
				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

						LEELOO
				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

						KORBEN
				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what're these numbers clicking
				by?

						CORNELIUS
				Probably the time remaining before it

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

						LOC RHOD
					(weak smile)
				You're just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.
				There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

	A general alarm goes off.  Loc Rhod is crushed.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is a Type A alert. For security reasons

						KORBEN
				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

						KORBEN
				It's the latest model.. I've never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

235	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben's hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						KORBEN
				Don't worry, I'm here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						KORBEN
				Just relax. I've got the Stones.
				Everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(falling to pieces)
				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of
				your time here?

						KORBEN
					(to Leeloo)
				I'll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						ZORG
				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

						ZORG
				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special
				Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

	Korben doesn't reply.

						ZORG
				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

						ZORG
				...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

						KORBEN
				Don't you know how to count.
				It's not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

						KORBEN
				One! That's for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

						KORBEN
				Two! That's for firing me! Three!
				That's for pushing around a priest!
				And the rest is for what you did to
				my wife!

	Korben pummels him mercilessly.

	Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3
minutes.

						KORBEN

the lines to shreds.

	Loc Rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship.

little.

				I'm so very sad.

				Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't

						LEELOO
				Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs...
				Money...
				Everything you create is used to destroy...

						KORBEN
				I told you not to read all that crap!

						LEELOO
				Protect life... Until death.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

				His name's Mambo, I think.

				So now what's the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

						PRESIDENT
				There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter

				no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

						KORBEN
				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

						SCIENTIST
				If its speed remains constant... in an

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

						DAVID
				You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

						CORNELIUS
				Later, David! Later!
				There's not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

261	INT.  CHAPEL

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray

	Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off
lowering the altar like a service elevator.

	The altar descends amid rocky walls.

				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

265	INT.  TEMPLE

	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

						CORNELIUS
					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

						KORBEN
				Don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

						CORNELIUS
				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don't have the reference book.
				I've never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

						KORBEN
				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

						LOC RHOD
				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

						KORBEN
				No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				There's no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

						KORBEN
				And you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						CORNELIUS
				That's what I'm saying.

				The wind blows... the fire burns...

						KORBEN
				I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking
				about the Stones.

						LEELOO
				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

						KORBEN
				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

						KORBEN
				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

						LOC RHOD

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

						LOC RHOD
				...we'll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

						LOC RHOD
				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

						KORBEN
				What did you say? What did you do?

						LOC RHOD
				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
				nothing!

						KORBEN
				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						LOC RHOD
				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

	Nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				Is that all?

						LOC RHOD
				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.

						KORBEN
				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

						KORBEN
				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

						LOC RHOD
					(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

						KORBEN
				Don't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						CORNELIUS
				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! If you don't get on with the

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

				You're right but there are lots of good

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is
everywhere.

						LEELOO
				Tell me...

						KORBEN
				I love you...

	Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

	CUT TO:

278b	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

279 INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				Now you're allowed to kiss me.

	- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

280	EXT.  SPACE

	The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
	Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

281	INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

	President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead-

						SCIENTIST
				The planet seems to have stopped at...
				62 miles from impact.

282	INT.  CHAPEL

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

	Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

						LOC RHOD
				This guy is a killer with the babes.
				I knew it from the moment I laid eyes
				on him.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on
kissing.

283	INT.  LABORATORY

	We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  The President enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						MUNRO
				Mr. President, let me introduce you to
				Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						MACTILBURGH
				It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
					(beaming)
				Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

						MACTILBURGH
				They were so tired from their ordeal that
				we put them in the reactor this morning..

						PRESIDENT
				I have 19 more meetings after this one
				Professor..

						PROFESSOR
				Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.

						AIDE
				We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.

						MACTILBURGH
				I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				Mr. President.

	The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						AIDE
				No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...

						PRESIDENT
				Who is it?

						AIDE
				Some woman... claims she's Korben's
				mother...

						PRESIDENT
				Give it here...

	The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

						PRESIDENT
				Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.
				On behalf of the entire Federation,
				I would like to thank...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Don't pull that crap with me, Finger...
				I'd recognize that trash can voice of
				yours in a dark alley during a rain storm.
				You tell that worthless no account son
				of mine he should plotz for the way he's
				ignored his mother... when I think of all I
				sacrificed for him...

284	EXT.  NEW YORK

	Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.

	PAN slowly across Manhattan.
	Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.

     --------------------------------------------------------------

     SCREEN BLACK

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 People were always asking me, did I
                 know Tyler Durden.

     FADE IN:

     INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

     TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With a gun barrel between your teeth,
                 you only speak in vowels.

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I can't think of anything.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With my tongue, I can feel the
                 rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
                 controlled demolition thing and I
                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 That old saying, how you always hurt
                 the one you love, well, it works both
                 way.

     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We have front row seats for this
                 Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
                 Demolitions Committee of Project
                 Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
                 of ten buildings with blasting
                 gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
                 charges will blow base charges, and
                 those buildings will be reduced to
                 smoldering rubble.  I know this
                 because Tyler knows this.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplised.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
                 really about Marla Singer.

     PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE
     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is
     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob had bitch tits.

     PULL BACK to wide on...

     INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This was a support group for men with
                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie
                 slobbering all over me was Bob.

                             BOB
                 We're still men.

                             JACK
                 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
                 developed bitch tits because his
                 testosterone was too high and his
                 body upped the estrogen.  That was
                 where my head fit -- into his huge,
                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the
                 way we think of God's as big.

                             BOB
                 They're gonna have to open my pec's
                 again to drain the fluid.

     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

                             BOB
                 Okay.  You cry now.

     Jack looks at Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For six months.  I could not sleep.

     INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup
     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With insomnia, nothing is real.
                 Everything is far away.  Everything
                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.
     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

     Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the
     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When deep space exploration ramps up,
                 it will be corporations that name
                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.
                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet
                 Starbucks.

     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks
     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 I'm going to need you out-of-town a
                 little more this week.  We've got
                 some "red-flags" to cover.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It must've been Tuesday.  he was
                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

                             JACK
                       (listless management speak)
                 You want me to de-prioritize my
                 current reports until you advise of
                 a status upgrade?

                             BOSS
                 You need to make these your primary
                 "action items."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was full of pep.  Must've had his
                 grande latte enema.

                             BOSS
                 Here are your flight coupons.  Call
                 me from the road if there are any
                 snags.  Your itinerary...

     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.

     INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT

     Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips
     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy
     magazines and other catalogs nearby.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like everyone else, I had become a
                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika
                 Pekkari slip covers.

     Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

     MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I saw something like clever coffee
                 table sin the shape of a yin and
                 yang, I had to have it.

     PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
                 Strinne green stripe pattern...

     INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN

     The armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
                 environmentally-friendly unbleached
                 paper.

     The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even the Vild hall clock of
                 galvanized steel, resting on the
                 Klipsk shelving unit.

     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I would flip through catalogs and
                 wonder, "What kind of dining set
                 defines me as a person?"  We used to
                 read pornography.  Now it was the
                 Horchow Collection.

     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still
     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.

                             JACK
                 No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that
                 sounds nice.  Apricot.

     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had it all.  Even the glass dishes
                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
                 proof they were crafted by the
                 honest, simple, hard-working
                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically
     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
     a butter knife to eat it.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who
     studies him with bemusement.

                             INTERN
                 No, you can't die of insomnia.

                             JACK
                 Maybe I died already.  Look at my
                 face.

                             INTERN
                 You need to lighten up.

                             JACK
                 Can't you give me something?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
                 Seconals.

                             INTERN
                       (overlapping w/ above)
                 You need healthy, natural sleep.
                 Chew valerian root and get some more
                 exercise.

     The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...

     INT. HALLWAY

     The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.

                             JACK
                 I'm in pain.

                             INTERN
                       (facetious)
                 You want to see pain?  Swing by First
                 Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the
                 guys with testicular cancer.  That's
                 pain.

     The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack heads for the front door.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER
     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

                             SPEAKER
                 I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and
                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and
                 one boy.  We never could agree on
                 anything.

     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to
     lighten the mood.

                             SPEAKER
                 Well, she had her first child a month
                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...
                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,
                 because she deserves...

     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,
     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.

                             LEADER
                 Everyone, let's thank Thomas for
                 sharing himself with us.

     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:

                             EVERYONE
                       (in unison)
                 Thank you, Thomas.

                             LEADER
                 I look around this room and I see a
                 lot of courage.  And it gives me
                 strength.  We give each other
                 strength.

     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
     Jack squirms in his seat.

                             LEADER
                 It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's
                 follow Thomas's example and open
                 ourselves.

     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
     Jack stands, uncomfortable.

                             LEADER
                 Can everyone find a partner?

     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,
     shuffling his feet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The big moosie, his eyes already
                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
                 together, invisible steps.

     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You
                 know that chest expansion program you
                 see on TV?  That was his idea.

                             BOB
                 ...using steroids.  I was a juicer.
                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm
                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
                 won't return my calls...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Strangers with this kind of honesty
                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder
     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of
     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.

                             BOB
                 Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then... something happened.  I was
                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
                 and complete.

     Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens
     his arms around Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I found freedom.  Losing all hope was
                 freedom.

     Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET
     MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Babies don't sleep this well.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies sound asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became addicted.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and
     women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to
     cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I didn't say anything, people
                 assumed the worst.  They cried
                 harder.  I cried harder.

     INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES
     CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Tonight, we're going to open the
                 green door -- the heart chakra...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
                 to cancer or parasites; I was the
                 warm little center that the life of
                 this world crowded around.

                             LEADER
                 ...And you open the door and you
                 step inside.  We're inside our
                 hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a
                 white ball of healing light.  That's
                 right, the pain itself is a ball of
                 healing light.

     Jack, eyes closed, is silent...

                             LEADER
                 It moves over your body, healing you.
                 Keep this going and step forward,
                 through the back door of the room.
                 Where does it lead?  To your cave.
                 Step forward into your cave.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...

                             LEADER'S VOICE
                 That's right.  You're going deeper
                 into your cave.  And you're going to
                 find your power animal...

     Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks
     his head to signal Jack forward.

                             PENGUIN
                 Slide.

     The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He
     walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every evening I died and every
                 evening I was born again.  Resurrected.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob loved me because he thought my
                 testicles were removed too.  Being
                 there, my face against his tits,
                 ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

     MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and
     big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, she ruined everything.

     Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.

                             MARLA
                 This is cancer, right?

     Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER

     Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE
     as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.
     She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...
                 did not have testicular cancer.  She
                 was a liar.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while
     a member speaks.  Jack spies on her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She had no diseases at all.  I had
                 seen her at my melanoma Monday night
                 group ...

     INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down
     the row are turned toward her, incredulous...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood
                 parasites group Thursdays.

     Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my
                 tuberculosis Friday night.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

     Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the
     shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes,
     catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie
                 reflected my lie.

     Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down
     her cheeks.  She wipes at them.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack
     exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I
                 couldn't cry.  So, once again, I
                 could not sleep.

     Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATER

     Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling
     IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No, I just can't believe that card is
                 declined -- Okay, okay, let me give
                 you a different card number.

     Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card
     and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Next group, after guided meditation,
                 after we open our chakras, when it's
                 time to hug, I'm going to grab that
                 little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her
                 arms against her sides and say...

     INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     CLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.

                             JACK
                 Marla, you liar, you big tourist.  I
                 need this.  Get out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When you have insomnia, you're never
                 really asleep and you're never really
                 awake.  I hadn't slept in four days...

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  People
     are chattering with each other.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- But, in here, in everyone, there's
                 the squint of a five-day headache.
                 Yet they forced themselves to be
                 positive.  They never said
                 "parasite;" they said "agent."  They
                 always talked about getting better.

                             LEADER
                 Okay, everyone.

     Everyone sits in chairs.  Jack catches sight of Marla.

                             LEADER
                 To open tonight's communion, Chloe
                 would like to say a few words.

     Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin
     stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  She wears a
     head bondage.  She clears her throat.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way
                 Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look
                 if you made it smile and walk around
                 a party being extra nice to everyone.

                             CHLOE
                 Well, I'm still here -- but I don't
                 know for how long.  That's as much
                 certainty as anyone can give me.  but
                 I've got some good news -- I no
                 longer have any fear of death.

     APPLAUSE from around the room.

                             CHLOE
                 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
                 No one will have sex with me.  I'm so
                 close to the end and all I want is to
                 get laid for the last time.  I have
                 pornographic movies in my apartment,
                 and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

     The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Thank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's
                 thank Chloe.

                             EVERYONE
                 Thank you, Chloe.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

                             LEADER
                 Now, you're standing at the entrance
                 to your cave.  You step inside your
                 cave and you walk.  Keep walking.

     Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I did have a tumor, I'd name it
                 Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on
                 the roof of your mouth that would
                 heal if only you could stop tonguing
                 it, but you can't.

                             LEADER
                 Now, find your power animal.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette.  Marla cocks her head,
     indicating whe wants him to --

                             MARLA
                 Slide.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING

     Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke
     rings with her eyes closed.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

     Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.

                             LEADER
                 Pick someone special to you tonight.

     Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him.
     He tries to smile.  She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.

                             CHLOE
                 Hello, Mr. Tayler.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I never gave my real name at support
                 groups.

                             JACK
                 Hi, Chloe.

                             CHLOE
                 We've never actually talked.

     Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation.  Jack, in
     a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

                             JACK
                 You look good.  You ... look ... like
                 a pirate.

     Chloe laughs, a little too much.  Jack squeezes out a laugh.
     Then he sees Marla, off by herself.  Someone heads for her.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me, I have to...

     Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla.
     Chloe watches him go.

     STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her.
     He whispers into her ear.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             MARLA
                 Sure.

                             JACK
                 I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You
                 aren't dying.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy
                 way, we're all dying.  But you're not
                 dying the way Chloe is dying.

                             LEADER
                 Tell the other person how you feel.

                             JACK
                 You're a tourist.  I saw you at
                 melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular
                 cancer.

                             MARLA
                 And I saw you practicing this...

                             JACK
                 Practicing what?

                             MARLA
                 Telling me off.  Is it going as well
                 as you hoped... ?
                       (reads his nametag)
                 "... Mr. Taylor."

                             JACK
                 I'll expose you.

                             MARLA
                 Go ahead.  I'll expose you.

                             LEADER
                 Share yourself completely.

     Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were
     crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?

                             MARLA
                 It's cheaper than a movie, and
                 there's free coffee.

                             JACK
                 These are my groups.  I was here
                 first.  I've been coming for a year.

                             MARLA
                 A year?  How'd you manage that?

                             JACK
                 Anyone who might've noticed either
                 died or recovered and never came back.

                             LEADER
                 Let yourself cry.

                             MARLA
                 Why do you do it?

                             JACK
                 I... I don't know.  I guess... when
                 people think you're dying, they
                 really listen, instead...

                             MARLA
                 -- Instead of just waiting for their
                 turn to speak.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

     Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.

                             LEADER
                 Quietly, now.  Share with each other.

     Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.

                             JACK
                       (warning)
                 It becomes an addiction.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

     Jack sighs, then pulls back.

                             JACK
                 Look, I can't cry with a faker
                 present.

                             MARLA
                 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not
                 my problem.

                             JACK
                 Please.  Can't we do something... ?

     Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her.

                             LEADER
                 Now, the closing prayer.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

                             JACK
                 We'll split up the week.  You can
                 have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --

                             MARLA
                 You take tuberculosis.  My smoking
                 doesn't go over at all.

                             JACK
                 I think testicular cancer should be
                 no contest.

                             MARLA
                 Well, technically, I have more of a
                 right to be there than you.  You
                 still have your balls.

                             JACK
                 You're kidding.

                             MARLA
                 I don't know -- am I?

     Jack follow Marla into...

     INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She
     takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.

                             MARLA
                 I'll take the parasites.

                             JACK
                 You can't have both parasites.  You
                 can take blood parasites --

                             MARLA
                 I want brain parasites.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and
                 organic brain dementia --

                             MARLA
                 I want that.

                             JACK
                 You can't have the whole brain!

                             MARLA
                 So far, you have four and I only have
                 two!

                             JACK
                 Then, take blood parasites.  It's
                 yours.  Now we each have three.

     Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack follows, bewildered.

                             JACK
                 You... left half your clothes.

     HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with
     traffic barreling down.

     Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS
     BLARING.  Jack dashes, following...

     INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

     Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK
     sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.

                             JACK
                 You're selling those?

     Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain.

                             MARLA
                       (for the Clerk to hear)
                 Yes, I'm selling some chothes.

     The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.

                             MARLA
                 So, we each have three -- that's six.
                 What about the seventh day?  I want
                 ascending bowel cancer.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The girl had done her homework.

                             JACK
                 I want ascending bowel cancer.

     The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.

                             MARLA
                 That's your favorite, too?  Tried to
                 slip it by me, eh?

                             JACK
                 We'll split it.  You get it the first
                 and third Sunday of the month.

                             MARLA
                 Deal.

     They shake.  Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.

                             MARLA
                 Looks like this is goodbye.

                             JACK
                 Let's not make a big thing out of it.

     She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.

                             MARLA
                 How's this for not making a big thing?

     Jack watches her go.  A moment, then he follows after...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

                             JACK
                 Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
                 numbers?

                             MARLA
                 Should we?

                             JACK
                 In case we want to switch nights.

                             MARLA
                 I suppose.

     Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
     back, hands it to her.  She takes the pen, grabs his hand
     and writes her number on his palm.  She walks into the
     street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.  She turns,
     holds up the card.

                             MARLA
                 It doesn't have your name.  Who are
                 you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.
                 Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you
                 give each night?

     Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
     Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  A BUS
     moves into view, obscuring her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met Marla Singer.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     The plane touches down; the cabin BUMPS.  Jack's eyes open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at O'Hare.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at SeaTac.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

     The rear of a CRASHED CAR sticks up by the side of the road.
     Jack stands, marking on a clipboard.  The SUN SETS behind.

     INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Jack stands at a gate counter.  An ATTENDANT smiles at him.

                             ATTENDANT
                 Check-in for that flight doesn't
                 begin for another two hours, Sir.

     Jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and
     looks at an overhanging CLOCK.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an
                 hour, gain an hour.  This is your
                 life, and it's ending one minute at
                 a time.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack's eyes snap open as the plane LANDS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Air Harbor
                 International.

     INT. AIRPORT WALKWAY

     Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet.  He
     watches PEOPLE MOVING PAST on the opposite conveyor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you wake up at a different time
                 and in a different place, could you
                 wake up as a different person?

     Jack misses seeing TYLER on the opposite conveyor belt.
     They pass each other.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN.  As they have idle
     CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's tray.  An ATTENDANT'S
     HANDS set coffee down with a small container of cream.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.
                 Single-serving sugar, single-serving
                 cream, single pat of butter.

                                                      CUT TO:

     HANDS place a dinner tray down.

                 Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth in the MIRROR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-
                 serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

     Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He
     moves out of the bathroom into...

     MAIN ROOM

     Jack sits on the bed.  He turns on the TV.  It's tuned to
     the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a
     large BANQUET ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels
     something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN.  They chat.  Jack turns to
     look at his food, takes a bite.  He turns back and it's...

     --a BALD MAN next to him, talking.  Jack takes another bite,
     turns back and it's...

     --a BUSINESSMAN next to him.  Jack takes another bite, turns
     back, and it's...

     --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people I meet on each flight --
                 they're single-serving friends.
                 Between take-off and landing, we have
                 our time together, but that's all we
                 get.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING

     Jack's eyes snap open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Logan.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

     Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a
     WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it
     and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is
                 to apply the formula.  It's a story
                 problem.

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 Here's where the infant went through
                 the windshield.  Three points.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A new car built by my company leaves
                 somewhere traveling at 60 miles per
                 hour.  The rear differential locks up.

                             TECHNICIAN #2
                 The teenager's braces around the
                 backseat ashtray would make a good
                 "anti-smoking" ad.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The car crashes and burns with
                 everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we
                 initiate a recall?

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 The father must've been huge.  See
                 how the fat burnt into the driver's
                 seat with his polyester shirt?  Very
                 "modern art."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Take the number of vehicles in the
                 field, (A), and multiply it by the
                 probable rate of failure, (B), then
                 multiply the result by the average
                 out-of-court settlement, (C).  A
                 times B times C equals X...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY

     Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.

                             JACK
                 If X is less than the cost of a
                 recall, we don't do one.

                             BUSISNESS WOMAN
                 Are there a lot of these kinds of
                 accidents?

                             JACK
                 Oh, you wouldn't believe.

                             BUSINESS WOMAN
                 ... Which... car company do you work
                 for?

                             JACK
                 A major one.

     Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a
     PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every time the plane banked too
                 sharply on take-off or landing, I
                 prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
                 collision -- anything.

     Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane
     BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,
                 not even bad breath.

     The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are
     sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering
     wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Life insurance pays off triple if you
                 die on a business trip.

     Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.

     DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE.
     EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their
     seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...

                             VOICE
                 There are three ways to make napalm.
                 One, mix equal parts of gasoline and
                 frozen orange juice...

     Jack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler
     continues:

                             TYLER
                 Two, equal parts gasoline and diet
                 cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter
                 in gasoline until the mixture is
                 thick.

                             JACK
                 Pardon me?

     Tyler turns to Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met --

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it.

                             TYLER
                 You know why they have oxygen masks
                 on planes?

                             JACK
                 No, supply oxygen?

                             TYLER
                 Oxygen gets you high.  In a
                 catastrophic emergency, we're taking
                 giant, panicked breaths...

     Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback,
     hands it to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Suddenly, we become euphoic and
                 docile.  We accept our fate.

     Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.

                             TYLER
                 Emergency water landing, 600 miles
                 per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as
                 Hindu cows.

     Jack laughs.

                             JACK
                 What do you do, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 What do you want me to do?

                             JACK
                 I mean -- for a living.

                             TYLER
                 Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's
                 what you do." -- And be a smug little
                 shit about it?

     Jack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him
     and lifts a BRIEFCASE.

                             TYLER
                 You have a kind of sick desperation
                 in your laugh.

     Jack points to his own briefcase.

                             JACK
                 We have the same briefcase.

     Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Open it.

     Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the
     lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.

                             TYLER
                 Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
                       (reaches in his pocket)
                 I make and sell soap...

     Tyler hands Jack his card.  "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."

                             TYLER
                 If you were to add nitric acid to the
                 soap-making process, one would get
                 nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one
                 could blow up the world, if one were
                 so inclined.

     Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares.

                             JACK
                 Tyler, you are by far the most
                 interesting "single-serving" friend
                 I've ever met.

     Tyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be
     witty, leans closer to Tyler.

                             JACK
                 You see, when you travel, everything
                 is small, self-contained--

                             TYLER
                 The spork.  I get it.  You're very
                 clever.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 How's that working out for you?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Being clever.

                             JACK
                       (thrown)
                 Well, uh... great.

                             TYLER
                 Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

     Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.

                             TYLER
                 ... As I squeeze past, do I give you
                 the ass or the crotch?

     Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...

                             TYLER
                 We are defined by the choices we make.

     Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the
     curtain aside and sits in an empty seat.  Jack watches.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How I came to live with Tyler is:
                 airlines have this policy about
                 vibrating luggage.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT

     Utterly empty of baggage.  No people except for Jack and a
     SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN.  The Security TFM, smirking, holds
     a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (to Jack)
                 Throwers don't worry about ticking.
                 Modern bombs don't tick.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?  "Throwers?"

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Baggage handlers.  But when a
                 suitcase vibrates, the throwers have
                 to call the police.

                             JACK
                 My suitcase was vibrating?

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Nine time out of ten, it's an
                 electric razor.  But, every once in
                 a while ...
                       (whispers)
                 ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy
                 not to imply ownership in the event
                 of a dildo.  We use the indefinite
                 aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your
                 dildo."

     Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing
     his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE.
     Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS
     OUT.  jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM.

     In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the
     convertible, SCREAMING.

                             JACK
                       (to Security TFM)
                 I had everything in that bag.  My
                 C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (into phone)
                 Yeah, uh huh... yeah?
                       (pause, still on phone)
                 Oh...

     EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY

     A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete.  SECURITY PERSONNEL
     keep their distance.  KABOOM!  The suitcase explodes.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING

     The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 I'm terribly sorry.

     The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form.  Jack snatches it,
     disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 You know the industry slang for
                 "Flight Attendant?"  "Air Mattress."

     INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

     Along a residential street.  Jack looks ahead, sees a tall,
     grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Home was a condo on the fifteenth
                 floor of a filing cabinet for widows
                 and young professionals.  The walls
                 were solid concrete.  A foot of
                 concrete is important when your next-
                 door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
                 and has to watch game shows at full
                 volume...

     The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the
     building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-
     OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS
     and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris
                 that used to be your furniture and
                 personal effects blows out your floor-
                 to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
                 into the night.

     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

     Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the
     Cabbie money.  The taxi pulls away.  Jack starts toward the
     building.  He pushes through the fray of people, into the...

     INT. LOBBY

     The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his
     head.  Jack starts for the elevator.

                             DOORMAN
                 There's nothing up there.

     Jack presses the button.  The Doorman moves next to him.

                             DOORMAN
                 You can't go into the unit.  Police
                 orders.

     The elevator doors open.  Jack hesitates.  The doors close.
     Jack heads out the lobby doors.  The Doorman follows...

     EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE
     from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part
     of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.  His feet CRUNCH glass.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How embarrassing.

                             DOORMAN
                 Do you have somebody you can call?

     Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.  He
     reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone
     number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE

     Hissing.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The police would later tell me that
                 the pilot light might have gone
                 out... letting out just a little bit
                 of gas.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack gets to a PAYPHONE.  The Doorman follows, watching him.

                             DOORMAN
                 Lots of young people try to impress
                 the world and buy too many things.

     Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter.  He looks at
     Marla's number a long moment.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM

     The SOUND of the HISS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The gas could have slowly filled the
                 condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet
                 with high ceilings, for days and days.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs
     out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone
     numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.

                             DOORMAN
                 Many young people feel trapped and
                 desperate.

     INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then, the refrigerator's compressor
                 could have clicked on...

     Click.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from
     the Filofax.  Jack catches it.

                             DOORMAN
                 If you don't know what you want, you
                 end up with a lot you don't.

     The Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
                 you why I called him.

     Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It
     RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the
     phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the
                 plane.  We had the same briefcase.
                 I'm... you know, the clever guy.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 I just called a second ago.  There
                 was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick
                 up my phone.  What's up?

                             JACK
                 Well... let me see... here's the
                 thing...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.

                             JACK
                 You buy furniture.  You tell
                 yourself: this is the last sofa I'll
                 ever need.  No matter what else
                 happens, I've got the sofa issue
                 handled.  Then, the right set of
                 dishes.  The right dinette.

                             TYLER
                 This is how we fill up our lives.

     Tyler lights a cigarette.

                             JACK
                 I guess so.

                             TYLER
                 And, now it's gone.

                             JACK
                 All gone.

     Tyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  A woman could cut
                 off your penis while you're asleep
                 and toss it out the window of a
                 moving car.

                             JACK
                 There's always that.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe
                 it's a terrible tragedy.

                             JACK
                 ...no ...no ...

                             TYLER
                 I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,
                 neat little shit.  The trendy paper
                 lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,
                 am I right?

     Jack laughs, nods.  He shakes his head, drinks.

                             TYLER
                 But maybe, just maybe, you've been
                 delivered.

                             JACK
                       (toasts)
                 Delivered from Swedish furniture.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from armchairs in obscure
                 green stripe patterns.

                             JACK
                 Delivered from Martha Stewart.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from bullshit colors like
                 "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."

     They laugh together.  Then, silence.  They drink.

                             JACK
                 Insurance'll cover it.

                             TYLER
                 Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
                 list.

                             JACK
                 What list?

                             TYLER
                 The "now I get to go out and buy the
                 exact same stuff all over again"
                 list.  That list.

                             JACK
                 I don't... think so.

                             TYLER
                 This time maybe get a widescreen TV.
                 You'll be occupied for weeks.

                             JACK
                 Well, I have to file a claim...

                             TYLER
                 The things you own, they end up
                 owning you.

                             JACK
                 Don't I?

                             TYLER
                 Do what you like.

                             JACK
                       (looks at watch)
                 God, it's late.  I should find a
                 hotel...

                             TYLER
                 A hotel?

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

                             TYLER
                 So, you called me up, because you
                 just wanted to have a drink before
                 you... go find a hotel?

                             JACK
                 I don't follow...

                             TYLER
                 We're on our third pitcher of beer.
                 Just ask me.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                 You called me so you could have a
                 place to stay.

                             JACK
                 No, I...

                             TYLER
                 Why don't you cut the shit and ask if
                 you can stay at my place?

                             JACK
                 Would that be a problem?

                             TYLER
                 Is it a problem for you to ask?

                             JACK
                 Can I stay at your place?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, you can.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome.  But, I want you to
                 do me one favor.

                             JACK
                 What's that?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

     Freeze picture.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Let me tell you a little bit about
                 Tyler Durden.

     EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME

     -- And we see it's PORNOGRAPHY.

     INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

     Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,
     Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from
     movies.  Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.

                             JACK
                 Tyler was a night person.  He
                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.
                 A movie doesn't come in one big reel,
                 it's on a few.  In old theaters, two
                 projectors are used, so someone has
                 to change projectors at the exact
                 second when one reel ends and
                 another reel begins.  Sometimes you
                 can see two dots on screen in the
                 upper right hand corner...

     Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS
     briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.

                             TYLER
                 They're called "cigarette burns."

                             JACK
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

                             TYLER
                 Why would anyone want this shitty job?

                             JACK
                 It affords him other interesting
                 opportunities.

                             TYLER
                 -- Like splicing single frames from
                 adult movies into family films.

                             JACK
                 In reel three, right after the
                 courageous dog and the snooty cag --
                 who have celebrity voices -- eat out
                 of a garbage can, there's the flash
                 of Tyler's contribution...

     In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming,
     confused, looking at each other.

     A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling
     vaguely terrible.  Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans
     back in his seat.

     Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.

                             TYLER
                 One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's
                 how long it's up there.

                             JACK
                 No one really knows that they've seen it.
                 But they did.

                             TYLER
                 A nice, big cock.

                             JACK
                 Only a hummingbird could have caught
                 Tyler at work.

     INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

     Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP
     BOWLS.  Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.

                             JACK
                 Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter
                 at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

     The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a
     giant SOUP TUREEN.  His hands are at his open fly and he's
     in position to piss into the soup.

                             JACK
                 He was the guerrilla terrorist of the
                 food service industry.

                             TYLER
                 Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.

     Jack waits.  The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.

                             TYLER
                 ... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 He farted on meringue; he sneezed on
                 braised endive; and, with creme of
                 mushroom soup, well...

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Go ahead.  Say it.

                             JACK
                 You get the idea.

     EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING

     Tyler and Jack come out the back door.

                             JACK
                 I don't know about this.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, either.  I want to find
                 out.  I've never been hit, have you?

                             JACK
                 No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?

                             TYLER
                 I don't want to die without any
                 scars.  How much can you really know
                 about yourself if you've never been
                 in a fight?  Come on... you're the
                 only person I've ever asked.

                             JACK
                 Me?

     Jack stares at him.

                             TYLER
                 Why not you?  I'm letting you go
                 first.  Do it.

                             JACK
                 This is crazy.

                             TYLER
                 Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.

                             JACK
                 Where do you want it?  In the face?

                             TYLER
                 Surprise me.

     Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's
     neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.

                             JACK
                 Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.

                             TYLER
                 Like hell.  That counted.

     Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack
     falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up.

                             TYLER
                 How do you feel?

                             JACK
                 Strange.

                             TYLER
                 But a good strange.

                             JACK
                 Is it?

                             TYLER
                 We've crossed the threshold.  You
                 want to call it off?

                             JACK
                 Call what off?

                             TYLER
                 The fight.

                             JACK
                 What fight?

                             TYLER
                 This fight, pussy.

     Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under
     Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and
     Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier,
     drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.

     EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER

     Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights
     on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-
     induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away.

                             TYLER
                 If you could fight anyone... one on
                 one, whoever you wanted, who would
                 you fight?

                             JACK
                 Anyone?

                             TYLER
                 Anyone.

     Jack thinks.

                             JACK
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

                             TYLER
                 My dad.  No question.

     A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew
                 him, till I was six.  He went and
                 married another woman, had more kids.
                 Every six years or so he'd do it
                 again -- new city, new family.

                             TYLER
                 He was setting up franchises.  My
                 father never went to college, so it
                 was really important that I go.

                             JACK
                 I know that.

                             TYLER
                 After I graduated, I called him long
                 distance and asked, "Now what?"  He
                 said, "Get a job."  When I turned
                 twenty-five, I called him and asked,
                 "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know.
                 Get married."

                             JACK
                 Same here.

                             TYLER
                 A generation of men raised by women.
                 I'm wondering if another woman is the
                 answer we really need.

     Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.

                             JACK
                 We should do this again sometime.

     Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     A street sign: "PAPER STREET."  A PAPER MILL stis on one
     side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the
     land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story,
     long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.

                             JACK
                 Where's your car?

                             TYLER
                 What car?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I don't know how Tyler found the
                 house, but he'd been there for half
                 a year.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It looked like it was waiting to be
                 torn down.  Most of the windows were
                 boarded up.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

     Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 None of the doors locked.  The stairs
                 were ready to collapse.  I didn't
                 know if he owned it or he was
                 squatting.

     Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...

     INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Neither would have surprised me.

     INT. SHOWER - MORNING

     Jack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls.
     Water spits in starts.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing
                 leaked.  Turning on a light meant
                 another light in the house went out.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT.
     FIVE GUYS stand around watching.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee
     with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a
     flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork,
     starts roasting them over a burner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 There were no neighbors.  Just
                 warehouses and the paper mill.  The
                 fart smell of steam, the hamster cage
                 smell of wood chips.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT

     Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --
     THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 At night, Tyler and I were alone for
                 half a mile in every direction.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack
     and Tyler, who FIGHT.  THREE CARS are parked in the lot.

     INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep
     in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a
     certain order, showing Jack how it's done.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When it rained, we had to kill the
                 power.  By the end of the first
                 month, I didn't care about TV.  I
                 didn't mind the warm, stale
                 refrigerator.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     CANDLES BURN.  Tyler and Jack are seated across from each
     other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES.  Rain DRIPS
     from the ceiling.  No furniture.  THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The previous occupant had been a bit
                 of a shut-in.

                             TYLER
                       (of magazine)
                 Hum.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Oh, a new riot control grenade...
                       (reading)
                 "...the successful combination of
                 concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-
                 blasts and simultaneous high-velocity
                 disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."

     Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.

                             JACK
                       ("Reader's Digest")
                 "I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in
                 first person.  "Without me, Joe could
                 not take in oxygen to feed his red
                 blood cells."  There's a whole
                 series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

                             TYLER
                 "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

     Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,
     chooses another magazine.

                             JACK
                 What are you reading?

                             TYLER
                 Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week.
                 New Republic.

                             JACK
                 Show-off.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN
     GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING.  The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY
     than before.  In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I should have been haggling with my
                 insurance company.  I should have
                 been looking for a new condo...

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks along.  He stops, looking at a CHURCH with
     SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking
     coffee and sodas.  Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 .... I should have been upset about
                 my nice, neat, flaming little shit.

     Jack's face shows no reaction.  He continues to walk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But I wasn't.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his
     knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips.  Tyler,
     in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Most of the week, we were Ozzie and
                 Harriet.

     Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday
                 night...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  No one around, but there are at
     least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... we were finding something out: we
                 were finding out, more and more, that
                 we were not alone.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER.
     Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Thursday mornings, all I could do was
                 think about next week.

     Boss gives Jack a dubious look.  Walter's next SLIDE: a
     COMPUTER SCREEN.

                             WALTER
                 The basic premise of cyber-netting
                 your office is -- make things more
                 efficient.

                             BOSS
                 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

                             WALTER
                 Absolutely.

     Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Walter, the Microsoft account exec.
                 Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.
                 Maybe he was thinking about the free-
                 range potluck he'd been to last
                 weekend, or his church-group car-wash
                 fund-raiser.  Or, probably not.

     Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.

                             WALTER
                 I showed this already to my man here.
                 You liked it, didn't you?

     Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They GLOW
     eerily in the dim light.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You can swallow a pint of blood
                 before you get sick.

                             WALTER
                 Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened
                 to the other guy.

     Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Screw Walter.  His candy-ass wouldn't
                 last a second Wednesday night.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all
     directions.  CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed
     lot.  YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against
     the back wall, waiting.  The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:

                             IRVINE
                 Drink up people.  We're closing.

     Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS.  Drunken customers squint and
     get the message.  They plop down money, leaving.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was right in everyone's face.
                 Tyler and I just made it visible.

     Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members
     of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally,
     one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was on the tip of everyone's
                 tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a
                 name.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME

     A BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler
     standing directly beneath it.

                             TYLER
                 Welcome to fight club.

     The guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with
     eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.
     Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every week, Tyler gave the rules that
                 he and I decided.

     PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER
     DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.

                             TYLER
                 The first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.  The
                 second rule of fight club is -- you
                 don't talk about fight club.  The
                 third rule of fight club is -- when
                 someone says "stop" or goes limp, the
                 fight is over.  Fourth rule is --
                 only two guys to a fight.  Fifth
                 rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth
                 rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh
                 rule -- fights go on as long as they
                 have to.  And the eighth and final
                 rule -- if this is your first night
                 at fight club, you have to fight.

     Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN
     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --
                 couldn't remember whether you ordered
                 pens with blue ink or black ink ...

     The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
                 last week when he trounced an actuary
                 twice his size.

     Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies.
     SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of
     Goateed Man, POUNDING him...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes all you could hear were
                 flat, hard packing sounds over the
                 yelling, or the wet choke when
                 someone caught their breath and
                 sprayed...

                             GOATEED MAN
                       (spittle-lipped)
                 Ssssstop... !

     INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY

     Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a
     GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even if I could tell someone they had
                 a good fight, I wouldn't be talking
                 to the same man.

     The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda
     down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Who you were in fight club is not who
                 you were in the rest of the world.

     INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.
     He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an
     apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You weren't alive anywhere like you
                 were there.  But fight club only
                 exists in the hours between when
                 fight club starts and when fight club
                 ends.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from
     his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the
     doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated.

                             BOSS
                 What are you getting yourself into
                 every week?

     Jack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 After fight club, everything else in
                 your life gets the volume turned
                 down.  You can deal with anything.

                             BOSS
                 Have you finished those reports?

                             JACK
                       (handing him reports)
                 Yes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people who had power over you
                 have less and less.

     Jack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with
     his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 By this point, I could wiggle most of
                 the teeth in my jaw.

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A guy came to fight club for the
                 first time, his ass was a wad of
                 cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he
                 was carved out of wood.

                             JACK
                 If you could fight any celebrity?

                             TYLER
                 Alive or dead?

                             JACK
                 Doesn't matter.

                             TYLER
                 Hemingway.  You?

                             JACK
                 Shatner.  William Shatner.

     They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their
     cigarettes, getting on board...

     INT. BUS - DUSK

     The bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,
     Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We all started seeing things
                 differently.  Wherever we went.

     They hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a
     CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt sorry for all the guys packing
                 into gyms, trying to look like what
                 Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said
                 they should.

     Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.

                             TYLER
                 Self-improvement is masturbation.
                 Self-destruction is the answer.

     A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The
     Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the
     man, who stares back.

                             JACK
                       (to Tyler, so the
                        Man can hear)
                 You could take him.

     Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.
     Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.

                             TYLER
                 The trick is not to care.

     Tyler stares forward.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on
     top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The
     surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...

     Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips
     his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler
     turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...

                                                      CUT TO:

     Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --
     brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.
     Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

     Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching
     appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club wasn't about winning or
                 losing.  It wasn't about words.

     The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack
     snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like
     wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 They hysterical shouting was in
                 tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

     Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.
     The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.

                             JACK
                 ... stop...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When the fight was over, nothing was
                 solved, but nothing mattered.

     Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes
     through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their
     attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --
     similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.

                             TYLER
                 Cool.

     Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.

                             OPPONENT
                 How about next week?

                             JACK
                 Look at me.  How about next month?

     Everyone helps Jack walk.  He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Afterwards, we all felt saved.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.

                             TYLER
                 He fell down some stairs.

     The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.

                             JACK
                 I fell down some stairs.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

     Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR.  Tyler's clipping
     at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS.  Jack's
     brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club became the reason to cut
                 your hair short and trim your
                 fingernails.

                             TYLER
                 Any historical figure.

                             JACK
                 Okay... Ghandi.

                             TYLER
                 Good answer.

                             JACK
                 You?

                             TYLER
                 Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys
                 fight till they're burger.

     Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a
     TOOTH.  Jack looks at it.  Tyler puts scissors down, done.

                             TYLER
                 Remember, even the Mona Lisa's
                 falling apart.

     Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

     Jack enters, buttoning his shirt.  The PHONE RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME

     Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone
     cord around her neck.

                             MARLA
                 Where have you been the last few
                 weeks?

                             JACK
                 Marla?

     Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy
     flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone.

                             JACK
                       (quietly)
                 How did you find me?

                             MARLA
                 The forwarding number.  I haven't
                 seen you at any support groups.

                             JACK
                 That's the idea -- we split them.

                             MARLA
                 You haven't been going to yours.

                             JACK
                 I found a new one.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

                             JACK
                 It's for men.

                             MARLA
                 Like testicular cancer?

                             JACK
                 Look, this is a bad time...

                             MARLA
                 I've been going to debtor's
                 anonymous.  You want to see some
                 truly fucked up people?

                             JACK
                 I'm just on my way out...

                             MARLA
                 Me too.  I got a stomach full of
                 Xanax.  I took what was left of a
                 bottle.  Might've been too much.

     Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Picture yourself watching Marla
                 Singer throw herself around her
                 crummy apartment.

                             MARLA
                 This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
                 This is probably one of those cry-for-
                 help things.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This could go on for hours.

                             JACK
                 So you're staying in tonight?

                             MARLA
                 Do you want to wait to hear me
                 describe death?

     Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the
     hook, walks out the back door.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Do you want to listen and see if my
                 spirit can use the telephone?

     Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES,
     LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT.
     Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and
     LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE

     Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING

     Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been
                 living here two months, and Tyler's
                 door was never closed.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest.
     He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.

                             JACK
                 You're not going to believe what I
                 dreamt last night.

     Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's
     been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops.

                             MARLA
                 I can hardly believe anything about
                 last night.

     Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and
     SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing here?

                             MARLA
                 What... ?

                             JACK
                 What the hell are you doing here?

     Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.

                             MARLA
                 Fuck you.

     Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.
     Jack gets up, watches her stomp away.

     Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after
     Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack,
     then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering,
     slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler
     puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.

                             TYLER
                 She's a piece of work.  Get this --
                 I come in here last night, the
                 phone's off the hook...

     Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S
     VOICE FADES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I already knew the story before he
                 told it to me.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (from handset)
                 I'll tell you when I'm floating out
                 of my body.

     Tyler smiles.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler, off all people, think
                 it was a bad thing that Marla Singer
                 was about to die?

     INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars,
     looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the
     stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock,
     Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

     Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged
     eyes look him over.

                             MARLA
                 You got here fast.

     She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along
     with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

                             MARLA
                 The mattresses are all sealed in
                 slippery plastic.

     She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.

                             MARLA
                 Did I call you?

     Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO
     lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you.

     SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors
     opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.

                             MARLA
                 Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops...

     She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.

     INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

     Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE.
     COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits.
     Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.

                             COP
                 8-G!  Where's 8-G?

                             MARLA
                       (pointing)
                 End of the hall.

     The rescuers keep running.

                             MARLA
                       (calling after)
                 The girl who lives there used to be
                 a charming, lovely girl, but she's
                 lost faith in herself...

                             COP
                 Miss Singer, let us help you!  You
                 have every reason to live!

     Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.

                             MARLA
                 She's a monster!  Infectious human
                 waste!  Good luck trying to save her!

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler makes coffee.  Marla slouches against the refrigerator.

                             MARLA
                 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
                 You're gonna have to keep me up all
                 night.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler chuckles, shakes his head.

                             TYLER
                 Unbelievable, huh?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was obviously able to handle it.

     Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.

                             TYLER
                 I mean, this girl... uh, you're not
                 into her or anything... ?

                             JACK
                 No.  Not at all.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.

     Tyler lights his cigarette.

                             TYLER
                 You're sure?

                             JACK
                 Yeah, I'm sure.

                             TYLER
                 Good.  This chick was up on the table
                 with her legs in the stirrups before
                 the doctor even walked in the room.
                 The things that she said... I've
                 never heard a woman talk like that...

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear.

                             MARLA
                       (whispering)
                 I want to have your abortion.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's
     Digest just a little too tight.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler not go for that?
                 Night before last, he was splicing
                 sex organs into "Little Mermaid."

     Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.

                             TYLER
                 You're okay with this?

                             JACK
                 I'm fine.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Put a gun to my head and paint the
                 wall with my brains.

     Tyler smokes.

                             TYLER
                 She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay
                 away from that one.

                             JACK
                 Oh, and my pace is more librarians.

                             TYLER
                 Hey... don't knock librarians.

                             JACK
                 Marla doesn't need a lover.  She
                 needs a case worker.

                             TYLER
                 She needs an exorcist.  This isn't
                 love.  This is sport-fucking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She'd invaded my support groups, now
                 she's invading my home.

                             TYLER
                 Listen... do me a favor... sit here
                 a minute...

     Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts
     down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 You've gotta understand something
                 about me.  I have a little rule,
                 okay?  Don't ever talk to her about
                 me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind
                 of shit.

     Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

                             TYLER
                 If you ever say anything about me or
                 about what happens here in this
                 house, to her or anyone -- I will
                 find out.  And you'll never see me
                 again.  Promise me.

                             JACK
                 Okay.

                             TYLER
                 Promise you won't.

                             JACK
                 Yes, I promise.

                             TYLER
                 Promise?

                             JACK
                 I said I promise!

                             TYLER
                 That was three times you promised.

     Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If only I had wasted a couple of
                 minutes and gone to watch Marla die,
                 none of this would have happened.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds
     of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (muffled through wall)
                 Miserable fucking discharge!

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I could've moved to another room, one
                 on the third floor -- so I wouldn't
                 have heard them.  But I didn't.

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

     Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the
     landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in...

     Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN
     WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

     Jack steps back.

                             JACK
                 I... uh... just going to bed.

     Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.

                             TYLER
                 You want to finish her off?

                             JACK
                 Uh... nah...

     Jack continues toward his room.

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became the calm, little center of
                 the world.  I was the Zen master.

     CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR

     Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.

                              "Worker bees can leave
                               Even drones can fly away
                               The queen is their slave"

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wrote little haiku poems.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits
     in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I faxed them around to everyone.

     He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND.  He presses
     this key over and over.  Boss enters.

                             BOSS
                 Is that your blood?

                             JACK
                 Some of it, yes.

     Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.

                             BOSS
                 Take the rest of the day off.  Come
                 back tomorrow with clean clothes.
                 Get yourself together.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS
     who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I got right in everyone's hostile
                 little face.  Yes, these are bruises
                 from fighting.  I'm comfortable with
                 them.  I am enlightened.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

     Jack walks toward the HOUSE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You give up the condo life, give up
                 all your flaming worldly possessions,
                 go live in a dilapidated house in the
                 toxic waste part of town...

     INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET

     Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA
     from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and you come home to this.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                       (laughing)
                 You fucking slut!!

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Thank you, sir, may I have another!
                 Thank you sir, may I have another... !

     Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in
     the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood
     stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.  Speaking.

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE

     A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 This is Detective Stern with the
                 arson unit.  We have some new
                 information about the "incident" at
                 your condo.

                             JACK
                 Yes?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I don't know if you're aware... your
                 front door -- it seems someone
                 sprayed freon into the lock, then
                 tapped it with a chisel to shatter
                 the cylinder.

                             JACK
                 No, I wasn't aware...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Does this sound strange to you?

                             JACK
                 Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.

     Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 The dynamite...

                             JACK
                 Dynamite?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium
                 oxalate and potassium perchloride.
                 Do you know what that means?

                             JACK
                 What does that mean?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 It means it was homemade.

                             JACK
                 This is... really a shock...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Whoever set this homemade dynamite
                 could've blown out the pilot light
                 days before the explosion.  The gas,
                 it seems, was just a detonator.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think could've done this?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I'll ask the questions, son.

                             TYLER
                       (whispering in Jack's ear)
                 Tell him...

     Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler
     standing right next to him.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                       (overlap w/below)
                 "The liberator who destroyed my
                 property has re-aligned my paradigm
                 of perception."

                             JACK
                 Shhhhhh!
                       (into phone,
                        overlap w/above)
                 I don't know what to make of this,
                 sir, I really don't...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Do you know anyone who'd have the
                 expertise or motive to do something
                 like this?

                             TYLER
                 "I reject the basic assumptions of
                 civilization, including material
                 possession."

     Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo.
                 I loved every stick of furniture.
                 The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were
                 me.  The dishes were me.  The plants
                 were...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd like to thank the academy...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Well, if any ideas come to you, give
                 me a call.  In the meantime, don't
                 leave town.  I may need to bring you
                 in for questioning.

     END INTERCUT

     Jack hangs up.  Tyler shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  You could be cursed
                 with the three terrible Karmas.  You
                 could be beautiful, rich and famous.

     Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's
     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...

     Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing
     water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla
     lights a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Except for their humping, Tyler and
                 Marla were never in the same room.

                             MARLA
                 I got this dress at a thrift store
                 for one dollar.

                             JACK
                       (keeps scrubbing)
                 Worth every penny.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 My parents pulled this exact act for
                 years -- one came in, the other
                 disappeared.

     Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to
     Jack.  She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close
     to Jack's body, almost touhcing.

                             MARLA
                       (seductive)
                 It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone
                 loved it intensely for one day, then
                 tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --
                 so special, then, bam -- it's
                 abandoned on the side of the road,
                 tinsel still clinging to it...

     Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses
     against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up.

                             MARLA
                 Like sex crime victims, underwear
                 inside-out, bound with electrical
                 tape.

                             JACK
                       (coldly)
                 It suits you.

     She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:

                             MARLA
                 You can borrow it sometime.

     Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke
     in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the
     sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Get rid of her.

     Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.

                             JACK
                 You get rid of her.

                             TYLER
                       (pointing at Jack)
                 Don't mention me.

     Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the
     archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes
     and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something
     on the junk strewn table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm six years old again, passing
                 messages between my parents.

                             JACK
                 I, uh... think you should go now.

     Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,
     pushing other things off to the floor.

                             JACK
                 It's time for you to leave.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry, I'm leaving.

     Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She
     moves up into Jack's face.

                             MARLA
                 You're such a nutcase, I can't even
                 begin to keep up.

                             JACK
                 Goodbye.

     She laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door,
     she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls."
     Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Nice work.

     Jack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window,
     Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant
     of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 To make soap, first we have to render
                 fat.

     Jack looks at Tyler.

     CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."

     EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT

     Tyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence,
     struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over,
     snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps.

     FOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a
     DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD
     moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away.

     MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler
     eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.

                             TYLER
                 The best fat for making soap --
                 because the salt balance is just
                 right -- comes form human bodies...

     Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.

                             JACK
                 What is this place?

                             TYLER
                 A liposuction clinic.

     From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,
     thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.

                             TYLER
                 Paydirt.  From society's richest
                 asses and thighs.

     TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying
     BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down
     the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs.
     Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.

                             TYLER
                 As the fat renders, the tallow floats
                 to the surface.  Remember the crap
                 they taught you in Boy Scouts.

                             JACK
                 Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.

                             TYLER
                 This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll
                 mix it back in when we make the soap.

     Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the
     glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it.

                             TYLER
                 Lye -- the crucial ingredient.
                       (adding lye to mix)
                 Ancient peoples found their clothes
                 got cleaner if they washed them at a
                 certain spot in the river.  Why?
                 Because, human sacrifices were once
                 made on the hills above this river.
                 Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain
                 feel.  Water seeped through the wood
                 ashes to become lye.  The lye
                 combined with the melted fat of the
                 bodies, till a thick white soapy
                 discharge crept into the river.

     Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes
     Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.

                             TYLER
                 The first soap was made from the
                 ashes of heroes.  Like the first
                 monkeys shot into space.

     The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a
     bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.

                             TYLER
                 Without sacrifice, without death, we
                 would have nothing.

     Jack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand
     and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.

                             TYLER
                 This is a chemical burn.  It will
                 hurt more than you've ever been
                 burned and you will have a scar.

     Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of
     Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the
                 back of my hand.

                             TYLER
                 Look at your hand.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Guided meditation worked for cancer,
                 it could work for this.

     Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.

                             TYLER
                 Come back to the pain.  Don't shut
                 this out.

     Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler
     keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I tried not to think of the words
                 "searing" or "flesh."  I imagined my
                 pain as a ball of healing white light.

     SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...

                             TYLER
                 Stop it.  This is your pain -- your
                 burning hand.  It's right here.  Look
                 at it.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I was going to my cave to find my
                 power animal.

     SHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand again.  Jack re-focuses on Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 Don't deal with this the way those
                 dead people do.  Deal with it the way
                 a living person does.

     SHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A
     FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US.  RESUME:

     Jack tries to pull his hand free.  Tyler won't let go.
     Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain:

                             JACK
                 I... I think I understand.  I think
                 I get it...

                             TYLER
                 No, what you're feeling is premature
                 enlightenment.

     SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...

                             TYLER
                 This is the greatest moment of your
                 life and you're off somewhere,
                 missing it.

                             JACK
                 No, I'm not...

     SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

                             TYLER
                 Shut up.  Our fathers were our models
                 for God.  And, if our fathers bailed,
                 what does that tell us about God?

                             JACK
                 I don't know...

     SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face again...

                             TYLER
                 Listen to me.  You have to consider
                 the possibility that God doesn't like
                 you, he never wanted you.  In all
                 probability, He hates you.  This is
                 not the worst thing that can happen...

                             JACK
                 It isn't... ?

                             TYLER
                 We don't need him...

                             JACK
                 We don't... ?

     SHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP
     OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER
     MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME:

     Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...

                             JACK
                 ... Marla ... ?

                             TYLER
                 Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We
                 are God's unwanted children, with no
                 special place and no special
                 attention, and so be it.

     Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best
     to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled
     knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.

                             TYLER
                 You can go to the sink and run water
                 over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you
                 can use vinegar to neutralize the
                 burn, but first you have to give up.
                 First, you have to know that someday,
                 you are going to die.  Until you know
                 that, you will be useless.

     Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...

                             JACK
                 You ... you don't know what this
                 feels like, Tyler.

     Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.
     Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle
     of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.

     Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

                             TYLER
                 Congratulations.  You're a step
                 closer to hitting bottom.

     INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-
     over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms.

     There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on
     the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get
     arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler sold the soap to department
                 stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God
                 knows what they charged.  How ironic.
                 We were selling rich women their own
                 fat asses back to them.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,
     smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must
                 be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie
                 to work anymore.

     Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 "The first rule of fight club is you
                 don't talk about fight club."

     Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I must've left the original in the
                 copy machine.

                             BOSS
                 "The second rule of fight club...
                 Is this yours?

                             JACK
                 Hmm?

                             BOSS
                 You don't get paid to abuse the copy
                 machine.

                             JACK
                 "Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an
                 image.

                             BOSS
                 Pretend you're me.  You find this.
                 What would you do?

     Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.

                             JACK
                 Me? I'd be very careful who I talked
                 to about this.  It sounds like
                 someone dangerous wrote it... someone
                 who might snap at any moment,
                 stalking from office to office with
                 an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas
                 semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round
                 after round into colleagues and co-
                 workers.

     Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts
     tearing it into pieces.

                             JACK
                 Might be someone you've known for
                 years... somebody very close to you.
                 Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing
                 me every little piece of trash you
                 pick up.

     Jack puts the PAPER in his trash.  Bass stares with a tinge
     of outrage, a tinge of fear.  PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it.

                             JACK
                 Compliance and Liability.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 My tit's going to rot off.

                             JACK
                 Just a second.
                       (to Boss; smiles)
                 Could you excuse me?  I need to take
                 this call.

     Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 What are you talking about?

     INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...

                             MARLA
                 Would you do something for me?  I
                 need you to check and see if there's
                 a lump in my breast.  I can't afford
                 to throw money away on a doctor.

                             JACK
                 I don't know ...

                             MARLA
                 Please.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral
                 in her book.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES
     from a VAN with the sign "MEALS ON WHEELS."

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla leads Jack inside.

                             JACK
                 This is a sweet side of you.  Picking
                 these up for ...
                       (reads the boxes:)
                 "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines."
                 Where are they?

                             MARLA
                 Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive
                 and I'm in poverty.  You want any?

                             JACK
                 No, thanks.

                             MARLA
                 Good.

     He stares at her while she eats.

                             MARLA
                 What happened to your hand?

     Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open.  Jack
     stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her
     breast.  Marla's hand guides his.

                             JACK
                 Where?  Here?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 There?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 Here.

                             MARLA
                 Feel anything?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Jack's head is behind Marla's.  They speak softer, slower.

                             MARLA
                 Make sure.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

                             MARLA
                 You feel nothing?

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.

                             MARLA
                 Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.

                             JACK
                 No... no problem.

                             MARLA
                 I wish I could return the favor.

     Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.

                             JACK
                 I think everything's okay here.

                             MARLA
                 I could check your prostate.

                             JACK
                 Uh ... nah.

                             MARLA
                       (pause)
                 Well... thanks, anyway.

     Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than
     just friendly.  Jack pulls away.

                             JACK
                 So.... are we done?

     Marla sighs.

                             MARLA
                 Yeah, we're done.  See you around.

     EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window,
     watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big
     BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.

                             BOB
                 Cornelius!  How are you?

                             JACK
                 Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?

                             BOB
                 Better than I've ever been in my life.

                             JACK
                 Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men
                 Together?"

     An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.

                             BOB
                 No.  I found something new.

                             JACK
                 Really, what's that?

                             BOB
                       (quietly)
                 The first rule is... you aren't
                 supposed to talk about it...

                             JACK
                 Oh.

                             BOB
                 And the second rule about it is...
                 you're not supposed to talk about it.
                 And the third rule...

                             JACK
                 Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

                                  BOB
                 You are?!

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.

     Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.

                             BOB
                 That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking
                 great! Congratulations.

                             JACK
                 Yeah, both of us.

                             BOB
                 You know about the guy who invented
                 it? I hear all kinds of things.
                 Supposedly, he was born in a mental
                 institution.  They say he only sleeps
                 one hour a night.  You know about
                 this guy?  Tyler Durden?

     INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the
     circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee.

     EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER

     Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none
     of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob
     Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin
     with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack.

                             BOB
                 Thank you.  Thank you.

     Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a
     sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.

                             JACK
                 You're welcome.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club -- this was mine and
                 Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.

     INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK.
     Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack
     takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack...

                             TYLER
                 No thanks, I quit.

                             JACK
                 You quit?

                             TYLER
                 Yeah.  Where you headed?

                             JACK
                 Work.  Going to work.

     Tyler scratches his chin absently.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Nothing.  Do what you like.

     Tyler walks out the way he came.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER.

     INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe.
     Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             BOSS
                 Okay.  Where to begin?  With your
                 constant absenteeism?  With your
                 unpresentable appearance?  You're up
                 for review...

                             JACK
                 I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.

     Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

                             JACK
                 Let's pretend.  You're the Department
                 of Transportation, and you discover
                 that our company intentionally did
                 nothing about leather seats cured in
                 third world countries with chemicals
                 we know cause birth defects?  Brake
                 linings that fail after a thousand
                 miles.  Fuel injectors that burn
                 people alive.

                             BOSS
                 Just who the fuck do you think you
                 are?!  Get out!  You're fired!

                             JACK
                 What about this?  Keep me on payroll
                 as an outside consultant.  In
                 exchange for my salary, I'll keep my
                 mouth shut.  I won't need to come to
                 the office.  I can do this job from
                 home.

     Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

                             BOSS
                 You little fucker!  I oughta...

     Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle.
     He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by
     the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and
     SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.

     Jack gets back to his feet.

                             JACK
                 Please... don't hit me again, please.
                 I'm your responsibility...

     He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.
     He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents
     flying.  He hits the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For some reason, I thought of my
                 first fight -- with Tyler.

     Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.

                             JACK
                 Please... give me the paychecks like
                 I asked for.  I won't be any trouble.
                 You won't see me again.

     Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off.
     Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything this man took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting
     himself up.  He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, SMUDGES
     blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.

                             JACK
                 Please... please...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And right then, at our most excellent
                 moment together...

     Two SECURITY GUARDS enter and gape at the sight.  Behind
     them stand CURIOUS WORKERS, looking in.

                             JACK
                       (gurgling blood)
                 Please don't hit me again.

     INT. TYLER'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - DAY

     Jack holds a CHECK in front of Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Six months advance pay.  Six months!

                             TYLER
                 Fucking sweet.

                             JACK
                 Okay, and... and...

     Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.

                             JACK
                 Forty-eight airline flight coupons.
                 Plus... hold on... just a minute...

     Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door.  He
     drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with
     his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.

                             JACK
                 I am now officially self-employed.

     Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.

                             TYLER
                 Good for you.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     LOUD.  An enormous CROWD of guys, including Jack and Bob,
     stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle,
     holding up his hands to quiet them...

                             TYLER
                 I look around... I look around and
                 see a lot of new faces.

     An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 Shut up!  Which means a lot of you
                 have been breaking the first two
                 rules of fight club.

     A glum silence falls.  Guys look at each other.

                             TYLER
                 I see in fight club the strongest and
                 smartest men who have ever lived --
                 an entire generation pumping gas and
                 waiting tables; or they're slaves
                 with white collars.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 Advertisements have them chasing cars
                 and clothes, working jobs they hate
                 so they can buy shit they don't need.
                 We are the middle children of
                 history, with no purpose or place.
                 We have no great war, or great
                 depression.  The great war is a
                 spiritual war.  The great depression
                 is our lives.  We were raised by
                 television to believe that we'd be
                 millionaires and movie gods and rock
                 stars -- but we won't.  And we're
                 learning that fact.  And we're very,
                 very pissed-off.

     The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement.  Jack
     looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 We are the quiet young men who listen
                 until it's time to decide.

     A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into
     the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.

                             TYLER
                 Who are you?

                             FAT MAN (LOU)
                 Who am I?!  There's a sign on the
                 front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm
                 fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.

                             LOU
                 Who told you motherfuckers you could
                 use my place?

                             TYLER
                 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

                             LOU
                 Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a
                 broken collarbone.

     Everyone glances guiltily at each other.

                             LOU
                 He don't own this place, I do.  How
                 much money's he getting for this?

                             TYLER
                 There is no money.

                             LOU
                 Really?

                             TYLER
                 It's free to all.

                             LOU
                 Ain't that something?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, it is.

                             LOU
                 Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone
                 outta here now!

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome to join our club.

                             LOU
                 Did you hear what I just said?!

                             TYLER
                 You and your friend.

     Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             LOU
                 You hear me now?

     Tyler gains his breath, determined.  He looks up, turns his
     head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.

     Tyler straightens, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

     Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move
     forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward
     anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.

     More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 We really need to use this place.

     Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his
     face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou
     starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.

                             TYLER
                 That's it.... that's good.  Get it
                 all out.  You'll feel better.

     Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,
     sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who
     is just as bewildered.

     Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...

                             TYLER
                 Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
                 this whole fucking world...

     Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler
     off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler
     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou
     slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler
     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...

                             TYLER
                 You don't know where I've been.

     Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his
     bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler
     clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...

                             TYLER
                 We need this place.  We need it.
                 Please let us keep it, please...

     Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.

                             LOU
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 Pleeeeeease!

                             LOU
                 Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the
                 basement!  Get off me!

                             TYLER
                 We need some towels, Lou.  We need
                 replacement light bulbs.

                             LOU
                 Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!

                             TYLER
                 Thank you.  Thank you, sir...

                             LOU
                 Let go of me!!

     Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug
     drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to
     his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He
     and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.

     Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to
     a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his
     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs
     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.

                             TYLER
                 This week, each of you has a homework
                 assignment.  You're going to go out
                 and start a fight with a total
                 stranger...
                       (pause, drooling blood)
                 You're going to start a fight... and
                 you're going to lose.

     Jack beams in appreciation.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll
                 do just about anything to avoid a
                 fight.

     The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him...

                             YUPPIE
                 Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what
                 are you doing?!  Who are you?!!

     The Yuppie backs away.  Ricky follows...

                             YUPPIE
                 Get away from me!  Keep away!
                 NO... !

     Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie.  The Yuppie struggles spastically.

                             YUPPIE
                 Who are you!?  Why are you attacking
                 me... ?!

     Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.

     EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

     A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the
     sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.

                             FIRST MAN
                 Hey... hey...

                             SECOND MAN
                 Watch out, jackass!

     These men continue on their way.

     The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who
     looks down, stunned.

                             SEMINARIAN
                 You... you did that on purpose!

     The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs
     the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic
     shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.
     The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to
     run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the
     Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight.

     INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

     A FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a
     neck and squeezes, blood and sweat dripping.  It's the
     YUPPIE and the SEMINARIAN fighting.  Tyler walks around the
     perimeter of the circle.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Now nobody was the center of fight
                 club except the two men fighting.
                 The leader walked around in the
                 crowd, out in the darkness.

     Tyler hands ENVELOPES out to the crowd.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everyone took a homework assignment.

     EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

     Ricky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which
     reads: "DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO
     FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY."

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS use a MARKER, writing on a FILE: "Disinformation."

     EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work
     together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from
     the ground.  They reverse it, then replace it.

     MOMENTS LATER

     Jack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD.

                             JACK
                 There's fight club in Delaware City.

                             TYLER
                 I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

     As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against
     front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...

                             JACK
                 Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.
                 And, Bob said he was at fight club in
                 Newcastle last week.

                             TYLER
                 Newcastle?  Did you start that one?

                             JACK
                 I thought you did.

     In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot --
     front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.

     INT. FAMILY HOUSEHOLD -- NIGHT

     FATHER, MOTHER, YOUNG DAUGHTER and SON, eat dinner, watching
     TELEVISION.  Suddenly, the TV IMAGE turns to SNOW and static.

     Family members stop eating.  Father picks up the REMOTE,
     points it -- all channels are SNOW.

     Father turns the TV OFF.  He and his family members look at
     each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable.

     EXT. CITY ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

     The Yuppie SWINGS a BASEBALL BAT -- DESTROYS a digital
     SATELLITE DISH.  The Yuppie and the Seminarian move on,
     climbing to a neighboring rooftop.  They come upon another
     DISH.  The Seminarian takes the bat, takes a SWING...

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS place NEWS CLIPPINGS into a FILE: "Mischief."

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - ON GROUND - DAY

     Two AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE,MEN, with bruised faces, rip open
     a box from a PRINT SHOP.  They dig up AIRPLANE SAFETY
     INSTRUCTION CARDS and begin inserting them into each
     seatback.  We SEE a CARD - it shows passengers SCREAMING
     and FLAILING ABOUT IN TERROR.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     Huge office.  Rows and rows of desks.  FIGHT CLUB MEMBERS
     work: one guy moving from COMPUTER MONITOR to COMPUTER
     MONITOR, using a DRILL to drill a hole into the top of each.

     Other guys follow behind, with FUNNELS and CANS of GASOLINE,
     filling each monitor with gasoline.

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     Files and newspaper clippings are piled up.  HANDS write on
     a new FILE FOLDER: "Arson."

     EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

     The Yuppie crumbles a loaf of stale bread into a bucket,
     stirring it with a big spoon, mixing in a BOTTLE of EX-LAX.

     Nearby, Rob throws handfuls of wet BREADCRUMBS to PIGEONS...
     HUNDREDS of PIGEONS -- a rooftop feeding-frenzy.

     EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack cross the parking lot, towards the
     convenience store.  Jack wears a BACKPACK.

                             TYLER
                 Let me have that a minute...

     Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.

                             JACK
                 What are we doing?

                             TYLER
                 Homework assignment.

                             JACK
                 What is it?

     Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.

                             TYLER
                 Human Sacrifice.

     Jack turns white, staring at the gun.

     EXT. BEHIND THE CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

     The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out
     at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.  Jack follows,
     freaked.  Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

                             CLERK
                 Please... don't...

                             TYLER
                 Give me your wallet.

     The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler
     snatches it.  Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.

                             TYLER
                 Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,
                 apartment A.  A small, cramped
                 basement apartment.

                             RAYMOND
                 How'd you know?

                             TYLER
                 They give basement apartments letters
                 instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're
                 going to die.

     Tyler rummages through the wallet.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

                             RAYMOND
                 Yesssss...

                             TYLER
                 Your mom and dad will have to call
                 kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up
                 your dental records, because there
                 won't be much left of your face.

                             RAYMOND
                 Please, God, no...

     Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 An expired community college student
                 ID card.  What did you used to study,
                 Raymond K. Hessel?

                             RAYMOND
                 S-S-Stuff.

                             TYLER
                 "Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?

     Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.

                             TYLER
                 I asked you what you studied.

                             JACK
                 Tell him!

                             RAYMOND
                 Biology, mostly.

                             TYLER
                 Why?

                             RAYMOND
                 I... I don't know...

                             TYLER
                 What did you want to be, Raymond K.
                 Hessel?

     Raymond weeps and says nothing.  Tyler COCKS the gun.
     Raymond GASPS.

                             TYLER
                 The question, Raymond, was "what did
                 you want to be?"

     A beat.

                             JACK
                 Answer him!

                             RAYMOND
                 A veterinarian!

                             TYLER
                 Animals.

                             RAYMOND
                 Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

                             TYLER
                 Stuff.  That means you have to get
                 more schooling.

                             RAYMOND
                 Too much school.

     Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.

                             TYLER
                 Would you rather be dead?

                             RAYMOND
                 No, please, no, God, no!

     Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.

                             RAYMOND
                 NOOOOO!

     Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.

                             TYLER
                 I'm keeping your license.  I know
                 where you live.  I'm going to check
                 on you.  If you aren't back in school
                 and on your way to being a
                 veterinarian in six weeks, you will
                 be dead.  Get the hell out of here.

     Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack
     and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.

                             JACK
                   I feel sick.

                             TYLER
                   Imagine how he feels.

     Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --
     CLICK.  Empty.

                             JACK
                 I don't care, that was horrible.

     Tyler walks away.

                             TYLER
                 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful
                 day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.

     Jack watches Tyler go.

                             TYLER
                 His breakfast will taste better than
                 any meal he has ever eaten.

     Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.  He finally
     turns back, following after Tyler.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled
     COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... !

     EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING

     Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN

     VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it
     across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his
     shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work...

                             TYLER
                       (muttering quietly)
                 ... You are not how much money you
                 have in the bank.  You are not the
                 shoes you wear.

     Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of
     the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...

                             TYLER
                 You are not the contents of your
                 wallet...

     INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

     The DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for
     Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't
                 see it till it hit you between the
                 eyes.
                       (pause)
                 But, it started to make sense... in
                 a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No
                 distractions.  The ability to let
                 that which does not matter truly
                 slide.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     Jack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it
     dropped Jack off right in front of the house.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with
     PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator.

                             JACK
                 Hey.

                             TYLER
                 Hey.

     Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler
     comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.

                             TYLER
                 Go on in.  We're celebrating.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT
     follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in
     front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed
     in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.

                             RICKY
                 You are not your job.

                             OTHERS TOGETHER
                 You are not your job.

                             RICKY
                 You are not how much money you have
                 in the bank.

                             BOB
                 Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...

     Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with
     an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.

                             ANGEL FACE
                       (to Jack)
                 Great, thanks.

     Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.

                             BOB
                 Shhhhh!  Watch!

     Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER
     MORRIS BUILDING."  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE
     PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames
     pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.

                             REPORTER (V.O.)
                 Police Commissioner Jacobs has just
                 arrived... just a second... excuse
                 me, Commissioner, could you tell us
                 what you think has happened?

     COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.

                             COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)
                 We believe this is related to the
                 recent acts of vandalism around the
                 city.  It's some kind of organized
                 group, and we are coordinating a
                 rigorous investigation.

     Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler
     tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.

                             JACK
                 What did you guys do?

     They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake
     their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys'
     faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid.

                             BOB
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem
                 is... you do not ask questions.

     Jack stares at them.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.
     He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S
     UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...
     RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Jacobs saunters down an empty hall.  He stops to check his
     tie in a mirror.  He pushes open the door of the MEN'S
     BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the
     bathroom.  He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth.  The
     OTHER "WAITERS" rush in.  Jack stays back to keep the door
     shut.  Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his
     pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.

                             TYLER
                 Wrap it around the top of his hackie-
                 sack.

                             BOB
                 Man, his balls are ice cold.

     Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.
     Jacobs is bug-eyed.  Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.

                             TYLER
                 You're not going to continue your
                 "rigorous investigation."  You will
                 publicly state that there is no
                 underground group.  Or -- imagine,
                 the rest of your life with your
                 scrotum flapping empty.

                             JACOBS
                       (mouth taped)
                 ... no... please, no...

                             TYLER
                 We'll send one to the New York Times
                 and one to the Los Angeles Times.
                 Press release style.  Your nuts will
                 be bicoastal.  Understood?  The
                 people you're after are everyone you
                 depend on.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 We do your laundry, cook your food
                 and serve you dinner.  We guard you
                 while you sleep.  We drive your
                 ambulances.  Do not fuck with us.

     Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to
     JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.

     EXT. HOTEL - LATER

     Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE
     ENTRANCE.  Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.
     Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.

     Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Fight club in full swing.  Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING
     the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt like putting a bullet between
                 the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't
                 screw to save its species.

     The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an
     inscrutable stone face.

     Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard.  Blood
     flies.  The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wanted to open the dump valves on
                 oil tankers and smother all the
                 French beaches I'd never see.

     Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious.  Jack stops,
     stares down, numb.  Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to
     let him pass.  Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

                             JACK
                 I felt like destroying something
                 beautiful.

     EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER

     RAINING.  Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.
     A idling car HONKS.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.  A bruised-
     faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.

                             VALET
                 There you are, Mr. Durden.  Airport
                 parking, long term.

                             JACK
                       (motions to car)
                 After you, Mr. Durden...

                             TYLER
                 No... after you.

     INT. STOLEN CAR

     Tyler gets in the driver's seat.  Jack gets into the front
     passenger seat.  Ricky and the mechanic are in back.

     EXT. STREET

     Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb.  It has two
     bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."

     INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER

     RAIN GUSHES down.  Jack stews, silent.  The car moves down
     a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.

                             TYLER
                 Something on your mind?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I told about "Project
                 Mayhem?"

                             TYLER
                 What should I have told you?

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I involved from the
                 beginning?  You and I started fight
                 club together.

                             TYLER
                 Fight club was the beginning.  Now
                 it's out of the basements and there's a
                 name for it -- Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem is
                 you do not ask questions.

                             JACK
                 This is as much mine as yours.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it
                 about you and me?

                             JACK
                 You know what I mean.

                             TYLER
                 What do you want?  A statement of
                 purpose... ?

                             JACK
                 Look...

                             TYLER
                 Should I E-mail you?  Should I put
                 this on your "action item list?"

                             JACK
                 I want to know --

                             TYLER
                 What do you want to know about
                 Project Mayhem?

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem --

                             JACK
                       (to Ricky and Mechanic)
                 Shut up!!
                       (to Tyler)
                 I want to know what's going on.

     Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...
     Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...

                             TYLER
                 This does not belong to us.  We are
                 not the leaders.  We are not special.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world.  We are all part
                 of the same compost heap...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     Tyler steers back into the proper lane.  The other CAR flies
     past, HORN SOUNDING...

                             JACK
                 What the hell ... ?!

                             TYLER
                 You choose your level of involvement.
                 I won't make decisions for you.

                             JACK
                 I'm not asking you to.

                             TYLER
                 You're asking questions that don't
                 have answers.  You know just as much
                 about Project Mayhem as anybody else.

                             JACK
                 I don't think that's true.

     Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.
     Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.

                             JACK
                 Tyler... what is this... !

     Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.

                             TYLER
                 What will you wish you'd done before
                 you died?

                             RICKY
                 Paint a self-portrait.

                             MECHANIC
                 Build a house.

                             TYLER
                       (to Jack)
                 And you?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Nothing!

                             TYLER
                 If you died right now, how would you
                 feel about your life?

                             JACK
                 I would feel nothing about my life?
                 Is that what you want to hear?!

     The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves
     to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.

                             TYLER
                 I want to hear the truth.

                             JACK
                 Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck
                 you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of
                 this.  How's that?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you think I blew up your condo?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend
                 retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You
                 have to forget everything you know,
                 everything you think you know --
                 about life, about friendship, about
                 you and me.

     Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his
     hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the
     wheel... the car swerves...

     The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.

     Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at
     Tyler with dead eyes.

                             JACK
                 Okay, okay... fine...

     Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.
     Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to
     take the wheel.

     THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of
     the road, surrounded by flares.

     Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the
     shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are
     illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles.

     They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The
     back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-
     over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd never been in a car accident.
                 This must've been what all those
                 statistics felt like before I filed
                 them into my reports.

     The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.

     EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

     Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around...
     opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the
     mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear
     window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.

                             TYLER
                 We just had a near-life experience.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the
     ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair.

                             TYLER
                 In the world I see -- you're stalking
                 elk through the damp canyon forests
                 around the ruins of Rockefeller
                 Center.  You will wear leather
                 clothes that last you the rest of
                 your life.  You will climb the wrist-
                 thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears
                 Tower.  You will see tiny figures
                 pounding corn and laying-strips of
                 venison on the empty car pool lane of
                 the ruins of a superhighway.

     Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.

                             TYLER
                       (leaving)
                 Feel better, champ.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed,
     seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and
     HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.

     Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the
     counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours
     ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:

                             MARLA
                 I'll be out of your way in a sec.

     She seems to be as weak as Jack.

                             JACK
                 You... don't have to... leave.

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.

                             JACK
                 Really... I mean it.
                       (pause)
                 Have you been going to your groups?

                             MARLA
                 Chloe's dead.

                             JACK
                 When?

                             MARLA
                 Do you care?

                             JACK
                 I don't know.

                             MARLA
                 It was the smart move on her part.

     Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.
     There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer.

                             JACK
                 Why are we both... caught up like
                 this... with... ?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I came so close to saying Tyler's
                 name, I could feel it vibrate inside
                 my mouth.

     Marla looks a him, waiting.

                             JACK
                 I don't understand.  Why does a weak
                 person have to go out and find a
                 strong person... to hang onto?

                             MARLA
                 What do you get out of it?

     Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite
     figure where it's coming from.

                             JACK
                 You hear that?

                             MARLA
                 Hear what?

                             JACK
                 That... sawing and hammering.

                             MARLA
                 Have we been talking too long?  Must
                 we change the subject?

     Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,
     Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.

                             TYLER
                       (harsh whisper)
                 You're not talking about me, are you?

     Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 No.

                             MARLA
                 That day you came over to my place to
                 play doctor... what was going on
                 there?

                             TYLER
                       (still a whisper)
                 What are you talking about?

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 Nothing.

                             MARLA
                 Nothing?  I don't think so.

                             TYLER
                       (whisper)
                 This conversation...

                             JACK
                 This conversation...

                             TYLER
                 ... is over.

                             JACK
                 ... is over.

     Marla comes to touch Jack's hair.  Jack closes the basement
     door.  Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his
     hand.  Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.

                             MARLA
                 What is this?  Who did this?

                             JACK
                 ... A person.

                             MARLA
                 Guy or girl?

                             JACK
                 Why would you ask if it's a guy or a
                 girl?!

                             MARLA
                 Why would you get bent if I asked?

                             JACK
                 Let go of me...
                       (pulls his hand free)
                 Leave me alone.

                             MARLA
                 You're afraid to say.

     Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with
     frustration.  She leaves out the back door, not looking back.

     Jack leans against the wall.  After a moment, he opens the
     basement door, heads downstairs...

     INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE

     Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...

     INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks around.  TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the
     basement, as many as can fit into the space.

                             JACK
                       (calling upstairs)
                 Tyler... ?  What's this for?

     From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring
     ahead in subordinate military style.  He's in black pants,
     black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army
     surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.

                             JACK
                 Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?

     Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.

                             TYLER
                 You're too young.  Sorry.

                             JACK
                 Wait a minute...

     Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.

                             JACK
                 "Too young?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant is young, we tell
                 him he's too young.  Old, too old.
                 Fat, too fat.

                             JACK
                 "Applicant?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant waits at the door
                 for three days without food, shelter
                 or encouragement, then he can enter
                 and begin training.

                             JACK
                 "Training?"  Tyler...

     EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,
     unsure.  Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.

                             JACK
                 Uh, look.  You're too... young to...
                 train here.  You should probably be
                 on you way.

     No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.  Jack goes
     back inside.  Tyler closes the door.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky remains at attention.  Jack bursts out with a BROOM,
     knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.

                             JACK
                 Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!
                 You will never get inside this house!

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's still there.  Tyler comes out, friendly.

                             TYLER
                 Look, friend, I'm sorry for the
                 misunderstanding.  It's not the end
                 of the world.  Just go away.  You're
                 trespassing and I will call the
                 police.  Nothing personal.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky, same spot.  Jack bursts outside with the broom again.

                             JACK
                 You're never getting through this
                 door, you stupid little weasel!  Look
                 at me when I talk to you... !

     He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.

                             JACK
                 What is your major malfunction!?

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the
     PORCH below.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sooner or later, we all became what
                 Tyler wanted us to be.

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a
     paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out.
     Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the
     following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --

                             TYLER
                 You have two black shirts?  Two pair
                 black trousers?  One pair black
                 boots?  Two pair black socks?  One
                 black coat?  Three hundred dollars
                 personal burial money?  Go inside.

     Ricky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob.

                             TYLER
                 You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're
                 too fat.  Nice seeing you.

     Bob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and
     starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack
     follows Bob...

                             JACK
                 Bob... Bob, wait...
                       (leading Bob back)
                 Let me explain this to you...

     EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT

     CRICKETS CHIRP.  Bob stands at at rigid attention.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky
     finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR.  Tyler comes to give the
     top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP.

                             TYLER
                 A monkey, ready to be shot into
                 space.  A Space Monkey, ready to
                 sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.

     From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."

     EXT. PORCH - DAY

     Jack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's
     another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes
     out the front door with the BROOM...

                             RICKY
                       (to Bob)
                 You're too fucking old, fatty!  We
                 don't want your kind here!
                       (to short guy)
                 You're too short.  Go away, stumpy!
                 Go back to the circus!

     Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 So it went...

     EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

     Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the
     square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working
     with shovels, rakes, etc.  They cart away WHEELBARROWS of
     rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler built his army.

     IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 To what purpose, might one ask?
                 Well, one might ask, if not for the
                 first rule of Project Mayhem.

     Jack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS
     work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one
     SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In Tyler We Trust.

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY

     Jack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, then...

     INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY

     Jack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     The room is empty.  Jack stares.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was gone.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.

     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They
     pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off
     to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the
     wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's
     LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "You are not a beautiful and unique
                 snowflake.  You are the same decaying
                 organic matter as everything else.
                 We are all part of the same compost
                 heap."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Planet Tyler.

     Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world."

     Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had to hug the walls, trapped
                 inside this clockwork of Space
                 Monkeys, cooking and working and
                 sleeping in teams.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The house became a living thing, wet
                 inside from so many people sweating
                 and breathing.  So many people
                 moving, the house moved.

     Jack walks out.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Jack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.
     Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are
     lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under
     SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson."

     Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through
     a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 That wouldn't interest you.

                             JACK
                 Where's Tyler?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The first rule of Project --

                             JACK
                 Right, right.

     As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-
     BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.

     EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

     Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a
     Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a
     ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken
                 Heart.

     Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A
     Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.

                             JACK
                 Get away from me!

                             MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                 Who are all these people?

     Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.

                             JACK
                 The Paper Street Soap Company.

                             MARLA
                 Can I come in?

                             JACK
                 He's not here.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here
                 anymore!  He's gone away!

     Marla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her
     cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go.
     There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.
     Jack heads to the back door...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to
     the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating
     the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in
     BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.

                             JACK
                 What's going on?

     Space Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating,
     gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --
     it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.

                             JACK
                 Bob... oh, Christ...

     Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...

                             JACK
                 What... what happened... ?

                             MECHANIC
                       (out of breath)
                 We were on assignment...

     EXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     A SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We were supposed to kill two birds
                 with one stone:

     A SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 A piece of corporate art...

     The GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one
     parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and
     causing windows to explode...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 ... and trash a trendy coffee bar.

     Then, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL...
     BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the
     front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows...
     DECIMATING coffee push-pats...

     EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS)

     Bob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their
     handiwork.  They split up, running O.S.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We had it all worked out, man.  It
                 went smooth... until...

                             HARSH VOICE
                 Police!  Freeze!

     O.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING)

     The Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse.

                             MECHANIC
                 They shot Bob... they shot him in the
                 head.  Those fuckers...

     Jack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his
     head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 We gotta do something.

                             RICKY
                 We got to get rid of the evidence.
                 We have to get rid of this body.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 Bury him...

     Jack looks around in disbelief.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The garden.  Take him there.  Move,
                 people.  Let's do this!

     Several Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body.

                             JACK
                 No... !

     Space Monkeys stop.  Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES
     a few Space Monkeys back...

                             JACK
                 Get your hands off him!  Get off...!
                 What the hell do you think you're
                 doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a
                 man... !  You killed him!

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed in action.

                             JACK
                 No!  Look at you!  You're... you're
                 running around in ski masks,
                 exploding things...

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed serving Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY
                 It's what he would have wanted, sir.

                             JACK
                 What he wanted?  Look... look at him.
                 Look at him!  What does he want?
                       (wipes tears,
                        points at Bob)
                 This is a person.  This is not a cog
                 in your machine...

                             RICKY
                 But, this is Project Mayhem.

                             JACK
                 No, no.  This is a man -- this man
                 has a name...

                             RICKY
                 But, in Project Mayhem, we have no
                 names.

                             JACK
                 No!  Wrong!  This man's name is
                 Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY
                 Robert Paulson?

                 Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead,
                 because of you...

                             MECHANIC
                 I understand.

     Everyone just stares at Jack.

                             MECHANIC
                 In death, a member of Project Mayhem
                 has a name.

                             JACK
                 No -- !

                             MECHANIC
                 His name is Robert Paulson.

     Jack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room.

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers.
     He finds FLIGHT COUPONS, used and unused.  The used coupons.
     have the flight information, including the destination
     cities.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it...

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                             DETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE

                 unit.  I'd like to see you in my

     Jack hurries from the terminal, runs to a TAXI ...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In every city, I branched out from
                 the airport to downtown, bar-
                 hopping...

     Jack's looks out the window, intently watching buildings.

                             JACK (V.0.)
                 I didn't know how or why, but I could
                 look at fifty different bars, and
                 somehow I just knew...

                             JACK
                       (to driver, points)
                 Here.  Let me out, right here...

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  He sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT
     BRUISES.  Jack moves to the bar.  The BARTENDER has a broken
     arm and swollen face.

                             JACK
                 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

                             BARTENDER
                 Never heard of him.

                             JACK
                 This is an emergency.  It's important
                 I find him.

                             BARTENDER
                 I wish I could help you... sir.

     The bartender WINKS at Jack.

     Jack RUNS through the airport, lugging his suitcase.

                 Tyler was setting up franchises, all
                 over the country.

     INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

     The PROPRIETOR, his head bandaged, is confronted by Jack.

                             JACK
                 I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't
                 you help me?

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 Sir, you're disturbing the other
                 patrons with your laudish behavior.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 There's no one else here.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest
                 idea what you're talking about.

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I
                 just need to know if you've seen
                 Tyler Durden.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such
                 information to you, nor would I, even
                 if I had said information you want,
                 at this juncture be able.

     Jack looks around, incredibly frustrated.

                             JACK
                  You are a moron.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                  I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

     Jack gives up, shoves his way out the door.

     Jack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  The bus stops.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything I took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     OUT THE WINDOW, a CONSTRUCTION WORKER with a BROKEN NOSE
     works a jackhammer.  He stops, wipes his brow.

     INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

     TVs show football.  Jack is seated with TWO BRUISED PATRONS.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 No one's ever seen him.  No one knows
                 what he looks like.

                             BRUISED PATRON #2
                 He has facial reconstructive surgery
                 every three years.

                             JACK
                 That's the stupidest thing I've ever
                 heard.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 Is it true about fight club in Miami?

                             BRUISED PATRON 12
                 Is Mr. Durden building an army?

     solemnly stand in a circle, chanting...

                             KITCHEN WORKERS
                 His name is Robert Paulson.  His name

                 Welcome back, sir.

     Jack whirls, startled -- facing the wounded BARTENDER, who
     wears a NECK BRACE, his nose a smashed eggplant.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 How have you been?

                             JACK

                             JACK
                 Yes... it's a test.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You were in here last Thursday night.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You were standing right where you are
                 now, asking how good our security is.
                 It's tight as a drum.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think I am?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 Is this part of the test?

     Jack nods slowly.  The Bartender holds up his hand, shows
     the KISS SCAR on the back of his hand...

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You're the one who did this to me.
                 You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.

                             JACK (V.O.)

                 Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we
                 ever had sex?

                 What kind of stupid question is
                 that?!

                             JACK
                 Because the answer's "yes" or because
                 the answer's "no?"

                             MARLA
                 Is this a trick?

                 Will you just answer me, for
                 Christsake?!

                 You mean, you want to know if I think
                 we were just having sex or making
                 love?

                             JACK
                 We did make love?

                             MARLA
                 Is that what you're calling it?

                             JACK
                 Answer the question!

                             MARLA
                 You fuck me, then snub me.  You love
                 me, you hate me.  You show me your
                 sensitive side, then you turn into a
                 total asshole!  Is that a pretty
                 accurate description of our
                 relationship, Tyler?

                             JACK
                 What's this all about, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 And, we're definitely filling a void
                 in the rural South.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm you?

                             TYLER
                 You broke your promise.  You talked
                 to her about me.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

                             TYLER
                 Why did you do that?

                             JACK
                 Answer me, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Why do people think anything?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Tell me!

     Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated.

                             TYLER
                 People think that you're me, because
                 you and I happen to share the same
                 body.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Is this really news to you?

                 What are you talking about... ?

                             TYLER

                             TYLER
                 You can see me and hear me, but no
                 one else can...

     FLASHBACK - CURBSIDE - NIGHT

     JACK sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway.
     He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there.

                             JACK
                 Anyone?
                       (thinks)
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

     Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't really know my Dad...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 But, when you fall asleep, I do
                 things without you...

     FLASHBACK - TYLER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     JACK is on top of Marla, sweating, making violent love...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 I go places without you.  Get things
                 done...

     FLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT

     The Parker Morris Building.

     JACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the
     side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is "TYLER" in demeanor,
     mannerisms, speech...

                             JACK
                       (shouting)
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

     TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell:

                             BRUISED MAN #1
                 I am not my job!

                             BRUISED MAN #2
                 I am not how much money I have in the
                 bank!

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands.

                             TYLER
                 There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing
                 from you... one simple promise.  Now
                 look what you've done!

                             JACK
                 This isn't possible...

                             TYLER
                 We're going to have to do something
                 about Marla...

                             JACK
                 What... what are you saying?

                             TYLER
                 It's okay.  We okay... a little
                 codependent, sure, but...

     Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...

                             JACK
                 No!  This isn't true.  We... we were
                 around other people, together, both
                 of us...

                                  TYLER
                 You never talked to me in front of
                 anyone else.

                             JACK
                 Wrong, wrong -- what about the car
                 crash... the two guys in the backseat?

                             TYLER
                 What about them?  They're lunatics.

                             JACK
                 You took me to the house.

                             TYLER
                 The house is rented in your name.

                             JACK
                 You have jobs.

                             TYLER
                 Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

                             JACK
                 What about Marla?

                             TYLER
                 What about Marla?

                             JACK
                 She's... you... you're fucking her.

                             TYLER
                 Um, well... technically, no.

     Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find
     words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

     Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the
     previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at
     the clock -- 4:35am.

     INT. HALLWAY

     The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room,
     carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his
     suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him...

     INT. LOBBY

     Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken
     open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Please initial this list of phone
                 calls.

                             JACK
                 Bill me!

     Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going
     to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.

                             JACK
                 Wait...when were these made?

                             DESK CLERK
                 It says right there, sir... between
                 two and three-thirty this morning.

     Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.

                             JACK
                 I need a copy of this.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY

     Jack stares out the window, his face set hard.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Had I been going to bed earlier every
                 night?  Have I been sleeping later?
                 Has Tyler been in charge longer and
                 longer?

     EXT. PAPER STREET - DAY

     A TAXI halts.  Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE.

                             JACK
                 Wait here.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He
     continues on into the KITCHEN, gawks at BATHTUBS and
     CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES,
     GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS.

     He picks up a BOTTLE labeled "NITRIC ACID."

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM

     Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his
     finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Deja vu, all over again...

     Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear.

                             VOICE
                       (from phone)
                 Eighteen-eighty-eight.

     Jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 CENTURY PARK EAST."

                             JACK
                 Who is this?

                             VOICE
                 Maintenance.

                             JACK
                 Listen, something is going to happen,
                 something terrible...

                             VOICE
                 Very good, Sir.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?

                             VOICE
                 Don't worry about us, sir.  We're
                 solid.

                             JACK
                 Now wait, there's been a mix-up.
                 Everything's changed...

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 Abort the plan.

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist
                 dickhead?!

                             VOICE
                 Well, sir, you said you might.

     Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill.

                             DIFFERENT VOICE
                       (front phone)
                 Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.

     Jack sees a file: "2160 PICO BOULEVARD."  He throws the
     phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees
     Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...

                             JACK
                 Marla!

     Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows,
     hugging the files to his chest, catching up.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me
                 with a fucking broom.  I thought they
                 were going to break my arm.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, I...

                             MARLA
                 The were burning their fingertips
                 with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.

                             JACK
                 Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's
                 going to take a tremendous act of
                 faith on your part for you to hear me
                 out.

                             MARLA
                 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

     Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows...

                             JACK
                 -- A little more faith than that.

     INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her.

                             MARLA
                 I don't want to hear anything you've
                 got to say.

                             JACK
                 Give me a minute, Marla, alright...
                 just sixty seconds.

                             MARLA
                 Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.

                             JACK
                 Absolutely, you have every right.  I
                 need you to do me a favor.

                             MARLA
                 I've done you enough favors.

     A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table.

                             WAITER
                 Sir!  Anything you order is free of
                 charge, sir.

                             MARLA
                 Why is it free of charge?

                             JACK
                 Because... I'm Tyler Durden.

                             MARLA
                 Then, I'll have the clam chowder...
                 fried chicken and a baked potato with
                 everything and a chocolate chiffon
                 pie.

     Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where
     THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces.

                             JACK
                 Clean food, please.

                             WAITER
                 In that case, sir, may I advise
                 against the lady eating the clam
                 chowder?

                             JACK
                 Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it.

     The waiter snaps to attention and leaves.

                             MARLA
                 You got about thirty seconds.

                             JACK
                       (takes a deep breath)
                 I know that I've been... unwell.  I
                 know it's been like there's two sides
                 to me.

                             MARLA
                 Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr.
                 Jackass.

                             JACK
                 I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've
                 only just realized

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 I mean, the depth and breadth of our
                 relationship has only recently been
                 illuminated for me.  I know this...
                 I know us hasn't been such a great
                 thing for you...

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.
                       (to waiter)
                 I'll take my food to go...

     Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her
     by the arm, putting her back in her seat.

                             JACK
                 Sit down!  Sit down and give me my
                 last fifteen seconds without opening
                 your mouth!

     Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself.

                             JACK
                 I'm trying to tell you -- and this is
                 where you have to trust me -- but, I
                 think your life might be in real
                 danger.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 You have to get out of here.  Leave
                 as soon as possible.  Go to any rural
                 town, away from any major city...

                             MARLA
                 You are an insane person.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 No, no, shut up!  I've had enough.
                 I tried, Tyler... I have tried...

     Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.

                             MARLA
                 There's a part of you I really like,
                 but I can't do this anymore.  I just
                 can't.  This is killing me...

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, but I...

                             MARLA
                 What?!  You're sorry?  I don't
                 believe that for a minute.

     Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading
     for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...

     EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER

     Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...

                             JACK
                 I can't explain.  You wouldn't
                 believe me anyway.  I'm trying to
                 protect you...

     Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races
     past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,

                             MARLA
                 Let go of me!

                             JACK
                 Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for
                 me, if you never do anything else...

     Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.

                             MARLA
                 Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to
                 see you again!

                             JACK
                 Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
                 never have to see me again.
                       (digs in his pocket)
                 Here... here...

     He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.

                             JACK
                 Take this money, get on this bus...
                       (pointing to bus)
                 Get on, and I promise you, I'll never
                 bother you again, if that's what you
                 want.  Please...

     Marla looks at Jack, numb.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

                             JACK
                 I'm begging you.  Get on the bus.
                 Get on the bus.

     Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As
     they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...

                             MARLA
                 Why are you doing this?

                             JACK
                 I can't let myself see where you're
                 going.  Go wherever it takes you,
                 remember... keep away from major
                 cities...

     Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
     last look at Jack.

                             MARLA
                       (holds up the money)
                 I'm not paying this back.  I consider
                 it "asshole tax."

                             JACK
                 Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away
                 a couple of weeks, at least.

     Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

     Jack finally looks to her.

                             MARLA
                 You are the worst thing that ever
                 happened to me.

     DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems
     relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...

     Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is
     filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.

     Jack SPRINTS after the bus...

     The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.

     Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.

                             JACK
                 Son of a bitch!

     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of
     files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...

                             JACK
                       (loudly)
                 I want you to arrest me.  I'm the
                 leader of a terrorist organization
                 responsible for acts of vandalism all
                 over the city.  Detective Stern in
                 arson knows who I am...

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,
     who's seated.  On the table are the phone bill and files.

                             JACK
                 There are probably several hundred
                 members in the metropolitan area.
                 Chapters are sprouting in at least
                 five other major cities.  They're
                 tightly-regimented, with many cells
                 capable of operating without a
                 central leader.  Check this address:
                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the
                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the
                 garden.  You'll also find numerous
                 tubs used to make gallons of
                 nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,
                 is to blow up these credit card
                 headquarters and the TRW building.

                             STERN
                 Why these buildings?

                             JACK
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

                             STERN
                       (to other detectives)
                 Keep him talking.

     Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile
     at Jack with REVERENCE.

                             FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE
                 I really admire what you're doing.
                 You're a brave man to order this.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             REDHEAD DETECTIVE
                 You're a genius, sir.

     They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.
     Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.

                             BALD DETECTIVE
                 You know the drill.  You said if
                 anyone ever tries to interfere with
                 Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
                 get his balls.

     Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them
     aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.

                             FLAT-TOP
                 It's useless to fight.

                             REDHEAD
                 This is really a powerful gesture,
                 Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an
                 example.

                             JACK
                 No... you're making a mistake!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You told us you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 I'm not Tyler Durden!

                             BALDY
                 You told us you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm
                 ordering you to abort the mission!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You said you would definitely say
                 that.

                             BALDY
                 What's our best time for a "cut and
                 run?"

                             FLAT-TOP
                 Four minutes.

                             BALDY
                 Is somebody timing this?

                             REDHEAD
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Wait till the second hand gets to the
                 twelve.

     A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's
     mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy
     opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:

                             STERN
                 Some of this info checks out.  Let's
                 go to the place on Paper Street.

     Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing
     the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks
     and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but
     with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.

                             REDHEAD
                       (checking his watch)
                 Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up
                 the time!

     Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --
     Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of
     Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting
     off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...

     Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN
     and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,
     gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.

     Jack grabs one of the files off the table.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK
     DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.

     EXT. STREET

     Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,
     looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him.

     EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER

     Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads
     toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."

     EXT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench,
     runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench
     immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!
     Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.
     Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...

     INT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the
     "PARKING" door...

     INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING

     Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS...

     INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR

     Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one
     SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies,
     across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.

     Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.
     There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...

     Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse...

     Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.

                             TYLER
                 You could be standing under 37
                 stories of steel and concrete with a
                 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped
                 to the support... oh, maybe it
                 couldn't be...

                             JACK
                       (points at bomb)
                 You... you can't be serious about
                 this.

                             TYLER
                 What a ridiculous thing to say.

                             JACK
                 I can't let you...

                             TYLER
                              ...go through with this?
                 What are you going to do?

                             JACK
                 I'm going to...

                             TYLER
                           ...stop me?

                             JACK
                 I'm not going...

                             TYLER
                            ...to let this happen!

                             JACK
                 Stop finishing...

                             TYLER
                         ...your sentences!  They're
                 our sentences.  Get your mind around
                 that.

     Tyler gets up walks to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing running through
                 the streets in your underpants?  We
                 both use that body.

                             JACK
                 Since when is Project Mayhem about
                 murder?

                             TYLER
                 The buildings were evacuated thirty
                 minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding
                 exactly as planned.

                             JACK
                 You don't know that.  There could
                 still be people inside.

     Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.

                             TYLER
                 Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with
                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize
                 their watches.  Good riddance.

     Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his
     face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.

                             TYLER
                 I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you
                 know which wires, in what order...

                             JACK
                 If you know, I know.

     Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go
     through the tangle of colored wires.

                             TYLER
                 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I
                 spent the whole day thinking about
                 the wrong ones.

     Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.

                             JACK
                 If I'm wrong, we're both dead..

                             TYLER
                 This is not about martyrdom.

     Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.

                             JACK
                 I'm pulling the green wire.

                             TYLER
                 Green?  Did you say green?

     Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,
     seems genuinely concerned.

                             JACK
                 Yes...

                             TYLER
                 Don't pull the green wire.  Pull
                 anything but the green wire.

                             JACK
                 Fuck you.

                             TYLER
                 I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

     Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers
     trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...

                             TYLER
                 Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in
                 the nick of time, eh?

     Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...

                             TYLER
                 See for yourself.

     Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,
     keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...

     BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,
     kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...

                             MARLA
                 You motherfuckers...

     They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.

     Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.

                             TYLER
                 I've got everything.  The bombs.  The
                 army.  I've got Marla.

                             JACK
                 Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew
                 a hole in his head.  Was that part of
                 your plan?

     Tyler thinks, shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Bob was a grown man.  In any great
                 struggle, there will be casualties.
                 Wouldn't that be implicit in the
                 name?  Project "Mayhem."

                             JACK
                 Fuck your struggle.  I want out.

                             TYLER
                 You want out?

                             JACK
                 I quit.

                             TYLER
                 Not an option, for the most obvious
                 of reasons.  You need to get with the
                 program.
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.

     Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He
     points the gun at Tyler...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                       (still walking away)
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (COCKS the gun)
                 Defuse the bomb.

     Tyler stops walking.

                             TYLER
                 Ask me nicely.

                             JACK
                 Defuse the bomb, please.

                             TYLER
                 Defuse the bomb?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...

                             JACK
                 Please.

     Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the
     GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.

     Jack lowers his gun.

                             TYLER
                 I did that for you.  As a gesture.
                 Now, how fast can you run?  There are
                 ten other bombs, in ten other
                 buildings in the immediate area.  If
                 you're going to get them all, you
                 better get cracking.
                       (looks at watch)
                 Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.
                 I'll be upstairs.

     Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past
     Jack, heading for the STAIRS.

     Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!

     Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

     Tyler spins to face Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Whoa!  What was that all about?

     Jack aims... FIRES!

     Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.

     Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the
     post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps,
     moving the gun from side to side...

     Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.

     Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...

     Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun,
     scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...

     Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.

     Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run
     into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack
     RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM
     down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor.

     Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his
     gun...

                             TYLER
                 Fire at will.

     Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.
     Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms.

                             TYLER
                 What did you expect?

     Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of
     Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking
     each other to the floor...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.

     ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,
     alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up,
     punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING
     himself in the side of the head...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to
     get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's
     head against the floor...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his
     own head against the floor, over and over...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.
     Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.

     Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...

     ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the
     lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind,
     turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.

     Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He
     wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack
     turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls
     against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,
     SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...

     Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head
     on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR

     CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He
     looks around, trying to focus his eyes...

     JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from
     where his body was dragged across to where he is how.

     CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head --
     TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S
     MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...

                                                      PULL BACK TO:

     Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in
     Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being
     remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling
     windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.

     Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I think this is about where we came
                 in.

                             TYLER
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I still can't think of anything.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

     Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplished.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.
                       (looks out windows)
                 Out these windows, we will view the
                 economic collapse.  One step closer
                 to global equilibrium.  I'm glad
                 you're here with me.

     Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.

                             JACK
                       (distorted)
                 Can't you call it off... ?

                             TYLER
                 It's out of our hands.
                       (looks at watch)
                 This is it.

                             JACK
                 Please...

                             TYLER
                 Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see
                 alright?  10... 9... 8....

     Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,
     excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing.

                             TYLER
                 5... 4... 3... 2...

     Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A
     long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.

     Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely
     surprised, pissed-off.

                             TYLER
                 What the fuck -- ?

                             JACK
                 Paraffin.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (relieved)
                 Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the
                 nitro with paraffin.  I saw it
                 floating in the bomb.
                             (more)

                             JACK (cont)
                 They must've run out of cotton and
                 Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best.

     Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts
     pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.

                             TYLER
                 Damn it!  God-damn it...

                             JACK
                 Not exactly according to plan.

                             TYLER
                 Do we have to do everything
                 ourselves?!

     Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches
     into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 ... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First
                 Strike...

     Jack's eyes go wide.

                             JACK
                 NO...

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 Proceed with remote detonation.

     Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack
     STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles
     off...

     Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to
     his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.

                             TYLER
                 Haven't we already done this?

     Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.
     Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the
     floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking
                 figment of my imagination... you're
                 psychogenic fugue state...

                             TYLER
                 Fuck that, maybe you're my
                 hallucination.

     Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie-
     talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE
     CRUSHED under his own foot.

                             JACK
                 Oh... Christ...

     Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.

                             JACK
                 Why... why... why... ?

                             TYLER
                 Why what?

                             JACK
                 Why can't I get rid of you?  Why
                 can't I just wish you away?

                             TYLER
                 You need me.

                             JACK
                 No, no, I don't.
                       (pause)
                 I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,
                 but I don't need you anymore.

                             TYLER
                 Look, I can be selfish, I know that.
                       (pause)
                 I'm not blind to my own failings...

                             JACK
                 Noooo, please...

     Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.

                             TYLER
                 From now on, we'll share Marla.
                 We've been spending too much time
                 apart...

                             JACK
                 ... no, no, no...

                             TYLER
                 No more running off without you.
                 From here on out, we do it together.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?!

                             TYLER
                 I'm doing this for us.

                             JACK
                 Please understand... I've gotten all
                 I can from this, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                       (sullen)
                 If I leave, you will be right back
                 where I found you...

                             JACK
                 I swear on my life, I won't...

                             TYLER
                 You will.  You know you will.

     Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head.  He
     looks at the gun in his hand...

                             TYLER
                 Can you live with that?

     Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...

     Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.

     Tyler cocks his head.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

                             JACK
                 What have you left for me?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you want to do that? Why do
                 you want to put that gun in your
                 mouth?

                             JACK
                 Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

     Tyler is calm.

                             TYLER
                 This is interesting.

     Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands
     very close to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Why are you going with this, Ikea-
                 boy?

                             JACK
                 It's the only way to get rid of you...

     Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.

                             TYLER
                 I can see you feel very strongly.  I
                 feel strongly too.
                       (pause)
                 Hey, you and me.
                       (pause)
                 Friends again?

     Their eyes are locked, unblinking.  Long silence.

                             JACK
                 Do something for me.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Appreciate something.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Look at me...

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 My eyes are open.

     EXTREME SLOW MOTION:

     Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...

     KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.
     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him
     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.

     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...

     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...

                             TYLER
                 What's that smell... ?

     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...

     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN
     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,
     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.

                             TALL SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you all right, sir... ?!

     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole
     blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.

                             JACK
                 I'm okay...

     Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to
     see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun
     to Marla as she struggles.

                             SHORT SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you sure?  You look terrible,
                 sir!  What's happened?

                             JACK
                 Everything's fine.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 Sir, you look really awful!  Do you
                 need medical assistance?

     Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...

                             JACK
                 Bring the girl to me.  The rest of
                 you get out.  Now!

     The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.

                             MARLA
                 What happened... ?

                             JACK
                 Don't ask.

     Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.
     them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.

                             JACK
                 Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!

     Jack and Marla are left alone.

                             MARLA
                 My God, you're shot...

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.

                             MARLA
                 Who did this to you?

                             JACK
                 I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm
                 fine...

     MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...

     Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;
     collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES
     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are
     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,
     reaches to take her hand.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry... you met me at a very
                 strange time in my life.

     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES
     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...

     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING
     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING
     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING
     BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket
     holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

     SCREEN BLACK

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 People were always asking me, did I
                 know Tyler Durden.

     FADE IN:

     INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

     TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With a gun barrel between your teeth,
                 you only speak in vowels.

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I can't think of anything.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With my tongue, I can feel the
                 rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
                 controlled demolition thing and I
                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 That old saying, how you always hurt
                 the one you love, well, it works both
                 way.

     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We have front row seats for this
                 Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
                 Demolitions Committee of Project
                 Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
                 of ten buildings with blasting
                 gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
                 charges will blow base charges, and
                 those buildings will be reduced to
                 smoldering rubble.  I know this
                 because Tyler knows this.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplised.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
                 really about Marla Singer.

     PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE
     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is
     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob had bitch tits.

     PULL BACK to wide on...

     INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This was a support group for men with
                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie
                 slobbering all over me was Bob.

                             BOB
                 We're still men.

                             JACK
                 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
                 developed bitch tits because his
                 testosterone was too high and his
                 body upped the estrogen.  That was
                 where my head fit -- into his huge,
                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the
                 way we think of God's as big.

                             BOB
                 They're gonna have to open my pec's
                 again to drain the fluid.

     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

                             BOB
                 Okay.  You cry now.

     Jack looks at Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For six months.  I could not sleep.

     INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup
     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With insomnia, nothing is real.
                 Everything is far away.  Everything
                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.
     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

     Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the
     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When deep space exploration ramps up,
                 it will be corporations that name
                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.
                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet
                 Starbucks.

     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks
     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 I'm going to need you out-of-town a
                 little more this week.  We've got
                 some "red-flags" to cover.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It must've been Tuesday.  he was
                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

                             JACK
                       (listless management speak)
                 You want me to de-prioritize my
                 current reports until you advise of
                 a status upgrade?

                             BOSS
                 You need to make these your primary
                 "action items."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was full of pep.  Must've had his
                 grande latte enema.

                             BOSS
                 Here are your flight coupons.  Call
                 me from the road if there are any
                 snags.  Your itinerary...

     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.

     INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT

     Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips
     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy
     magazines and other catalogs nearby.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like everyone else, I had become a
                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika
                 Pekkari slip covers.

     Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

     MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I saw something like clever coffee
                 table sin the shape of a yin and
                 yang, I had to have it.

     PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
                 Strinne green stripe pattern...

     INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN

     The armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
                 environmentally-friendly unbleached
                 paper.

     The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even the Vild hall clock of
                 galvanized steel, resting on the
                 Klipsk shelving unit.

     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I would flip through catalogs and
                 wonder, "What kind of dining set
                 defines me as a person?"  We used to
                 read pornography.  Now it was the
                 Horchow Collection.

     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still
     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.

                             JACK
                 No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that
                 sounds nice.  Apricot.

     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had it all.  Even the glass dishes
                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
                 proof they were crafted by the
                 honest, simple, hard-working
                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically
     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
     a butter knife to eat it.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who
     studies him with bemusement.

                             INTERN
                 No, you can't die of insomnia.

                             JACK
                 Maybe I died already.  Look at my
                 face.

                             INTERN
                 You need to lighten up.

                             JACK
                 Can't you give me something?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
                 Seconals.

                             INTERN
                       (overlapping w/ above)
                 You need healthy, natural sleep.
                 Chew valerian root and get some more
                 exercise.

     The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...

     INT. HALLWAY

     The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.

                             JACK
                 I'm in pain.

                             INTERN
                       (facetious)
                 You want to see pain?  Swing by First
                 Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the
                 guys with testicular cancer.  That's
                 pain.

     The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack heads for the front door.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER
     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

                             SPEAKER
                 I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and
                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and
                 one boy.  We never could agree on
                 anything.

     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to
     lighten the mood.

                             SPEAKER
                 Well, she had her first child a month
                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...
                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,
                 because she deserves...

     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,
     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.

                             LEADER
                 Everyone, let's thank Thomas for
                 sharing himself with us.

     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:

                             EVERYONE
                       (in unison)
                 Thank you, Thomas.

                             LEADER
                 I look around this room and I see a
                 lot of courage.  And it gives me
                 strength.  We give each other
                 strength.

     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
     Jack squirms in his seat.

                             LEADER
                 It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's
                 follow Thomas's example and open
                 ourselves.

     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
     Jack stands, uncomfortable.

                             LEADER
                 Can everyone find a partner?

     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,
     shuffling his feet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The big moosie, his eyes already
                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
                 together, invisible steps.

     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You
                 know that chest expansion program you
                 see on TV?  That was his idea.

                             BOB
                 ...using steroids.  I was a juicer.
                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm
                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
                 won't return my calls...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Strangers with this kind of honesty
                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder
     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of
     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.

                             BOB
                 Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then... something happened.  I was
                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
                 and complete.

     Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens
     his arms around Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I found freedom.  Losing all hope was
                 freedom.

     Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET
     MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Babies don't sleep this well.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies sound asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became addicted.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and
     women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to
     cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I didn't say anything, people
                 assumed the worst.  They cried
                 harder.  I cried harder.

     INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES
     CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Tonight, we're going to open the
                 green door -- the heart chakra...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
                 to cancer or parasites; I was the
                 warm little center that the life of
                 this world crowded around.

                             LEADER
                 ...And you open the door and you
                 step inside.  We're inside our
                 hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a
                 white ball of healing light.  That's
                 right, the pain itself is a ball of
                 healing light.

     Jack, eyes closed, is silent...

                             LEADER
                 It moves over your body, healing you.
                 Keep this going and step forward,
                 through the back door of the room.
                 Where does it lead?  To your cave.
                 Step forward into your cave.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...

                             LEADER'S VOICE
                 That's right.  You're going deeper
                 into your cave.  And you're going to
                 find your power animal...

     Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks
     his head to signal Jack forward.

                             PENGUIN
                 Slide.

     The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He
     walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every evening I died and every
                 evening I was born again.  Resurrected.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob loved me because he thought my
                 testicles were removed too.  Being
                 there, my face against his tits,
                 ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

     MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and
     big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, she ruined everything.

     Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.

                             MARLA
                 This is cancer, right?

     Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER

     Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE
     as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.
     She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...
                 did not have testicular cancer.  She
                 was a liar.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while
     a member speaks.  Jack spies on her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She had no diseases at all.  I had
                 seen her at my melanoma Monday night
                 group ...

     INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down
     the row are turned toward her, incredulous...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood
                 parasites group Thursdays.

     Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my
                 tuberculosis Friday night.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

     Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the
     shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes,
     catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie
                 reflected my lie.

     Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down
     her cheeks.  She wipes at them.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack
     exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I
                 couldn't cry.  So, once again, I
                 could not sleep.

     Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATER

     Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling
     IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No, I just can't believe that card is
                 declined -- Okay, okay, let me give
                 you a different card number.

     Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card
     and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Next group, after guided meditation,
                 after we open our chakras, when it's
                 time to hug, I'm going to grab that
                 little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her
                 arms against her sides and say...

     INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     CLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.

                             JACK
                 Marla, you liar, you big tourist.  I
                 need this.  Get out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When you have insomnia, you're never
                 really asleep and you're never really
                 awake.  I hadn't slept in four days...

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  People
     are chattering with each other.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- But, in here, in everyone, there's
                 the squint of a five-day headache.
                 Yet they forced themselves to be
                 positive.  They never said
                 "parasite;" they said "agent."  They
                 always talked about getting better.

                             LEADER
                 Okay, everyone.

     Everyone sits in chairs.  Jack catches sight of Marla.

                             LEADER
                 To open tonight's communion, Chloe
                 would like to say a few words.

     Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin
     stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  She wears a
     head bondage.  She clears her throat.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way
                 Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look
                 if you made it smile and walk around
                 a party being extra nice to everyone.

                             CHLOE
                 Well, I'm still here -- but I don't
                 know for how long.  That's as much
                 certainty as anyone can give me.  but
                 I've got some good news -- I no
                 longer have any fear of death.

     APPLAUSE from around the room.

                             CHLOE
                 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
                 No one will have sex with me.  I'm so
                 close to the end and all I want is to
                 get laid for the last time.  I have
                 pornographic movies in my apartment,
                 and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

     The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Thank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's
                 thank Chloe.

                             EVERYONE
                 Thank you, Chloe.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

                             LEADER
                 Now, you're standing at the entrance
                 to your cave.  You step inside your
                 cave and you walk.  Keep walking.

     Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I did have a tumor, I'd name it
                 Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on
                 the roof of your mouth that would
                 heal if only you could stop tonguing
                 it, but you can't.

                             LEADER
                 Now, find your power animal.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette.  Marla cocks her head,
     indicating whe wants him to --

                             MARLA
                 Slide.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING

     Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke
     rings with her eyes closed.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

     Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.

                             LEADER
                 Pick someone special to you tonight.

     Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him.
     He tries to smile.  She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.

                             CHLOE
                 Hello, Mr. Tayler.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I never gave my real name at support
                 groups.

                             JACK
                 Hi, Chloe.

                             CHLOE
                 We've never actually talked.

     Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation.  Jack, in
     a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

                             JACK
                 You look good.  You ... look ... like
                 a pirate.

     Chloe laughs, a little too much.  Jack squeezes out a laugh.
     Then he sees Marla, off by herself.  Someone heads for her.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me, I have to...

     Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla.
     Chloe watches him go.

     STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her.
     He whispers into her ear.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             MARLA
                 Sure.

                             JACK
                 I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You
                 aren't dying.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy
                 way, we're all dying.  But you're not
                 dying the way Chloe is dying.

                             LEADER
                 Tell the other person how you feel.

                             JACK
                 You're a tourist.  I saw you at
                 melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular
                 cancer.

                             MARLA
                 And I saw you practicing this...

                             JACK
                 Practicing what?

                             MARLA
                 Telling me off.  Is it going as well
                 as you hoped... ?
                       (reads his nametag)
                 "... Mr. Taylor."

                             JACK
                 I'll expose you.

                             MARLA
                 Go ahead.  I'll expose you.

                             LEADER
                 Share yourself completely.

     Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were
     crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?

                             MARLA
                 It's cheaper than a movie, and
                 there's free coffee.

                             JACK
                 These are my groups.  I was here
                 first.  I've been coming for a year.

                             MARLA
                 A year?  How'd you manage that?

                             JACK
                 Anyone who might've noticed either
                 died or recovered and never came back.

                             LEADER
                 Let yourself cry.

                             MARLA
                 Why do you do it?

                             JACK
                 I... I don't know.  I guess... when
                 people think you're dying, they
                 really listen, instead...

                             MARLA
                 -- Instead of just waiting for their
                 turn to speak.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

     Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.

                             LEADER
                 Quietly, now.  Share with each other.

     Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.

                             JACK
                       (warning)
                 It becomes an addiction.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

     Jack sighs, then pulls back.

                             JACK
                 Look, I can't cry with a faker
                 present.

                             MARLA
                 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not
                 my problem.

                             JACK
                 Please.  Can't we do something... ?

     Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her.

                             LEADER
                 Now, the closing prayer.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

                             JACK
                 We'll split up the week.  You can
                 have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --

                             MARLA
                 You take tuberculosis.  My smoking
                 doesn't go over at all.

                             JACK
                 I think testicular cancer should be
                 no contest.

                             MARLA
                 Well, technically, I have more of a
                 right to be there than you.  You
                 still have your balls.

                             JACK
                 You're kidding.

                             MARLA
                 I don't know -- am I?

     Jack follow Marla into...

     INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She
     takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.

                             MARLA
                 I'll take the parasites.

                             JACK
                 You can't have both parasites.  You
                 can take blood parasites --

                             MARLA
                 I want brain parasites.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and
                 organic brain dementia --

                             MARLA
                 I want that.

                             JACK
                 You can't have the whole brain!

                             MARLA
                 So far, you have four and I only have
                 two!

                             JACK
                 Then, take blood parasites.  It's
                 yours.  Now we each have three.

     Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack follows, bewildered.

                             JACK
                 You... left half your clothes.

     HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with
     traffic barreling down.

     Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS
     BLARING.  Jack dashes, following...

     INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

     Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK
     sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.

                             JACK
                 You're selling those?

     Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain.

                             MARLA
                       (for the Clerk to hear)
                 Yes, I'm selling some chothes.

     The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.

                             MARLA
                 So, we each have three -- that's six.
                 What about the seventh day?  I want
                 ascending bowel cancer.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The girl had done her homework.

                             JACK
                 I want ascending bowel cancer.

     The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.

                             MARLA
                 That's your favorite, too?  Tried to
                 slip it by me, eh?

                             JACK
                 We'll split it.  You get it the first
                 and third Sunday of the month.

                             MARLA
                 Deal.

     They shake.  Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.

                             MARLA
                 Looks like this is goodbye.

                             JACK
                 Let's not make a big thing out of it.

     She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.

                             MARLA
                 How's this for not making a big thing?

     Jack watches her go.  A moment, then he follows after...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

                             JACK
                 Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
                 numbers?

                             MARLA
                 Should we?

                             JACK
                 In case we want to switch nights.

                             MARLA
                 I suppose.

     Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
     back, hands it to her.  She takes the pen, grabs his hand
     and writes her number on his palm.  She walks into the
     street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.  She turns,
     holds up the card.

                             MARLA
                 It doesn't have your name.  Who are
                 you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.
                 Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you
                 give each night?

     Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
     Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  A BUS
     moves into view, obscuring her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met Marla Singer.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     The plane touches down; the cabin BUMPS.  Jack's eyes open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at O'Hare.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at SeaTac.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

     The rear of a CRASHED CAR sticks up by the side of the road.
     Jack stands, marking on a clipboard.  The SUN SETS behind.

     INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Jack stands at a gate counter.  An ATTENDANT smiles at him.

                             ATTENDANT
                 Check-in for that flight doesn't
                 begin for another two hours, Sir.

     Jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and
     looks at an overhanging CLOCK.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an
                 hour, gain an hour.  This is your
                 life, and it's ending one minute at
                 a time.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack's eyes snap open as the plane LANDS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Air Harbor
                 International.

     INT. AIRPORT WALKWAY

     Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet.  He
     watches PEOPLE MOVING PAST on the opposite conveyor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you wake up at a different time
                 and in a different place, could you
                 wake up as a different person?

     Jack misses seeing TYLER on the opposite conveyor belt.
     They pass each other.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN.  As they have idle
     CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's tray.  An ATTENDANT'S
     HANDS set coffee down with a small container of cream.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.
                 Single-serving sugar, single-serving
                 cream, single pat of butter.

                                                      CUT TO:

     HANDS place a dinner tray down.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth in the MIRROR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-
                 serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

     Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He
     moves out of the bathroom into...

     MAIN ROOM

     Jack sits on the bed.  He turns on the TV.  It's tuned to
     the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a
     large BANQUET ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels
     something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN.  They chat.  Jack turns to
     look at his food, takes a bite.  He turns back and it's...

     --a BALD MAN next to him, talking.  Jack takes another bite,
     turns back and it's...

     --a BUSINESSMAN next to him.  Jack takes another bite, turns
     back, and it's...

     --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people I meet on each flight --
                 they're single-serving friends.
                 Between take-off and landing, we have
                 our time together, but that's all we
                 get.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING

     Jack's eyes snap open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Logan.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

     Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a
     WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it
     and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is
                 to apply the formula.  It's a story
                 problem.

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 Here's where the infant went through
                 the windshield.  Three points.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A new car built by my company leaves
                 somewhere traveling at 60 miles per
                 hour.  The rear differential locks up.

                             TECHNICIAN #2
                 The teenager's braces around the
                 backseat ashtray would make a good
                 "anti-smoking" ad.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The car crashes and burns with
                 everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we
                 initiate a recall?

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 The father must've been huge.  See
                 how the fat burnt into the driver's
                 seat with his polyester shirt?  Very
                 "modern art."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Take the number of vehicles in the
                 field, (A), and multiply it by the
                 probable rate of failure, (B), then
                 multiply the result by the average
                 out-of-court settlement, (C).  A
                 times B times C equals X...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY

     Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.

                             JACK
                 If X is less than the cost of a
                 recall, we don't do one.

                             BUSISNESS WOMAN
                 Are there a lot of these kinds of
                 accidents?

                             JACK
                 Oh, you wouldn't believe.

                             BUSINESS WOMAN
                 ... Which... car company do you work
                 for?

                             JACK
                 A major one.

     Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a
     PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every time the plane banked too
                 sharply on take-off or landing, I
                 prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
                 collision -- anything.

     Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane
     BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,
                 not even bad breath.

     The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are
     sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering
     wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Life insurance pays off triple if you
                 die on a business trip.

     Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.

     DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE.
     EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their
     seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...

                             VOICE
                 There are three ways to make napalm.
                 One, mix equal parts of gasoline and
                 frozen orange juice...

     Jack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler
     continues:

                             TYLER
                 Two, equal parts gasoline and diet
                 cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter
                 in gasoline until the mixture is
                 thick.

                             JACK
                 Pardon me?

     Tyler turns to Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met --

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it.

                             TYLER
                 You know why they have oxygen masks
                 on planes?

                             JACK
                 No, supply oxygen?

                             TYLER
                 Oxygen gets you high.  In a
                 catastrophic emergency, we're taking
                 giant, panicked breaths...

     Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback,
     hands it to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Suddenly, we become euphoic and
                 docile.  We accept our fate.

     Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.

                             TYLER
                 Emergency water landing, 600 miles
                 per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as
                 Hindu cows.

     Jack laughs.

                             JACK
                 What do you do, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 What do you want me to do?

                             JACK
                 I mean -- for a living.

                             TYLER
                 Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's
                 what you do." -- And be a smug little
                 shit about it?

     Jack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him
     and lifts a BRIEFCASE.

                             TYLER
                 You have a kind of sick desperation
                 in your laugh.

     Jack points to his own briefcase.

                             JACK
                 We have the same briefcase.

     Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Open it.

     Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the
     lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.

                             TYLER
                 Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
                       (reaches in his pocket)
                 I make and sell soap...

     Tyler hands Jack his card.  "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."

                             TYLER
                 If you were to add nitric acid to the
                 soap-making process, one would get
                 nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one
                 could blow up the world, if one were
                 so inclined.

     Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares.

                             JACK
                 Tyler, you are by far the most
                 interesting "single-serving" friend
                 I've ever met.

     Tyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be
     witty, leans closer to Tyler.

                             JACK
                 You see, when you travel, everything
                 is small, self-contained--

                             TYLER
                 The spork.  I get it.  You're very
                 clever.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 How's that working out for you?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Being clever.

                             JACK
                       (thrown)
                 Well, uh... great.

                             TYLER
                 Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

     Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.

                             TYLER
                 ... As I squeeze past, do I give you
                 the ass or the crotch?

     Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...

                             TYLER
                 We are defined by the choices we make.

     Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the
     curtain aside and sits in an empty seat.  Jack watches.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How I came to live with Tyler is:
                 airlines have this policy about
                 vibrating luggage.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT

     Utterly empty of baggage.  No people except for Jack and a
     SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN.  The Security TFM, smirking, holds
     a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (to Jack)
                 Throwers don't worry about ticking.
                 Modern bombs don't tick.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?  "Throwers?"

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Baggage handlers.  But when a
                 suitcase vibrates, the throwers have
                 to call the police.

                             JACK
                 My suitcase was vibrating?

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Nine time out of ten, it's an
                 electric razor.  But, every once in
                 a while ...
                       (whispers)
                 ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy
                 not to imply ownership in the event
                 of a dildo.  We use the indefinite
                 aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your
                 dildo."

     Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing
     his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE.
     Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS
     OUT.  jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM.

     In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the
     convertible, SCREAMING.

                             JACK
                       (to Security TFM)
                 I had everything in that bag.  My
                 C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (into phone)
                 Yeah, uh huh... yeah?
                       (pause, still on phone)
                 Oh...

     EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY

     A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete.  SECURITY PERSONNEL
     keep their distance.  KABOOM!  The suitcase explodes.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING

     The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 I'm terribly sorry.

     The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form.  Jack snatches it,
     disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 You know the industry slang for
                 "Flight Attendant?"  "Air Mattress."

     INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

     Along a residential street.  Jack looks ahead, sees a tall,
     grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Home was a condo on the fifteenth
                 floor of a filing cabinet for widows
                 and young professionals.  The walls
                 were solid concrete.  A foot of
                 concrete is important when your next-
                 door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
                 and has to watch game shows at full
                 volume...

     The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the
     building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-
     OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS
     and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris
                 that used to be your furniture and
                 personal effects blows out your floor-
                 to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
                 into the night.

     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

     Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the
     Cabbie money.  The taxi pulls away.  Jack starts toward the
     building.  He pushes through the fray of people, into the...

     INT. LOBBY

     The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his
     head.  Jack starts for the elevator.

                             DOORMAN
                 There's nothing up there.

     Jack presses the button.  The Doorman moves next to him.

                             DOORMAN
                 You can't go into the unit.  Police
                 orders.

     The elevator doors open.  Jack hesitates.  The doors close.
     Jack heads out the lobby doors.  The Doorman follows...

     EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE
     from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part
     of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.  His feet CRUNCH glass.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How embarrassing.

                             DOORMAN
                 Do you have somebody you can call?

     Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.  He
     reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone
     number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE

     Hissing.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The police would later tell me that
                 the pilot light might have gone
                 out... letting out just a little bit
                 of gas.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack gets to a PAYPHONE.  The Doorman follows, watching him.

                             DOORMAN
                 Lots of young people try to impress
                 the world and buy too many things.

     Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter.  He looks at
     Marla's number a long moment.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM

     The SOUND of the HISS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The gas could have slowly filled the
                 condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet
                 with high ceilings, for days and days.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs
     out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone
     numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.

                             DOORMAN
                 Many young people feel trapped and
                 desperate.

     INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then, the refrigerator's compressor
                 could have clicked on...

     Click.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from
     the Filofax.  Jack catches it.

                             DOORMAN
                 If you don't know what you want, you
                 end up with a lot you don't.

     The Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
                 you why I called him.

     Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It
     RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the
     phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the
                 plane.  We had the same briefcase.
                 I'm... you know, the clever guy.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 I just called a second ago.  There
                 was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick
                 up my phone.  What's up?

                             JACK
                 Well... let me see... here's the
                 thing...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.

                             JACK
                 You buy furniture.  You tell
                 yourself: this is the last sofa I'll
                 ever need.  No matter what else
                 happens, I've got the sofa issue
                 handled.  Then, the right set of
                 dishes.  The right dinette.

                             TYLER
                 This is how we fill up our lives.

     Tyler lights a cigarette.

                             JACK
                 I guess so.

                             TYLER
                 And, now it's gone.

                             JACK
                 All gone.

     Tyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  A woman could cut
                 off your penis while you're asleep
                 and toss it out the window of a
                 moving car.

                             JACK
                 There's always that.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe
                 it's a terrible tragedy.

                             JACK
                 ...no ...no ...

                             TYLER
                 I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,
                 neat little shit.  The trendy paper
                 lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,
                 am I right?

     Jack laughs, nods.  He shakes his head, drinks.

                             TYLER
                 But maybe, just maybe, you've been
                 delivered.

                             JACK
                       (toasts)
                 Delivered from Swedish furniture.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from armchairs in obscure
                 green stripe patterns.

                             JACK
                 Delivered from Martha Stewart.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from bullshit colors like
                 "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."

     They laugh together.  Then, silence.  They drink.

                             JACK
                 Insurance'll cover it.

                             TYLER
                 Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
                 list.

                             JACK
                 What list?

                             TYLER
                 The "now I get to go out and buy the
                 exact same stuff all over again"
                 list.  That list.

                             JACK
                 I don't... think so.

                             TYLER
                 This time maybe get a widescreen TV.
                 You'll be occupied for weeks.

                             JACK
                 Well, I have to file a claim...

                             TYLER
                 The things you own, they end up
                 owning you.

                             JACK
                 Don't I?

                             TYLER
                 Do what you like.

                             JACK
                       (looks at watch)
                 God, it's late.  I should find a
                 hotel...

                             TYLER
                 A hotel?

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

                             TYLER
                 So, you called me up, because you
                 just wanted to have a drink before
                 you... go find a hotel?

                             JACK
                 I don't follow...

                             TYLER
                 We're on our third pitcher of beer.
                 Just ask me.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                 You called me so you could have a
                 place to stay.

                             JACK
                 No, I...

                             TYLER
                 Why don't you cut the shit and ask if
                 you can stay at my place?

                             JACK
                 Would that be a problem?

                             TYLER
                 Is it a problem for you to ask?

                             JACK
                 Can I stay at your place?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, you can.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome.  But, I want you to
                 do me one favor.

                             JACK
                 What's that?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

     Freeze picture.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Let me tell you a little bit about
                 Tyler Durden.

     EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME

     -- And we see it's PORNOGRAPHY.

     INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

     Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,
     Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from
     movies.  Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.

                             JACK
                 Tyler was a night person.  He
                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.
                 A movie doesn't come in one big reel,
                 it's on a few.  In old theaters, two
                 projectors are used, so someone has
                 to change projectors at the exact
                 second when one reel ends and
                 another reel begins.  Sometimes you
                 can see two dots on screen in the
                 upper right hand corner...

     Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS
     briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.

                             TYLER
                 They're called "cigarette burns."

                             JACK
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

                             TYLER
                 Why would anyone want this shitty job?

                             JACK
                 It affords him other interesting
                 opportunities.

                             TYLER
                 -- Like splicing single frames from
                 adult movies into family films.

                             JACK
                 In reel three, right after the
                 courageous dog and the snooty cag --
                 who have celebrity voices -- eat out
                 of a garbage can, there's the flash
                 of Tyler's contribution...

     In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming,
     confused, looking at each other.

     A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling
     vaguely terrible.  Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans
     back in his seat.

     Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.

                             TYLER
                 One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's
                 how long it's up there.

                             JACK
                 No one really knows that they've seen it.
                 But they did.

                             TYLER
                 A nice, big cock.

                             JACK
                 Only a hummingbird could have caught
                 Tyler at work.

     INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

     Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP
     BOWLS.  Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.

                             JACK
                 Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter
                 at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

     The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a
     giant SOUP TUREEN.  His hands are at his open fly and he's
     in position to piss into the soup.

                             JACK
                 He was the guerrilla terrorist of the
                 food service industry.

                             TYLER
                 Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.

     Jack waits.  The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.

                             TYLER
                 ... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 He farted on meringue; he sneezed on
                 braised endive; and, with creme of
                 mushroom soup, well...

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Go ahead.  Say it.

                             JACK
                 You get the idea.

     EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING

     Tyler and Jack come out the back door.

                             JACK
                 I don't know about this.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, either.  I want to find
                 out.  I've never been hit, have you?

                             JACK
                 No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?

                             TYLER
                 I don't want to die without any
                 scars.  How much can you really know
                 about yourself if you've never been
                 in a fight?  Come on... you're the
                 only person I've ever asked.

                             JACK
                 Me?

     Jack stares at him.

                             TYLER
                 Why not you?  I'm letting you go
                 first.  Do it.

                             JACK
                 This is crazy.

                             TYLER
                 Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.

                             JACK
                 Where do you want it?  In the face?

                             TYLER
                 Surprise me.

     Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's
     neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.

                             JACK
                 Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.

                             TYLER
                 Like hell.  That counted.

     Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack
     falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up.

                             TYLER
                 How do you feel?

                             JACK
                 Strange.

                             TYLER
                 But a good strange.

                             JACK
                 Is it?

                             TYLER
                 We've crossed the threshold.  You
                 want to call it off?

                             JACK
                 Call what off?

                             TYLER
                 The fight.

                             JACK
                 What fight?

                             TYLER
                 This fight, pussy.

     Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under
     Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and
     Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier,
     drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.

     EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER

     Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights
     on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-
     induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away.

                             TYLER
                 If you could fight anyone... one on
                 one, whoever you wanted, who would
                 you fight?

                             JACK
                 Anyone?

                             TYLER
                 Anyone.

     Jack thinks.

                             JACK
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

                             TYLER
                 My dad.  No question.

     A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew
                 him, till I was six.  He went and
                 married another woman, had more kids.
                 Every six years or so he'd do it
                 again -- new city, new family.

                             TYLER
                 He was setting up franchises.  My
                 father never went to college, so it
                 was really important that I go.

                             JACK
                 I know that.

                             TYLER
                 After I graduated, I called him long
                 distance and asked, "Now what?"  He
                 said, "Get a job."  When I turned
                 twenty-five, I called him and asked,
                 "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know.
                 Get married."

                             JACK
                 Same here.

                             TYLER
                 A generation of men raised by women.
                 I'm wondering if another woman is the
                 answer we really need.

     Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.

                             JACK
                 We should do this again sometime.

     Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     A street sign: "PAPER STREET."  A PAPER MILL stis on one
     side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the
     land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story,
     long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.

                             JACK
                 Where's your car?

                             TYLER
                 What car?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I don't know how Tyler found the
                 house, but he'd been there for half
                 a year.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It looked like it was waiting to be
                 torn down.  Most of the windows were
                 boarded up.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

     Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 None of the doors locked.  The stairs
                 were ready to collapse.  I didn't
                 know if he owned it or he was
                 squatting.

     Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...

     INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Neither would have surprised me.

     INT. SHOWER - MORNING

     Jack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls.
     Water spits in starts.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing
                 leaked.  Turning on a light meant
                 another light in the house went out.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT.
     FIVE GUYS stand around watching.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee
     with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a
     flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork,
     starts roasting them over a burner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 There were no neighbors.  Just
                 warehouses and the paper mill.  The
                 fart smell of steam, the hamster cage
                 smell of wood chips.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT

     Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --
     THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 At night, Tyler and I were alone for
                 half a mile in every direction.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack
     and Tyler, who FIGHT.  THREE CARS are parked in the lot.

     INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep
     in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a
     certain order, showing Jack how it's done.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When it rained, we had to kill the
                 power.  By the end of the first
                 month, I didn't care about TV.  I
                 didn't mind the warm, stale
                 refrigerator.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     CANDLES BURN.  Tyler and Jack are seated across from each
     other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES.  Rain DRIPS
     from the ceiling.  No furniture.  THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The previous occupant had been a bit
                 of a shut-in.

                             TYLER
                       (of magazine)
                 Hum.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Oh, a new riot control grenade...
                       (reading)
                 "...the successful combination of
                 concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-
                 blasts and simultaneous high-velocity
                 disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."

     Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.

                             JACK
                       ("Reader's Digest")
                 "I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in
                 first person.  "Without me, Joe could
                 not take in oxygen to feed his red
                 blood cells."  There's a whole
                 series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

                             TYLER
                 "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

     Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,
     chooses another magazine.

                             JACK
                 What are you reading?

                             TYLER
                 Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week.
                 New Republic.

                             JACK
                 Show-off.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN
     GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING.  The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY
     than before.  In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I should have been haggling with my
                 insurance company.  I should have
                 been looking for a new condo...

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks along.  He stops, looking at a CHURCH with
     SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking
     coffee and sodas.  Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 .... I should have been upset about
                 my nice, neat, flaming little shit.

     Jack's face shows no reaction.  He continues to walk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But I wasn't.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his
     knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips.  Tyler,
     in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Most of the week, we were Ozzie and
                 Harriet.

     Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday
                 night...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  No one around, but there are at
     least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... we were finding something out: we
                 were finding out, more and more, that
                 we were not alone.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER.
     Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Thursday mornings, all I could do was
                 think about next week.

     Boss gives Jack a dubious look.  Walter's next SLIDE: a
     COMPUTER SCREEN.

                             WALTER
                 The basic premise of cyber-netting
                 your office is -- make things more
                 efficient.

                             BOSS
                 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

                             WALTER
                 Absolutely.

     Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Walter, the Microsoft account exec.
                 Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.
                 Maybe he was thinking about the free-
                 range potluck he'd been to last
                 weekend, or his church-group car-wash
                 fund-raiser.  Or, probably not.

     Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.

                             WALTER
                 I showed this already to my man here.
                 You liked it, didn't you?

     Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They GLOW
     eerily in the dim light.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You can swallow a pint of blood
                 before you get sick.

                             WALTER
                 Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened
                 to the other guy.

     Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Screw Walter.  His candy-ass wouldn't
                 last a second Wednesday night.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all
     directions.  CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed
     lot.  YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against
     the back wall, waiting.  The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:

                             IRVINE
                 Drink up people.  We're closing.

     Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS.  Drunken customers squint and
     get the message.  They plop down money, leaving.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was right in everyone's face.
                 Tyler and I just made it visible.

     Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members
     of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally,
     one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was on the tip of everyone's
                 tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a
                 name.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME

     A BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler
     standing directly beneath it.

                             TYLER
                 Welcome to fight club.

     The guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with
     eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.
     Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every week, Tyler gave the rules that
                 he and I decided.

     PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER
     DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.

                             TYLER
                 The first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.  The
                 second rule of fight club is -- you
                 don't talk about fight club.  The
                 third rule of fight club is -- when
                 someone says "stop" or goes limp, the
                 fight is over.  Fourth rule is --
                 only two guys to a fight.  Fifth
                 rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth
                 rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh
                 rule -- fights go on as long as they
                 have to.  And the eighth and final
                 rule -- if this is your first night
                 at fight club, you have to fight.

     Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN
     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --
                 couldn't remember whether you ordered
                 pens with blue ink or black ink ...

     The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
                 last week when he trounced an actuary
                 twice his size.

     Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies.
     SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of
     Goateed Man, POUNDING him...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes all you could hear were
                 flat, hard packing sounds over the
                 yelling, or the wet choke when
                 someone caught their breath and
                 sprayed...

                             GOATEED MAN
                       (spittle-lipped)
                 Ssssstop... !

     INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY

     Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a
     GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even if I could tell someone they had
                 a good fight, I wouldn't be talking
                 to the same man.

     The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda
     down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Who you were in fight club is not who
                 you were in the rest of the world.

     INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.
     He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an
     apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You weren't alive anywhere like you
                 were there.  But fight club only
                 exists in the hours between when
                 fight club starts and when fight club
                 ends.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from
     his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the
     doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated.

                             BOSS
                 What are you getting yourself into
                 every week?

     Jack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 After fight club, everything else in
                 your life gets the volume turned
                 down.  You can deal with anything.

                             BOSS
                 Have you finished those reports?

                             JACK
                       (handing him reports)
                 Yes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people who had power over you
                 have less and less.

     Jack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with
     his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 By this point, I could wiggle most of
                 the teeth in my jaw.

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A guy came to fight club for the
                 first time, his ass was a wad of
                 cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he
                 was carved out of wood.

                             JACK
                 If you could fight any celebrity?

                             TYLER
                 Alive or dead?

                             JACK
                 Doesn't matter.

                             TYLER
                 Hemingway.  You?

                             JACK
                 Shatner.  William Shatner.

     They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their
     cigarettes, getting on board...

     INT. BUS - DUSK

     The bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,
     Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We all started seeing things
                 differently.  Wherever we went.

     They hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a
     CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt sorry for all the guys packing
                 into gyms, trying to look like what
                 Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said
                 they should.

     Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.

                             TYLER
                 Self-improvement is masturbation.
                 Self-destruction is the answer.

     A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The
     Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the
     man, who stares back.

                             JACK
                       (to Tyler, so the
                        Man can hear)
                 You could take him.

     Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.
     Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.

                             TYLER
                 The trick is not to care.

     Tyler stares forward.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on
     top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The
     surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...

     Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips
     his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler
     turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...

                                                      CUT TO:

     Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --
     brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.
     Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

     Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching
     appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club wasn't about winning or
                 losing.  It wasn't about words.

     The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack
     snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like
     wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 They hysterical shouting was in
                 tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

     Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.
     The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.

                             JACK
                 ... stop...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When the fight was over, nothing was
                 solved, but nothing mattered.

     Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes
     through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their
     attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --
     similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.

                             TYLER
                 Cool.

     Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.

                             OPPONENT
                 How about next week?

                             JACK
                 Look at me.  How about next month?

     Everyone helps Jack walk.  He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Afterwards, we all felt saved.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.

                             TYLER
                 He fell down some stairs.

     The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.

                             JACK
                 I fell down some stairs.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

     Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR.  Tyler's clipping
     at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS.  Jack's
     brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club became the reason to cut
                 your hair short and trim your
                 fingernails.

                             TYLER
                 Any historical figure.

                             JACK
                 Okay... Ghandi.

                             TYLER
                 Good answer.

                             JACK
                 You?

                             TYLER
                 Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys
                 fight till they're burger.

     Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a
     TOOTH.  Jack looks at it.  Tyler puts scissors down, done.

                             TYLER
                 Remember, even the Mona Lisa's
                 falling apart.

     Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

     Jack enters, buttoning his shirt.  The PHONE RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME

     Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone
     cord around her neck.

                             MARLA
                 Where have you been the last few
                 weeks?

                             JACK
                 Marla?

     Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy
     flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone.

                             JACK
                       (quietly)
                 How did you find me?

                             MARLA
                 The forwarding number.  I haven't
                 seen you at any support groups.

                             JACK
                 That's the idea -- we split them.

                             MARLA
                 You haven't been going to yours.

                             JACK
                 I found a new one.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

                             JACK
                 It's for men.

                             MARLA
                 Like testicular cancer?

                             JACK
                 Look, this is a bad time...

                             MARLA
                 I've been going to debtor's
                 anonymous.  You want to see some
                 truly fucked up people?

                             JACK
                 I'm just on my way out...

                             MARLA
                 Me too.  I got a stomach full of
                 Xanax.  I took what was left of a
                 bottle.  Might've been too much.

     Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Picture yourself watching Marla
                 Singer throw herself around her
                 crummy apartment.

                             MARLA
                 This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
                 This is probably one of those cry-for-
                 help things.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This could go on for hours.

                             JACK
                 So you're staying in tonight?

                             MARLA
                 Do you want to wait to hear me
                 describe death?

     Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the
     hook, walks out the back door.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Do you want to listen and see if my
                 spirit can use the telephone?

     Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES,
     LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT.
     Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and
     LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE

     Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING

     Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been
                 living here two months, and Tyler's
                 door was never closed.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest.
     He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.

                             JACK
                 You're not going to believe what I
                 dreamt last night.

     Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's
     been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops.

                             MARLA
                 I can hardly believe anything about
                 last night.

     Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and
     SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing here?

                             MARLA
                 What... ?

                             JACK
                 What the hell are you doing here?

     Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.

                             MARLA
                 Fuck you.

     Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.
     Jack gets up, watches her stomp away.

     Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after
     Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack,
     then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering,
     slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler
     puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.

                             TYLER
                 She's a piece of work.  Get this --
                 I come in here last night, the
                 phone's off the hook...

     Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S
     VOICE FADES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I already knew the story before he
                 told it to me.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (from handset)
                 I'll tell you when I'm floating out
                 of my body.

     Tyler smiles.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler, off all people, think
                 it was a bad thing that Marla Singer
                 was about to die?

     INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars,
     looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the
     stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock,
     Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

     Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged
     eyes look him over.

                             MARLA
                 You got here fast.

     She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along
     with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

                             MARLA
                 The mattresses are all sealed in
                 slippery plastic.

     She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.

                             MARLA
                 Did I call you?

     Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO
     lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you.

     SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors
     opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.

                             MARLA
                 Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops...

     She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.

     INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

     Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE.
     COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits.
     Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.

                             COP
                 8-G!  Where's 8-G?

                             MARLA
                       (pointing)
                 End of the hall.

     The rescuers keep running.

                             MARLA
                       (calling after)
                 The girl who lives there used to be
                 a charming, lovely girl, but she's
                 lost faith in herself...

                             COP
                 Miss Singer, let us help you!  You
                 have every reason to live!

     Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.

                             MARLA
                 She's a monster!  Infectious human
                 waste!  Good luck trying to save her!

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler makes coffee.  Marla slouches against the refrigerator.

                             MARLA
                 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
                 You're gonna have to keep me up all
                 night.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler chuckles, shakes his head.

                             TYLER
                 Unbelievable, huh?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was obviously able to handle it.

     Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.

                             TYLER
                 I mean, this girl... uh, you're not
                 into her or anything... ?

                             JACK
                 No.  Not at all.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.

     Tyler lights his cigarette.

                             TYLER
                 You're sure?

                             JACK
                 Yeah, I'm sure.

                             TYLER
                 Good.  This chick was up on the table
                 with her legs in the stirrups before
                 the doctor even walked in the room.
                 The things that she said... I've
                 never heard a woman talk like that...

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear.

                             MARLA
                       (whispering)
                 I want to have your abortion.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's
     Digest just a little too tight.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler not go for that?
                 Night before last, he was splicing
                 sex organs into "Little Mermaid."

     Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.

                             TYLER
                 You're okay with this?

                             JACK
                 I'm fine.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Put a gun to my head and paint the
                 wall with my brains.

     Tyler smokes.

                             TYLER
                 She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay
                 away from that one.

                             JACK
                 Oh, and my pace is more librarians.

                             TYLER
                 Hey... don't knock librarians.

                             JACK
                 Marla doesn't need a lover.  She
                 needs a case worker.

                             TYLER
                 She needs an exorcist.  This isn't
                 love.  This is sport-fucking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She'd invaded my support groups, now
                 she's invading my home.

                             TYLER
                 Listen... do me a favor... sit here
                 a minute...

     Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts
     down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 You've gotta understand something
                 about me.  I have a little rule,
                 okay?  Don't ever talk to her about
                 me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind
                 of shit.

     Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

                             TYLER
                 If you ever say anything about me or
                 about what happens here in this
                 house, to her or anyone -- I will
                 find out.  And you'll never see me
                 again.  Promise me.

                             JACK
                 Okay.

                             TYLER
                 Promise you won't.

                             JACK
                 Yes, I promise.

                             TYLER
                 Promise?

                             JACK
                 I said I promise!

                             TYLER
                 That was three times you promised.

     Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If only I had wasted a couple of
                 minutes and gone to watch Marla die,
                 none of this would have happened.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds
     of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (muffled through wall)
                 Miserable fucking discharge!

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I could've moved to another room, one
                 on the third floor -- so I wouldn't
                 have heard them.  But I didn't.

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

     Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the
     landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in...

     Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN
     WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

     Jack steps back.

                             JACK
                 I... uh... just going to bed.

     Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.

                             TYLER
                 You want to finish her off?

                             JACK
                 Uh... nah...

     Jack continues toward his room.

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became the calm, little center of
                 the world.  I was the Zen master.

     CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR

     Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.

                              "Worker bees can leave
                               Even drones can fly away
                               The queen is their slave"

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wrote little haiku poems.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits
     in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I faxed them around to everyone.

     He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND.  He presses
     this key over and over.  Boss enters.

                             BOSS
                 Is that your blood?

                             JACK
                 Some of it, yes.

     Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.

                             BOSS
                 Take the rest of the day off.  Come
                 back tomorrow with clean clothes.
                 Get yourself together.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS
     who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I got right in everyone's hostile
                 little face.  Yes, these are bruises
                 from fighting.  I'm comfortable with
                 them.  I am enlightened.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

     Jack walks toward the HOUSE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You give up the condo life, give up
                 all your flaming worldly possessions,
                 go live in a dilapidated house in the
                 toxic waste part of town...

     INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET

     Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA
     from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and you come home to this.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                       (laughing)
                 You fucking slut!!

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Thank you, sir, may I have another!
                 Thank you sir, may I have another... !

     Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in
     the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood
     stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.  Speaking.

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE

     A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 This is Detective Stern with the
                 arson unit.  We have some new
                 information about the "incident" at
                 your condo.

                             JACK
                 Yes?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I don't know if you're aware... your
                 front door -- it seems someone
                 sprayed freon into the lock, then
                 tapped it with a chisel to shatter
                 the cylinder.

                             JACK
                 No, I wasn't aware...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Does this sound strange to you?

                             JACK
                 Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.

     Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 The dynamite...

                             JACK
                 Dynamite?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium
                 oxalate and potassium perchloride.
                 Do you know what that means?

                             JACK
                 What does that mean?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 It means it was homemade.

                             JACK
                 This is... really a shock...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Whoever set this homemade dynamite
                 could've blown out the pilot light
                 days before the explosion.  The gas,
                 it seems, was just a detonator.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think could've done this?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I'll ask the questions, son.

                             TYLER
                       (whispering in Jack's ear)
                 Tell him...

     Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler
     standing right next to him.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                       (overlap w/below)
                 "The liberator who destroyed my
                 property has re-aligned my paradigm
                 of perception."

                             JACK
                 Shhhhhh!
                       (into phone,
                        overlap w/above)
                 I don't know what to make of this,
                 sir, I really don't...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Do you know anyone who'd have the
                 expertise or motive to do something
                 like this?

                             TYLER
                 "I reject the basic assumptions of
                 civilization, including material
                 possession."

     Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo.
                 I loved every stick of furniture.
                 The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were
                 me.  The dishes were me.  The plants
                 were...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd like to thank the academy...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Well, if any ideas come to you, give
                 me a call.  In the meantime, don't
                 leave town.  I may need to bring you
                 in for questioning.

     END INTERCUT

     Jack hangs up.  Tyler shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  You could be cursed
                 with the three terrible Karmas.  You
                 could be beautiful, rich and famous.

     Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's
     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...

     Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing
     water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla
     lights a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Except for their humping, Tyler and
                 Marla were never in the same room.

                             MARLA
                 I got this dress at a thrift store
                 for one dollar.

                             JACK
                       (keeps scrubbing)
                 Worth every penny.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 My parents pulled this exact act for
                 years -- one came in, the other
                 disappeared.

     Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to
     Jack.  She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close
     to Jack's body, almost touhcing.

                             MARLA
                       (seductive)
                 It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone
                 loved it intensely for one day, then
                 tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --
                 so special, then, bam -- it's
                 abandoned on the side of the road,
                 tinsel still clinging to it...

     Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses
     against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up.

                             MARLA
                 Like sex crime victims, underwear
                 inside-out, bound with electrical
                 tape.

                             JACK
                       (coldly)
                 It suits you.

     She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:

                             MARLA
                 You can borrow it sometime.

     Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke
     in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the
     sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Get rid of her.

     Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.

                             JACK
                 You get rid of her.

                             TYLER
                       (pointing at Jack)
                 Don't mention me.

     Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the
     archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes
     and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something
     on the junk strewn table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm six years old again, passing
                 messages between my parents.

                             JACK
                 I, uh... think you should go now.

     Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,
     pushing other things off to the floor.

                             JACK
                 It's time for you to leave.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry, I'm leaving.

     Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She
     moves up into Jack's face.

                             MARLA
                 You're such a nutcase, I can't even
                 begin to keep up.

                             JACK
                 Goodbye.

     She laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door,
     she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls."
     Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Nice work.

     Jack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window,
     Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant
     of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 To make soap, first we have to render
                 fat.

     Jack looks at Tyler.

     CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."

     EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT

     Tyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence,
     struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over,
     snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps.

     FOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a
     DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD
     moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away.

     MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler
     eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.

                             TYLER
                 The best fat for making soap --
                 because the salt balance is just
                 right -- comes form human bodies...

     Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.

                             JACK
                 What is this place?

                             TYLER
                 A liposuction clinic.

     From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,
     thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.

                             TYLER
                 Paydirt.  From society's richest
                 asses and thighs.

     TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying
     BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down
     the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs.
     Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.

                             TYLER
                 As the fat renders, the tallow floats
                 to the surface.  Remember the crap
                 they taught you in Boy Scouts.

                             JACK
                 Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.

                             TYLER
                 This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll
                 mix it back in when we make the soap.

     Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the
     glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it.

                             TYLER
                 Lye -- the crucial ingredient.
                       (adding lye to mix)
                 Ancient peoples found their clothes
                 got cleaner if they washed them at a
                 certain spot in the river.  Why?
                 Because, human sacrifices were once
                 made on the hills above this river.
                 Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain
                 feel.  Water seeped through the wood
                 ashes to become lye.  The lye
                 combined with the melted fat of the
                 bodies, till a thick white soapy
                 discharge crept into the river.

     Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes
     Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.

                             TYLER
                 The first soap was made from the
                 ashes of heroes.  Like the first
                 monkeys shot into space.

     The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a
     bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.

                             TYLER
                 Without sacrifice, without death, we
                 would have nothing.

     Jack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand
     and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.

                             TYLER
                 This is a chemical burn.  It will
                 hurt more than you've ever been
                 burned and you will have a scar.

     Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of
     Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the
                 back of my hand.

                             TYLER
                 Look at your hand.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Guided meditation worked for cancer,
                 it could work for this.

     Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.

                             TYLER
                 Come back to the pain.  Don't shut
                 this out.

     Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler
     keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I tried not to think of the words
                 "searing" or "flesh."  I imagined my
                 pain as a ball of healing white light.

     SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...

                             TYLER
                 Stop it.  This is your pain -- your
                 burning hand.  It's right here.  Look
                 at it.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I was going to my cave to find my
                 power animal.

     SHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand again.  Jack re-focuses on Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 Don't deal with this the way those
                 dead people do.  Deal with it the way
                 a living person does.

     SHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A
     FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US.  RESUME:

     Jack tries to pull his hand free.  Tyler won't let go.
     Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain:

                             JACK
                 I... I think I understand.  I think
                 I get it...

                             TYLER
                 No, what you're feeling is premature
                 enlightenment.

     SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...

                             TYLER
                 This is the greatest moment of your
                 life and you're off somewhere,
                 missing it.

                             JACK
                 No, I'm not...

     SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

                             TYLER
                 Shut up.  Our fathers were our models
                 for God.  And, if our fathers bailed,
                 what does that tell us about God?

                             JACK
                 I don't know...

     SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face again...

                             TYLER
                 Listen to me.  You have to consider
                 the possibility that God doesn't like
                 you, he never wanted you.  In all
                 probability, He hates you.  This is
                 not the worst thing that can happen...

                             JACK
                 It isn't... ?

                             TYLER
                 We don't need him...

                             JACK
                 We don't... ?

     SHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP
     OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER
     MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME:

     Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...

                             JACK
                 ... Marla ... ?

                             TYLER
                 Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We
                 are God's unwanted children, with no
                 special place and no special
                 attention, and so be it.

     Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best
     to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled
     knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.

                             TYLER
                 You can go to the sink and run water
                 over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you
                 can use vinegar to neutralize the
                 burn, but first you have to give up.
                 First, you have to know that someday,
                 you are going to die.  Until you know
                 that, you will be useless.

     Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...

                             JACK
                 You ... you don't know what this
                 feels like, Tyler.

     Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.
     Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle
     of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.

     Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

                             TYLER
                 Congratulations.  You're a step
                 closer to hitting bottom.

     INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-
     over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms.

     There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on
     the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get
     arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler sold the soap to department
                 stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God
                 knows what they charged.  How ironic.
                 We were selling rich women their own
                 fat asses back to them.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,
     smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must
                 be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie
                 to work anymore.

     Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 "The first rule of fight club is you
                 don't talk about fight club."

     Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I must've left the original in the
                 copy machine.

                             BOSS
                 "The second rule of fight club...
                 Is this yours?

                             JACK
                 Hmm?

                             BOSS
                 You don't get paid to abuse the copy
                 machine.

                             JACK
                 "Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an
                 image.

                             BOSS
                 Pretend you're me.  You find this.
                 What would you do?

     Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.

                             JACK
                 Me? I'd be very careful who I talked
                 to about this.  It sounds like
                 someone dangerous wrote it... someone
                 who might snap at any moment,
                 stalking from office to office with
                 an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas
                 semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round
                 after round into colleagues and co-
                 workers.

     Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts
     tearing it into pieces.

                             JACK
                 Might be someone you've known for
                 years... somebody very close to you.
                 Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing
                 me every little piece of trash you
                 pick up.

     Jack puts the PAPER in his trash.  Bass stares with a tinge
     of outrage, a tinge of fear.  PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it.

                             JACK
                 Compliance and Liability.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 My tit's going to rot off.

                             JACK
                 Just a second.
                       (to Boss; smiles)
                 Could you excuse me?  I need to take
                 this call.

     Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 What are you talking about?

     INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...

                             MARLA
                 Would you do something for me?  I
                 need you to check and see if there's
                 a lump in my breast.  I can't afford
                 to throw money away on a doctor.

                             JACK
                 I don't know ...

                             MARLA
                 Please.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral
                 in her book.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES
     from a VAN with the sign "MEALS ON WHEELS."

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla leads Jack inside.

                             JACK
                 This is a sweet side of you.  Picking
                 these up for ...
                       (reads the boxes:)
                 "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines."
                 Where are they?

                             MARLA
                 Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive
                 and I'm in poverty.  You want any?

                             JACK
                 No, thanks.

                             MARLA
                 Good.

     He stares at her while she eats.

                             MARLA
                 What happened to your hand?

     Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open.  Jack
     stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her
     breast.  Marla's hand guides his.

                             JACK
                 Where?  Here?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 There?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 Here.

                             MARLA
                 Feel anything?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Jack's head is behind Marla's.  They speak softer, slower.

                             MARLA
                 Make sure.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

                             MARLA
                 You feel nothing?

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.

                             MARLA
                 Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.

                             JACK
                 No... no problem.

                             MARLA
                 I wish I could return the favor.

     Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.

                             JACK
                 I think everything's okay here.

                             MARLA
                 I could check your prostate.

                             JACK
                 Uh ... nah.

                             MARLA
                       (pause)
                 Well... thanks, anyway.

     Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than
     just friendly.  Jack pulls away.

                             JACK
                 So.... are we done?

     Marla sighs.

                             MARLA
                 Yeah, we're done.  See you around.

     EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window,
     watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big
     BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.

                             BOB
                 Cornelius!  How are you?

                             JACK
                 Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?

                             BOB
                 Better than I've ever been in my life.

                             JACK
                 Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men
                 Together?"

     An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.

                             BOB
                 No.  I found something new.

                             JACK
                 Really, what's that?

                             BOB
                       (quietly)
                 The first rule is... you aren't
                 supposed to talk about it...

                             JACK
                 Oh.

                             BOB
                 And the second rule about it is...
                 you're not supposed to talk about it.
                 And the third rule...

                             JACK
                 Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

                                  BOB
                 You are?!

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.

     Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.

                             BOB
                 That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking
                 great! Congratulations.

                             JACK
                 Yeah, both of us.

                             BOB
                 You know about the guy who invented
                 it? I hear all kinds of things.
                 Supposedly, he was born in a mental
                 institution.  They say he only sleeps
                 one hour a night.  You know about
                 this guy?  Tyler Durden?

     INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the
     circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee.

     EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER

     Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none
     of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob
     Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin
     with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack.

                             BOB
                 Thank you.  Thank you.

     Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a
     sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.

                             JACK
                 You're welcome.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club -- this was mine and
                 Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.

     INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK.
     Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack
     takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack...

                             TYLER
                 No thanks, I quit.

                             JACK
                 You quit?

                             TYLER
                 Yeah.  Where you headed?

                             JACK
                 Work.  Going to work.

     Tyler scratches his chin absently.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Nothing.  Do what you like.

     Tyler walks out the way he came.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER.

     INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe.
     Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             BOSS
                 Okay.  Where to begin?  With your
                 constant absenteeism?  With your
                 unpresentable appearance?  You're up
                 for review...

                             JACK
                 I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.

     Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

                             JACK
                 Let's pretend.  You're the Department
                 of Transportation, and you discover
                 that our company intentionally did
                 nothing about leather seats cured in
                 third world countries with chemicals
                 we know cause birth defects?  Brake
                 linings that fail after a thousand
                 miles.  Fuel injectors that burn
                 people alive.

                             BOSS
                 Just who the fuck do you think you
                 are?!  Get out!  You're fired!

                             JACK
                 What about this?  Keep me on payroll
                 as an outside consultant.  In
                 exchange for my salary, I'll keep my
                 mouth shut.  I won't need to come to
                 the office.  I can do this job from
                 home.

     Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

                             BOSS
                 You little fucker!  I oughta...

     Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle.
     He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by
     the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and
     SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.

     Jack gets back to his feet.

                             JACK
                 Please... don't hit me again, please.
                 I'm your responsibility...

     He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.
     He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents
     flying.  He hits the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For some reason, I thought of my
                 first fight -- with Tyler.

     Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.

                             JACK
                 Please... give me the paychecks like
                 I asked for.  I won't be any trouble.
                 You won't see me again.

     Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off.
     Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything this man took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting
     himself up.  He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, SMUDGES
     blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.

                             JACK
                 Please... please...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And right then, at our most excellent
                 moment together...

     Two SECURITY GUARDS enter and gape at the sight.  Behind
     them stand CURIOUS WORKERS, looking in.

                             JACK
                       (gurgling blood)
                 Please don't hit me again.

     INT. TYLER'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - DAY

     Jack holds a CHECK in front of Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Six months advance pay.  Six months!

                             TYLER
                 Fucking sweet.

                             JACK
                 Okay, and... and...

     Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.

                             JACK
                 Forty-eight airline flight coupons.
                 Plus... hold on... just a minute...

     Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door.  He
     drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with
     his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.

                             JACK
                 I am now officially self-employed.

     Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.

                             TYLER
                 Good for you.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     LOUD.  An enormous CROWD of guys, including Jack and Bob,
     stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle,
     holding up his hands to quiet them...

                             TYLER
                 I look around... I look around and
                 see a lot of new faces.

     An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 Shut up!  Which means a lot of you
                 have been breaking the first two
                 rules of fight club.

     A glum silence falls.  Guys look at each other.

                             TYLER
                 I see in fight club the strongest and
                 smartest men who have ever lived --
                 an entire generation pumping gas and
                 waiting tables; or they're slaves
                 with white collars.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 Advertisements have them chasing cars
                 and clothes, working jobs they hate
                 so they can buy shit they don't need.
                 We are the middle children of
                 history, with no purpose or place.
                 We have no great war, or great
                 depression.  The great war is a
                 spiritual war.  The great depression
                 is our lives.  We were raised by
                 television to believe that we'd be
                 millionaires and movie gods and rock
                 stars -- but we won't.  And we're
                 learning that fact.  And we're very,
                 very pissed-off.

     The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement.  Jack
     looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 We are the quiet young men who listen
                 until it's time to decide.

     A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into
     the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.

                             TYLER
                 Who are you?

                             FAT MAN (LOU)
                 Who am I?!  There's a sign on the
                 front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm
                 fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.

                             LOU
                 Who told you motherfuckers you could
                 use my place?

                             TYLER
                 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

                             LOU
                 Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a
                 broken collarbone.

     Everyone glances guiltily at each other.

                             LOU
                 He don't own this place, I do.  How
                 much money's he getting for this?

                             TYLER
                 There is no money.

                             LOU
                 Really?

                             TYLER
                 It's free to all.

                             LOU
                 Ain't that something?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, it is.

                             LOU
                 Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone
                 outta here now!

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome to join our club.

                             LOU
                 Did you hear what I just said?!

                             TYLER
                 You and your friend.

     Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             LOU
                 You hear me now?

     Tyler gains his breath, determined.  He looks up, turns his
     head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.

     Tyler straightens, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

     Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move
     forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward
     anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.

     More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 We really need to use this place.

     Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his
     face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou
     starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.

                             TYLER
                 That's it.... that's good.  Get it
                 all out.  You'll feel better.

     Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,
     sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who
     is just as bewildered.

     Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...

                             TYLER
                 Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
                 this whole fucking world...

     Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler
     off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler
     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou
     slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler
     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...

                             TYLER
                 You don't know where I've been.

     Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his
     bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler
     clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...

                             TYLER
                 We need this place.  We need it.
                 Please let us keep it, please...

     Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.

                             LOU
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 Pleeeeeease!

                             LOU
                 Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the
                 basement!  Get off me!

                             TYLER
                 We need some towels, Lou.  We need
                 replacement light bulbs.

                             LOU
                 Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!

                             TYLER
                 Thank you.  Thank you, sir...

                             LOU
                 Let go of me!!

     Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug
     drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to
     his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He
     and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.

     Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to
     a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his
     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs
     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.

                             TYLER
                 This week, each of you has a homework
                 assignment.  You're going to go out
                 and start a fight with a total
                 stranger...
                       (pause, drooling blood)
                 You're going to start a fight... and
                 you're going to lose.

     Jack beams in appreciation.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll
                 do just about anything to avoid a
                 fight.

     The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him...

                             YUPPIE
                 Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what
                 are you doing?!  Who are you?!!

     The Yuppie backs away.  Ricky follows...

                             YUPPIE
                 Get away from me!  Keep away!
                 NO... !

     Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie.  The Yuppie struggles spastically.

                             YUPPIE
                 Who are you!?  Why are you attacking
                 me... ?!

     Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.

     EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

     A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the
     sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.

                             FIRST MAN
                 Hey... hey...

                             SECOND MAN
                 Watch out, jackass!

     These men continue on their way.

     The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who
     looks down, stunned.

                             SEMINARIAN
                 You... you did that on purpose!

     The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs
     the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic
     shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.
     The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to
     run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the
     Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight.

     INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

     A FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a
     neck and squeezes, blood and sweat dripping.  It's the
     YUPPIE and the SEMINARIAN fighting.  Tyler walks around the
     perimeter of the circle.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Now nobody was the center of fight
                 club except the two men fighting.
                 The leader walked around in the
                 crowd, out in the darkness.

     Tyler hands ENVELOPES out to the crowd.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everyone took a homework assignment.

     EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

     Ricky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which
     reads: "DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO
     FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! -- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY."

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS use a MARKER, writing on a FILE: "Disinformation."

     EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work
     together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from
     the ground.  They reverse it, then replace it.

     MOMENTS LATER

     Jack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD.

                             JACK
                 There's fight club in Delaware City.

                             TYLER
                 I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

     As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against
     front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...

                             JACK
                 Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.
                 And, Bob said he was at fight club in
                 Newcastle last week.

                             TYLER
                 Newcastle?  Did you start that one?

                             JACK
                 I thought you did.

     In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot --
     front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.

     INT. FAMILY HOUSEHOLD -- NIGHT

     FATHER, MOTHER, YOUNG DAUGHTER and SON, eat dinner, watching
     TELEVISION.  Suddenly, the TV IMAGE turns to SNOW and static.

     Family members stop eating.  Father picks up the REMOTE,
     points it -- all channels are SNOW.

     Father turns the TV OFF.  He and his family members look at
     each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable.

     EXT. CITY ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

     The Yuppie SWINGS a BASEBALL BAT -- DESTROYS a digital
     SATELLITE DISH.  The Yuppie and the Seminarian move on,
     climbing to a neighboring rooftop.  They come upon another
     DISH.  The Seminarian takes the bat, takes a SWING...

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS place NEWS CLIPPINGS into a FILE: "Mischief."

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - ON GROUND - DAY

     Two AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE,MEN, with bruised faces, rip open
     a box from a PRINT SHOP.  They dig up AIRPLANE SAFETY
     INSTRUCTION CARDS and begin inserting them into each
     seatback.  We SEE a CARD - it shows passengers SCREAMING
     and FLAILING ABOUT IN TERROR.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     Huge office.  Rows and rows of desks.  FIGHT CLUB MEMBERS
     work: one guy moving from COMPUTER MONITOR to COMPUTER
     MONITOR, using a DRILL to drill a hole into the top of each.

     Other guys follow behind, with FUNNELS and CANS of GASOLINE,
     filling each monitor with gasoline.

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     Files and newspaper clippings are piled up.  HANDS write on
     a new FILE FOLDER: "Arson."

     EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

     The Yuppie crumbles a loaf of stale bread into a bucket,
     stirring it with a big spoon, mixing in a BOTTLE of EX-LAX.

     Nearby, Rob throws handfuls of wet BREADCRUMBS to PIGEONS...
     HUNDREDS of PIGEONS -- a rooftop feeding-frenzy.

     EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack cross the parking lot, towards the
     convenience store.  Jack wears a BACKPACK.

                             TYLER
                 Let me have that a minute...

     Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.

                             JACK
                 What are we doing?

                             TYLER
                 Homework assignment.

                             JACK
                 What is it?

     Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.

                             TYLER
                 Human Sacrifice.

     Jack turns white, staring at the gun.

     EXT. BEHIND THE CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

     The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out
     at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.  Jack follows,
     freaked.  Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

                             CLERK
                 Please... don't...

                             TYLER
                 Give me your wallet.

     The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler
     snatches it.  Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.

                             TYLER
                 Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,
                 apartment A.  A small, cramped
                 basement apartment.

                             RAYMOND
                 How'd you know?

                             TYLER
                 They give basement apartments letters
                 instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're
                 going to die.

     Tyler rummages through the wallet.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

                             RAYMOND
                 Yesssss...

                             TYLER
                 Your mom and dad will have to call
                 kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up
                 your dental records, because there
                 won't be much left of your face.

                             RAYMOND
                 Please, God, no...

     Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 An expired community college student
                 ID card.  What did you used to study,
                 Raymond K. Hessel?

                             RAYMOND
                 S-S-Stuff.

                             TYLER
                 "Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?

     Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.

                             TYLER
                 I asked you what you studied.

                             JACK
                 Tell him!

                             RAYMOND
                 Biology, mostly.

                             TYLER
                 Why?

                             RAYMOND
                 I... I don't know...

                             TYLER
                 What did you want to be, Raymond K.
                 Hessel?

     Raymond weeps and says nothing.  Tyler COCKS the gun.
     Raymond GASPS.

                             TYLER
                 The question, Raymond, was "what did
                 you want to be?"

     A beat.

                             JACK
                 Answer him!

                             RAYMOND
                 A veterinarian!

                             TYLER
                 Animals.

                             RAYMOND
                 Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

                             TYLER
                 Stuff.  That means you have to get
                 more schooling.

                             RAYMOND
                 Too much school.

     Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.

                             TYLER
                 Would you rather be dead?

                             RAYMOND
                 No, please, no, God, no!

     Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.

                             RAYMOND
                 NOOOOO!

     Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.

                             TYLER
                 I'm keeping your license.  I know
                 where you live.  I'm going to check
                 on you.  If you aren't back in school
                 and on your way to being a
                 veterinarian in six weeks, you will
                 be dead.  Get the hell out of here.

     Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack
     and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.

                             JACK
                   I feel sick.

                             TYLER
                   Imagine how he feels.

     Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --
     CLICK.  Empty.

                             JACK
                 I don't care, that was horrible.

     Tyler walks away.

                             TYLER
                 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful
                 day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.

     Jack watches Tyler go.

                             TYLER
                 His breakfast will taste better than
                 any meal he has ever eaten.

     Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.  He finally
     turns back, following after Tyler.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled
     COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... !

     EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING

     Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN

     VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it
     across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his
     shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work...

                             TYLER
                       (muttering quietly)
                 ... You are not how much money you
                 have in the bank.  You are not the
                 shoes you wear.

     Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of
     the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...

                             TYLER
                 You are not the contents of your
                 wallet...

     INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

     The DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for
     Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't
                 see it till it hit you between the
                 eyes.
                       (pause)
                 But, it started to make sense... in
                 a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No
                 distractions.  The ability to let
                 that which does not matter truly
                 slide.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     Jack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it
     dropped Jack off right in front of the house.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with
     PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator.

                             JACK
                 Hey.

                             TYLER
                 Hey.

     Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler
     comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.

                             TYLER
                 Go on in.  We're celebrating.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT
     follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in
     front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed
     in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.

                             RICKY
                 You are not your job.

                             OTHERS TOGETHER
                 You are not your job.

                             RICKY
                 You are not how much money you have
                 in the bank.

                             BOB
                 Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...

     Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with
     an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.

                             ANGEL FACE
                       (to Jack)
                 Great, thanks.

     Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.

                             BOB
                 Shhhhh!  Watch!

     Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER
     MORRIS BUILDING."  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE
     PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames
     pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.

                             REPORTER (V.O.)
                 Police Commissioner Jacobs has just
                 arrived... just a second... excuse
                 me, Commissioner, could you tell us
                 what you think has happened?

     COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.

                             COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)
                 We believe this is related to the
                 recent acts of vandalism around the
                 city.  It's some kind of organized
                 group, and we are coordinating a
                 rigorous investigation.

     Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler
     tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.

                             JACK
                 What did you guys do?

     They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake
     their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys'
     faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid.

                             BOB
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem
                 is... you do not ask questions.

     Jack stares at them.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.
     He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S
     UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...
     RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Jacobs saunters down an empty hall.  He stops to check his
     tie in a mirror.  He pushes open the door of the MEN'S
     BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the
     bathroom.  He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth.  The
     OTHER "WAITERS" rush in.  Jack stays back to keep the door
     shut.  Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his
     pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.

                             TYLER
                 Wrap it around the top of his hackie-
                 sack.

                             BOB
                 Man, his balls are ice cold.

     Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.
     Jacobs is bug-eyed.  Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.

                             TYLER
                 You're not going to continue your
                 "rigorous investigation."  You will
                 publicly state that there is no
                 underground group.  Or -- imagine,
                 the rest of your life with your
                 scrotum flapping empty.

                             JACOBS
                       (mouth taped)
                 ... no... please, no...

                             TYLER
                 We'll send one to the New York Times
                 and one to the Los Angeles Times.
                 Press release style.  Your nuts will
                 be bicoastal.  Understood?  The
                 people you're after are everyone you
                 depend on.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 We do your laundry, cook your food
                 and serve you dinner.  We guard you
                 while you sleep.  We drive your
                 ambulances.  Do not fuck with us.

     Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to
     JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.

     EXT. HOTEL - LATER

     Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE
     ENTRANCE.  Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.
     Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.

     Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Fight club in full swing.  Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING
     the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt like putting a bullet between
                 the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't
                 screw to save its species.

     The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an
     inscrutable stone face.

     Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard.  Blood
     flies.  The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wanted to open the dump valves on
                 oil tankers and smother all the
                 French beaches I'd never see.

     Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious.  Jack stops,
     stares down, numb.  Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to
     let him pass.  Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

                             JACK
                 I felt like destroying something
                 beautiful.

     EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER

     RAINING.  Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.
     A idling car HONKS.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.  A bruised-
     faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.

                             VALET
                 There you are, Mr. Durden.  Airport
                 parking, long term.

                             JACK
                       (motions to car)
                 After you, Mr. Durden...

                             TYLER
                 No... after you.

     INT. STOLEN CAR

     Tyler gets in the driver's seat.  Jack gets into the front
     passenger seat.  Ricky and the mechanic are in back.

     EXT. STREET

     Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb.  It has two
     bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."

     INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER

     RAIN GUSHES down.  Jack stews, silent.  The car moves down
     a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.

                             TYLER
                 Something on your mind?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I told about "Project
                 Mayhem?"

                             TYLER
                 What should I have told you?

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I involved from the
                 beginning?  You and I started fight
                 club together.

                             TYLER
                 Fight club was the beginning.  Now
                 it's out of the basements and there's a
                 name for it -- Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem is
                 you do not ask questions.

                             JACK
                 This is as much mine as yours.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it
                 about you and me?

                             JACK
                 You know what I mean.

                             TYLER
                 What do you want?  A statement of
                 purpose... ?

                             JACK
                 Look...

                             TYLER
                 Should I E-mail you?  Should I put
                 this on your "action item list?"

                             JACK
                 I want to know --

                             TYLER
                 What do you want to know about
                 Project Mayhem?

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem --

                             JACK
                       (to Ricky and Mechanic)
                 Shut up!!
                       (to Tyler)
                 I want to know what's going on.

     Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...
     Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...

                             TYLER
                 This does not belong to us.  We are
                 not the leaders.  We are not special.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world.  We are all part
                 of the same compost heap...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     Tyler steers back into the proper lane.  The other CAR flies
     past, HORN SOUNDING...

                             JACK
                 What the hell ... ?!

                             TYLER
                 You choose your level of involvement.
                 I won't make decisions for you.

                             JACK
                 I'm not asking you to.

                             TYLER
                 You're asking questions that don't
                 have answers.  You know just as much
                 about Project Mayhem as anybody else.

                             JACK
                 I don't think that's true.

     Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.
     Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.

                             JACK
                 Tyler... what is this... !

     Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.

                             TYLER
                 What will you wish you'd done before
                 you died?

                             RICKY
                 Paint a self-portrait.

                             MECHANIC
                 Build a house.

                             TYLER
                       (to Jack)
                 And you?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Nothing!

                             TYLER
                 If you died right now, how would you
                 feel about your life?

                             JACK
                 I would feel nothing about my life?
                 Is that what you want to hear?!

     The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves
     to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.

                             TYLER
                 I want to hear the truth.

                             JACK
                 Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck
                 you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of
                 this.  How's that?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you think I blew up your condo?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend
                 retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You
                 have to forget everything you know,
                 everything you think you know --
                 about life, about friendship, about
                 you and me.

     Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his
     hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the
     wheel... the car swerves...

     The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.

     Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at
     Tyler with dead eyes.

                             JACK
                 Okay, okay... fine...

     Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.
     Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to
     take the wheel.

     THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of
     the road, surrounded by flares.

     Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the
     shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are
     illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles.

     They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The
     back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-
     over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd never been in a car accident.
                 This must've been what all those
                 statistics felt like before I filed
                 them into my reports.

     The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.

     EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

     Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around...
     opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the
     mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear
     window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.

                             TYLER
                 We just had a near-life experience.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the
     ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair.

                             TYLER
                 In the world I see -- you're stalking
                 elk through the damp canyon forests
                 around the ruins of Rockefeller
                 Center.  You will wear leather
                 clothes that last you the rest of
                 your life.  You will climb the wrist-
                 thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears
                 Tower.  You will see tiny figures
                 pounding corn and laying-strips of
                 venison on the empty car pool lane of
                 the ruins of a superhighway.

     Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.

                             TYLER
                       (leaving)
                 Feel better, champ.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed,
     seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and
     HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.

     Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the
     counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours
     ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:

                             MARLA
                 I'll be out of your way in a sec.

     She seems to be as weak as Jack.

                             JACK
                 You... don't have to... leave.

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.

                             JACK
                 Really... I mean it.
                       (pause)
                 Have you been going to your groups?

                             MARLA
                 Chloe's dead.

                             JACK
                 When?

                             MARLA
                 Do you care?

                             JACK
                 I don't know.

                             MARLA
                 It was the smart move on her part.

     Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.
     There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer.

                             JACK
                 Why are we both... caught up like
                 this... with... ?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I came so close to saying Tyler's
                 name, I could feel it vibrate inside
                 my mouth.

     Marla looks a him, waiting.

                             JACK
                 I don't understand.  Why does a weak
                 person have to go out and find a
                 strong person... to hang onto?

                             MARLA
                 What do you get out of it?

     Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite
     figure where it's coming from.

                             JACK
                 You hear that?

                             MARLA
                 Hear what?

                             JACK
                 That... sawing and hammering.

                             MARLA
                 Have we been talking too long?  Must
                 we change the subject?

     Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,
     Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.

                             TYLER
                       (harsh whisper)
                 You're not talking about me, are you?

     Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 No.

                             MARLA
                 That day you came over to my place to
                 play doctor... what was going on
                 there?

                             TYLER
                       (still a whisper)
                 What are you talking about?

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 Nothing.

                             MARLA
                 Nothing?  I don't think so.

                             TYLER
                       (whisper)
                 This conversation...

                             JACK
                 This conversation...

                             TYLER
                 ... is over.

                             JACK
                 ... is over.

     Marla comes to touch Jack's hair.  Jack closes the basement
     door.  Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his
     hand.  Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.

                             MARLA
                 What is this?  Who did this?

                             JACK
                 ... A person.

                             MARLA
                 Guy or girl?

                             JACK
                 Why would you ask if it's a guy or a
                 girl?!

                             MARLA
                 Why would you get bent if I asked?

                             JACK
                 Let go of me...
                       (pulls his hand free)
                 Leave me alone.

                             MARLA
                 You're afraid to say.

     Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with
     frustration.  She leaves out the back door, not looking back.

     Jack leans against the wall.  After a moment, he opens the
     basement door, heads downstairs...

     INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE

     Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...

     INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks around.  TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the
     basement, as many as can fit into the space.

                             JACK
                       (calling upstairs)
                 Tyler... ?  What's this for?

     From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring
     ahead in subordinate military style.  He's in black pants,
     black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army
     surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.

                             JACK
                 Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?

     Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.

                             TYLER
                 You're too young.  Sorry.

                             JACK
                 Wait a minute...

     Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.

                             JACK
                 "Too young?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant is young, we tell
                 him he's too young.  Old, too old.
                 Fat, too fat.

                             JACK
                 "Applicant?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant waits at the door
                 for three days without food, shelter
                 or encouragement, then he can enter
                 and begin training.

                             JACK
                 "Training?"  Tyler...

     EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,
     unsure.  Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.

                             JACK
                 Uh, look.  You're too... young to...
                 train here.  You should probably be
                 on you way.

     No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.  Jack goes
     back inside.  Tyler closes the door.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky remains at attention.  Jack bursts out with a BROOM,
     knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.

                             JACK
                 Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!
                 You will never get inside this house!

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's still there.  Tyler comes out, friendly.

                             TYLER
                 Look, friend, I'm sorry for the
                 misunderstanding.  It's not the end
                 of the world.  Just go away.  You're
                 trespassing and I will call the
                 police.  Nothing personal.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky, same spot.  Jack bursts outside with the broom again.

                             JACK
                 You're never getting through this
                 door, you stupid little weasel!  Look
                 at me when I talk to you... !

     He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.

                             JACK
                 What is your major malfunction!?

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the
     PORCH below.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sooner or later, we all became what
                 Tyler wanted us to be.

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a
     paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out.
     Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the
     following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --

                             TYLER
                 You have two black shirts?  Two pair
                 black trousers?  One pair black
                 boots?  Two pair black socks?  One
                 black coat?  Three hundred dollars
                 personal burial money?  Go inside.

     Ricky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob.

                             TYLER
                 You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're
                 too fat.  Nice seeing you.

     Bob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and
     starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack
     follows Bob...

                             JACK
                 Bob... Bob, wait...
                       (leading Bob back)
                 Let me explain this to you...

     EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT

     CRICKETS CHIRP.  Bob stands at at rigid attention.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky
     finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR.  Tyler comes to give the
     top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP.

                             TYLER
                 A monkey, ready to be shot into
                 space.  A Space Monkey, ready to
                 sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.

     From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."

     EXT. PORCH - DAY

     Jack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's
     another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes
     out the front door with the BROOM...

                             RICKY
                       (to Bob)
                 You're too fucking old, fatty!  We
                 don't want your kind here!
                       (to short guy)
                 You're too short.  Go away, stumpy!
                 Go back to the circus!

     Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 So it went...

     EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

     Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the
     square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working
     with shovels, rakes, etc.  They cart away WHEELBARROWS of
     rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler built his army.

     IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 To what purpose, might one ask?
                 Well, one might ask, if not for the
                 first rule of Project Mayhem.

     Jack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS
     work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one
     SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In Tyler We Trust.

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY

     Jack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, then...

     INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY

     Jack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     The room is empty.  Jack stares.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was gone.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.

     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They
     pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off
     to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the
     wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's
     LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "You are not a beautiful and unique
                 snowflake.  You are the same decaying
                 organic matter as everything else.
                 We are all part of the same compost
                 heap."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Planet Tyler.

     Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world."

     Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had to hug the walls, trapped
                 inside this clockwork of Space
                 Monkeys, cooking and working and
                 sleeping in teams.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The house became a living thing, wet
                 inside from so many people sweating
                 and breathing.  So many people
                 moving, the house moved.

     Jack walks out.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Jack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.
     Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are
     lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under
     SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson."

     Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through
     a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 That wouldn't interest you.

                             JACK
                 Where's Tyler?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The first rule of Project --

                             JACK
                 Right, right.

     As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-
     BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.

     EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

     Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a
     Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a
     ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken
                 Heart.

     Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A
     Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.

                             JACK
                 Get away from me!

                             MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                 Who are all these people?

     Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.

                             JACK
                 The Paper Street Soap Company.

                             MARLA
                 Can I come in?

                             JACK
                 He's not here.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here
                 anymore!  He's gone away!

     Marla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her
     cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go.
     There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.
     Jack heads to the back door...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to
     the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating
     the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in
     BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.

                             JACK
                 What's going on?

     Space Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating,
     gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --
     it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.

                             JACK
                 Bob... oh, Christ...

     Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...

                             JACK
                 What... what happened... ?

                             MECHANIC
                       (out of breath)
                 We were on assignment...

     EXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     A SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We were supposed to kill two birds
                 with one stone:

     A SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 A piece of corporate art...

     The GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one
     parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and
     causing windows to explode...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 ... and trash a trendy coffee bar.

     Then, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL...
     BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the
     front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows...
     DECIMATING coffee push-pats...

     EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS)

     Bob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their
     handiwork.  They split up, running O.S.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We had it all worked out, man.  It
                 went smooth... until...

                             HARSH VOICE
                 Police!  Freeze!

     O.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING)

     The Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse.

                             MECHANIC
                 They shot Bob... they shot him in the
                 head.  Those fuckers...

     Jack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his
     head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 We gotta do something.

                             RICKY
                 We got to get rid of the evidence.
                 We have to get rid of this body.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 Bury him...

     Jack looks around in disbelief.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The garden.  Take him there.  Move,
                 people.  Let's do this!

     Several Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body.

                             JACK
                 No... !

     Space Monkeys stop.  Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES
     a few Space Monkeys back...

                             JACK
                 Get your hands off him!  Get off...!
                 What the hell do you think you're
                 doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a
                 man... !  You killed him!

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed in action.

                             JACK
                 No!  Look at you!  You're... you're
                 running around in ski masks,
                 exploding things...

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed serving Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY
                 It's what he would have wanted, sir.

                             JACK
                 What he wanted?  Look... look at him.
                 Look at him!  What does he want?

                 in your machine...

                 But, this is Project Mayhem.

                             JACK
                 No, no.  This is a man -- this man
                 has a name...

                             RICKY
                 But, in Project Mayhem, we have no
                 names.

                             JACK
                 No!  Wrong!  This man's name is
                 Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY
                 Robert Paulson?

                             JACK
                 Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead,
                 because of you...

                             MECHANIC
                 I understand.

     Everyone just stares at Jack.

                             MECHANIC
                 In death, a member of Project Mayhem
                 has a name.

                             JACK
                 No -- !

                             MECHANIC
                 His name is Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY
                 His name is Robert Paulson!

                             JACK

     Jack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room.

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers.
     He finds FLIGHT COUPONS, used and unused.  The used coupons.
     have the flight information, including the destination
     cities.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it...

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                 unit.  I'd like to see you in my

     Jack, in a panic, HANGS UP.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I went to the cities on Tyler's used

     Jack hurries from the terminal, runs to a TAXI ...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In every city, I branched out from
                 the airport to downtown, bar-
                 hopping...

     INT. TAXI - IN MOTION, MID-CITY - NIGHT

     Jack's looks out the window, intently watching buildings.

                             JACK (V.0.)
                 I didn't know how or why, but I could
                 look at fifty different bars, and
                 somehow I just knew...

                             JACK
                       (to driver, points)
                 Here.  Let me out, right here...

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  He sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT
     BRUISES.  Jack moves to the bar.  The BARTENDER has a broken
     arm and swollen face.

                             JACK
                 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

                             BARTENDER
                 Never heard of him.

                             JACK
                 This is an emergency.  It's important
                 I find him.

                             BARTENDER
                 I wish I could help you... sir.

     The bartender WINKS at Jack.

     Jack RUNS through the airport, lugging his suitcase.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler was setting up franchises, all
                 over the country.

     INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

     The PROPRIETOR, his head bandaged, is confronted by Jack.

                             JACK
                 I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't
                 you help me?

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 Sir, you're disturbing the other
                 patrons with your laudish behavior.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 There's no one else here.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest
                 idea what you're talking about.

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I
                 just need to know if you've seen
                 Tyler Durden.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such
                 information to you, nor would I, even
                 if I had said information you want,
                 at this juncture be able.

     Jack looks around, incredibly frustrated.

                             JACK
                  You are a moron.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                  I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

     Jack gives up, shoves his way out the door.

     INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     Jack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  The bus stops.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything I took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     OUT THE WINDOW, a CONSTRUCTION WORKER with a BROKEN NOSE
     works a jackhammer.  He stops, wipes his brow.

     INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

     TVs show football.  Jack is seated with TWO BRUISED PATRONS.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 No one's ever seen him.  No one knows
                 what he looks like.

                             BRUISED PATRON #2
                 He has facial reconstructive surgery
                 every three years.

                             JACK
                 That's the stupidest thing I've ever
                 heard.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 Is it true about fight club in Miami?

                             BRUISED PATRON 12
                 Is Mr. Durden building an army?

     solemnly stand in a circle, chanting...

                             KITCHEN WORKERS
                 His name is Robert Paulson.  His name

                 Welcome back, sir.

     Jack whirls, startled -- facing the wounded BARTENDER, who
     wears a NECK BRACE, his nose a smashed eggplant.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 How have you been?

                             JACK
                 ... You know me?

                             JACK
                 Yes... it's a test.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You were in here last Thursday night.

                             JACK

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You were standing right where you are
                 now, asking how good our security is.
                 It's tight as a drum.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think I am?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 Is this part of the test?

     Jack nods slowly.  The Bartender holds up his hand, shows
     the KISS SCAR on the back of his hand...

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You're the one who did this to me.
                 You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Please return your seatbacks to their
                 full upright and locked position.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack bursts inside, out of breath, runs to grab the phone,
     punches a number, doesn't bother to turn on the lamp.

                 Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we
                 ever had sex?

                 that?!

                             JACK
                 Because the answer's "yes" or because
                 the answer's "no?"

                             MARLA
                 Is this a trick?

                             JACK
                 Will you just answer me, for
                 Christsake?!

                             MARLA
                 You mean, you want to know if I think
                 we were just having sex or making
                 love?

                             JACK
                 We did make love?

                             MARLA
                 Is that what you're calling it?

                             JACK
                 Answer the question!

                             MARLA
                 You fuck me, then snub me.  You love
                 me, you hate me.  You show me your
                 sensitive side, then you turn into a
                 total asshole!  Is that a pretty
                 accurate description of our
                 relationship, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 Four in Milwaukee.

                             JACK
                 What's this all about, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 And, we're definitely filling a void
                 in the rural South.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm you?

                             TYLER
                 You broke your promise.  You talked
                 to her about me.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

                             TYLER
                 Why did you do that?

                             JACK
                 Answer me, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Why do people think anything?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Tell me!

     Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated.

                             TYLER
                 People think that you're me, because
                 you and I happen to share the same
                 body.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Is this really news to you?

                             JACK
                 What are you talking about... ?

                             TYLER
                 Sometimes I control it, and you
                 imagine yourself watching me...

     FLASHBACK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Commissioner Jacobs checks his tie in a mirror, goes to open
     the door of the MEN'S BATHROOM -- face to face with JACK.

     FLASHBACK - LOU'S BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

     JACK stands surrounded by eager fight club MEMBERS, under
     the bare bulb, talking and behaving like Tyler...

                             JACK
                 The first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 And, sometimes you control it...

     FLASHBACK - EXT. PAPER STREET HOUSE - DAY

     Jack stands in the yard, VODKA in hand, yells at Marla.

                             JACK
                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here
                 anymore!  He's gone away!

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 You can see me and hear me, but no
                 one else can...

     FLASHBACK - CURBSIDE - NIGHT

     JACK sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway.
     He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there.

                             JACK
                 Anyone?
                       (thinks)
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

     Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't really know my Dad...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 But, when you fall asleep, I do
                 things without you...

     FLASHBACK - TYLER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     JACK is on top of Marla, sweating, making violent love...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 I go places without you.  Get things
                 done...

     FLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT

     The Parker Morris Building.

     JACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the
     side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is "TYLER" in demeanor,
     mannerisms, speech...

                             JACK
                       (shouting)
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

     TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell:

                             BRUISED MAN #1
                 I am not my job!

                             BRUISED MAN #2
                 I am not how much money I have in the
                 bank!

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands.

                             TYLER
                 There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing
                 from you... one simple promise.  Now
                 look what you've done!

                             JACK
                 This isn't possible...

                             TYLER
                 We're going to have to do something
                 about Marla...

                             JACK
                 What... what are you saying?

                             TYLER
                 It's okay.  We okay... a little
                 codependent, sure, but...

     Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...

                             JACK
                 No!  This isn't true.  We... we were
                 around other people, together, both
                 of us...

                                  TYLER
                 You never talked to me in front of
                 anyone else.

                             JACK
                 Wrong, wrong -- what about the car
                 crash... the two guys in the backseat?

                             TYLER
                 What about them?  They're lunatics.

                             JACK
                 You took me to the house.

                             TYLER
                 The house is rented in your name.

                             JACK
                 You have jobs.

                             TYLER
                 Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

                             JACK
                 What about Marla?

                             TYLER
                 What about Marla?

                             JACK
                 She's... you... you're fucking her.

                             TYLER
                 Um, well... technically, no.

     Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find
     words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

     Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the
     previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at
     the clock -- 4:35am.

     INT. HALLWAY

     The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room,
     carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his
     suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him...

     INT. LOBBY

     Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken
     open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Please initial this list of phone
                 calls.

                             JACK
                 Bill me!

     Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going
     to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.

                             JACK
                 Wait...when were these made?

                             DESK CLERK
                 It says right there, sir... between
                 two and three-thirty this morning.

     Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.

                             JACK
                 I need a copy of this.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY

     Jack stares out the window, his face set hard.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Had I been going to bed earlier every
                 night?  Have I been sleeping later?
                 Has Tyler been in charge longer and
                 longer?

     EXT. PAPER STREET - DAY

     A TAXI halts.  Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE.

                             JACK
                 Wait here.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He
     continues on into the KITCHEN, gawks at BATHTUBS and
     CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES,
     GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS.

     He picks up a BOTTLE labeled "NITRIC ACID."

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM

     Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his
     finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Deja vu, all over again...

     Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear.

                             VOICE
                       (from phone)
                 Eighteen-eighty-eight.

     Jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 CENTURY PARK EAST."

                             JACK
                 Who is this?

                             VOICE
                 Maintenance.

                             JACK
                 Listen, something is going to happen,
                 something terrible...

                             VOICE
                 Very good, Sir.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?

                             VOICE
                 Don't worry about us, sir.  We're
                 solid.

                             JACK
                 Now wait, there's been a mix-up.
                 Everything's changed...

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 Abort the plan.

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist
                 dickhead?!

                             VOICE
                 Well, sir, you said you might.

     Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill.

                             DIFFERENT VOICE
                       (front phone)
                 Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.

     Jack sees a file: "2160 PICO BOULEVARD."  He throws the
     phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees
     Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...

                             JACK
                 Marla!

     Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows,
     hugging the files to his chest, catching up.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me
                 with a fucking broom.  I thought they
                 were going to break my arm.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, I...

                             MARLA
                 The were burning their fingertips
                 with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.

                             JACK
                 Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's
                 going to take a tremendous act of
                 faith on your part for you to hear me
                 out.

                             MARLA
                 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

     Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows...

                             JACK
                 -- A little more faith than that.

     INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her.

                             MARLA
                 I don't want to hear anything you've
                 got to say.

                             JACK
                 Give me a minute, Marla, alright...
                 just sixty seconds.

                             MARLA
                 Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.

                             JACK
                 Absolutely, you have every right.  I
                 need you to do me a favor.

                             MARLA
                 I've done you enough favors.

     A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table.

                             WAITER
                 Sir!  Anything you order is free of
                 charge, sir.

                             MARLA
                 Why is it free of charge?

                             JACK
                 Because... I'm Tyler Durden.

                             MARLA
                 Then, I'll have the clam chowder...
                 fried chicken and a baked potato with
                 everything and a chocolate chiffon
                 pie.

     Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where
     THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces.

                             JACK
                 Clean food, please.

                             WAITER
                 In that case, sir, may I advise
                 against the lady eating the clam
                 chowder?

                             JACK
                 Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it.

     The waiter snaps to attention and leaves.

                             MARLA
                 You got about thirty seconds.

                             JACK
                       (takes a deep breath)
                 I know that I've been... unwell.  I
                 know it's been like there's two sides
                 to me.

                             MARLA
                 Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr.
                 Jackass.

                             JACK
                 I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've
                 only just realized

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 I mean, the depth and breadth of our
                 relationship has only recently been
                 illuminated for me.  I know this...
                 I know us hasn't been such a great
                 thing for you...

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.
                       (to waiter)
                 I'll take my food to go...

     Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her
     by the arm, putting her back in her seat.

                             JACK
                 Sit down!  Sit down and give me my
                 last fifteen seconds without opening
                 your mouth!

     Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself.

                             JACK
                 I'm trying to tell you -- and this is
                 where you have to trust me -- but, I
                 think your life might be in real
                 danger.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 You have to get out of here.  Leave
                 as soon as possible.  Go to any rural
                 town, away from any major city...

                             MARLA
                 You are an insane person.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 No, no, shut up!  I've had enough.
                 I tried, Tyler... I have tried...

     Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.

                             MARLA
                 There's a part of you I really like,
                 but I can't do this anymore.  I just
                 can't.  This is killing me...

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, but I...

                             MARLA
                 What?!  You're sorry?  I don't
                 believe that for a minute.

     Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading
     for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...

     EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER

     Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...

                             JACK
                 I can't explain.  You wouldn't
                 believe me anyway.  I'm trying to
                 protect you...

     Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races
     past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,

                             MARLA
                 Let go of me!

                             JACK
                 Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for
                 me, if you never do anything else...

     Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.

                             MARLA
                 Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to
                 see you again!

                             JACK
                 Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
                 never have to see me again.
                       (digs in his pocket)
                 Here... here...

     He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.

                             JACK
                 Take this money, get on this bus...
                       (pointing to bus)
                 Get on, and I promise you, I'll never
                 bother you again, if that's what you
                 want.  Please...

     Marla looks at Jack, numb.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

                             JACK
                 I'm begging you.  Get on the bus.
                 Get on the bus.

     Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As
     they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...

                             MARLA
                 Why are you doing this?

                             JACK
                 I can't let myself see where you're
                 going.  Go wherever it takes you,
                 remember... keep away from major
                 cities...

     Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
     last look at Jack.

                             MARLA
                       (holds up the money)
                 I'm not paying this back.  I consider
                 it "asshole tax."

                             JACK
                 Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away
                 a couple of weeks, at least.

     Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

     Jack finally looks to her.

                             MARLA
                 You are the worst thing that ever
                 happened to me.

     DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems
     relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...

     Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is
     filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.

     Jack SPRINTS after the bus...

     The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.

     Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.

                             JACK
                 Son of a bitch!

     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of
     files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...

                             JACK
                       (loudly)
                 I want you to arrest me.  I'm the
                 leader of a terrorist organization
                 responsible for acts of vandalism all
                 over the city.  Detective Stern in
                 arson knows who I am...

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,
     who's seated.  On the table are the phone bill and files.

                             JACK
                 There are probably several hundred
                 members in the metropolitan area.
                 Chapters are sprouting in at least
                 five other major cities.  They're
                 tightly-regimented, with many cells
                 capable of operating without a
                 central leader.  Check this address:
                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the
                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the
                 garden.  You'll also find numerous
                 tubs used to make gallons of
                 nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,
                 is to blow up these credit card
                 headquarters and the TRW building.

                             STERN
                 Why these buildings?

                             JACK
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

                             STERN
                       (to other detectives)
                 Keep him talking.

     Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile
     at Jack with REVERENCE.

                             FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE
                 I really admire what you're doing.
                 You're a brave man to order this.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             REDHEAD DETECTIVE
                 You're a genius, sir.

     They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.
     Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.

                             BALD DETECTIVE
                 You know the drill.  You said if
                 anyone ever tries to interfere with
                 Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
                 get his balls.

     Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them
     aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.

                             FLAT-TOP
                 It's useless to fight.

                             REDHEAD
                 This is really a powerful gesture,
                 Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an
                 example.

                             JACK
                 No... you're making a mistake!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You told us you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 I'm not Tyler Durden!

                             BALDY
                 You told us you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm
                 ordering you to abort the mission!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You said you would definitely say
                 that.

                             BALDY
                 What's our best time for a "cut and
                 run?"

                             FLAT-TOP
                 Four minutes.

                             BALDY
                 Is somebody timing this?

                             REDHEAD
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Wait till the second hand gets to the
                 twelve.

     A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's
     mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy
     opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:

                             STERN
                 Some of this info checks out.  Let's
                 go to the place on Paper Street.

     Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing
     the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks
     and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but
     with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.

                             REDHEAD
                       (checking his watch)
                 Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up
                 the time!

     Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --
     Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of
     Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting
     off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...

     Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN
     and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,
     gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.

     Jack grabs one of the files off the table.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK
     DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.

     EXT. STREET

     Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,
     looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him.

     EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER

     Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads
     toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."

     EXT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench,
     runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench
     immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!
     Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.
     Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...

     INT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the
     "PARKING" door...

     INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING

     Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS...

     INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR

     Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one
     SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies,
     across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.

     Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.
     There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...

     Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse...

     Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.

                             TYLER
                 You could be standing under 37
                 stories of steel and concrete with a
                 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped
                 to the support... oh, maybe it
                 couldn't be...

                             JACK
                       (points at bomb)
                 You... you can't be serious about
                 this.

                             TYLER
                 What a ridiculous thing to say.

                             JACK
                 I can't let you...

                             TYLER
                              ...go through with this?
                 What are you going to do?

                             JACK
                 I'm going to...

                             TYLER
                           ...stop me?

                             JACK
                 I'm not going...

                             TYLER
                            ...to let this happen!

                             JACK
                 Stop finishing...

                             TYLER
                         ...your sentences!  They're
                 our sentences.  Get your mind around
                 that.

     Tyler gets up walks to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing running through
                 the streets in your underpants?  We
                 both use that body.

                             JACK
                 Since when is Project Mayhem about
                 murder?

                             TYLER
                 The buildings were evacuated thirty
                 minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding
                 exactly as planned.

                             JACK
                 You don't know that.  There could
                 still be people inside.

     Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.

                             TYLER
                 Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with
                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize
                 their watches.  Good riddance.

     Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his
     face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.

                             TYLER
                 I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you
                 know which wires, in what order...

                             JACK
                 If you know, I know.

     Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go
     through the tangle of colored wires.

                             TYLER
                 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I
                 spent the whole day thinking about
                 the wrong ones.

     Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.

                             JACK
                 If I'm wrong, we're both dead..

                             TYLER
                 This is not about martyrdom.

     Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.

                             JACK
                 I'm pulling the green wire.

                             TYLER
                 Green?  Did you say green?

     Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,
     seems genuinely concerned.

                             JACK
                 Yes...

                             TYLER
                 Don't pull the green wire.  Pull
                 anything but the green wire.

                             JACK
                 Fuck you.

                             TYLER
                 I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

     Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers
     trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...

                             TYLER
                 Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in
                 the nick of time, eh?

     Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...

                             TYLER
                 See for yourself.

     Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,
     keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...

     BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,
     kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...

                             MARLA
                 You motherfuckers...

     They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.

     Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.

                             TYLER
                 I've got everything.  The bombs.  The
                 army.  I've got Marla.

                             JACK
                 Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew
                 a hole in his head.  Was that part of
                 your plan?

     Tyler thinks, shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Bob was a grown man.  In any great
                 struggle, there will be casualties.
                 Wouldn't that be implicit in the
                 name?  Project "Mayhem."

                             JACK
                 Fuck your struggle.  I want out.

                             TYLER
                 You want out?

                             JACK
                 I quit.

                             TYLER
                 Not an option, for the most obvious
                 of reasons.  You need to get with the
                 program.
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.

     Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He
     points the gun at Tyler...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                       (still walking away)
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (COCKS the gun)
                 Defuse the bomb.

     Tyler stops walking.

                             TYLER
                 Ask me nicely.

                             JACK
                 Defuse the bomb, please.

                             TYLER
                 Defuse the bomb?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...

                             JACK
                 Please.

     Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the
     GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.

     Jack lowers his gun.

                             TYLER
                 I did that for you.  As a gesture.
                 Now, how fast can you run?  There are
                 ten other bombs, in ten other
                 buildings in the immediate area.  If
                 you're going to get them all, you
                 better get cracking.
                       (looks at watch)
                 Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.
                 I'll be upstairs.

     Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past
     Jack, heading for the STAIRS.

     Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!

     Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

     Tyler spins to face Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Whoa!  What was that all about?

     Jack aims... FIRES!

     Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.

     Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the
     post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps,
     moving the gun from side to side...

     Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.

     Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...

     Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun,
     scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...

     Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.

     Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run
     into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack
     RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM
     down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor.

     Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his
     gun...

                             TYLER
                 Fire at will.

     Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.
     Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms.

                             TYLER
                 What did you expect?

     Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of
     Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking
     each other to the floor...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.

     ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,
     alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up,
     punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING
     himself in the side of the head...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to
     get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's
     head against the floor...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his
     own head against the floor, over and over...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.
     Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.

     Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...

     ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the
     lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind,
     turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.

     Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He
     wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack
     turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls
     against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,
     SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...

     Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head
     on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR

     CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He
     looks around, trying to focus his eyes...

     JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from
     where his body was dragged across to where he is how.

     CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head --
     TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S
     MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...

                                                      PULL BACK TO:

     Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in
     Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being
     remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling
     windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.

     Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I think this is about where we came
                 in.

                             TYLER
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I still can't think of anything.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

     Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplished.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.
                       (looks out windows)
                 Out these windows, we will view the
                 economic collapse.  One step closer
                 to global equilibrium.  I'm glad
                 you're here with me.

     Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.

                             JACK
                       (distorted)
                 Can't you call it off... ?

                             TYLER
                 It's out of our hands.
                       (looks at watch)
                 This is it.

                             JACK
                 Please...

                             TYLER
                 Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see
                 alright?  10... 9... 8....

     Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,
     excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing.

                             TYLER
                 5... 4... 3... 2...

     Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A
     long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.

     Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely
     surprised, pissed-off.

                             TYLER
                 What the fuck -- ?

                             JACK
                 Paraffin.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (relieved)
                 Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the
                 nitro with paraffin.  I saw it
                 floating in the bomb.
                             (more)

                             JACK (cont)
                 They must've run out of cotton and
                 Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best.

     Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts
     pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.

                             TYLER
                 Damn it!  God-damn it...

                             JACK
                 Not exactly according to plan.

                             TYLER
                 Do we have to do everything
                 ourselves?!

     Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches
     into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 ... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First
                 Strike...

     Jack's eyes go wide.

                             JACK
                 NO...

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 Proceed with remote detonation.

     Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack
     STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles
     off...

     Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to
     his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.

                             TYLER
                 Haven't we already done this?

     Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.
     Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the
     floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking
                 figment of my imagination... you're
                 psychogenic fugue state...

                             TYLER
                 Fuck that, maybe you're my
                 hallucination.

     Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie-
     talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE
     CRUSHED under his own foot.

                             JACK
                 Oh... Christ...

     Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.

                             JACK
                 Why... why... why... ?

                             TYLER
                 Why what?

                             JACK
                 Why can't I get rid of you?  Why
                 can't I just wish you away?

                             TYLER
                 You need me.

                             JACK
                 No, no, I don't.
                       (pause)
                 I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,
                 but I don't need you anymore.

                             TYLER
                 Look, I can be selfish, I know that.
                       (pause)
                 I'm not blind to my own failings...

                             JACK
                 Noooo, please...

     Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.

                             TYLER
                 From now on, we'll share Marla.
                 We've been spending too much time
                 apart...

                             JACK
                 ... no, no, no...

                             TYLER
                 No more running off without you.
                 From here on out, we do it together.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?!

                             TYLER
                 I'm doing this for us.

                             JACK
                 Please understand... I've gotten all
                 I can from this, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                       (sullen)
                 If I leave, you will be right back
                 where I found you...

                             JACK
                 I swear on my life, I won't...

                             TYLER
                 You will.  You know you will.

     Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head.  He
     looks at the gun in his hand...

                             TYLER
                 Can you live with that?

     Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...

     Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.

     Tyler cocks his head.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

                             JACK
                 What have you left for me?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you want to do that? Why do
                 you want to put that gun in your
                 mouth?

                             JACK
                 Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

     Tyler is calm.

                             TYLER
                 This is interesting.

     Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands
     very close to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Why are you going with this, Ikea-
                 boy?

                             JACK
                 It's the only way to get rid of you...

     Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.

                             TYLER
                 I can see you feel very strongly.  I
                 feel strongly too.
                       (pause)
                 Hey, you and me.
                       (pause)
                 Friends again?

     Their eyes are locked, unblinking.  Long silence.

                             JACK
                 Do something for me.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Appreciate something.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Look at me...

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 My eyes are open.

     EXTREME SLOW MOTION:

     Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...

     KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.
     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him
     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.

     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...

     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...

                             TYLER
                 What's that smell... ?

     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...

     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN
     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,
     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.

                             TALL SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you all right, sir... ?!

     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole
     blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.

                             JACK
                 I'm okay...

     Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to
     see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun
     to Marla as she struggles.

                             SHORT SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you sure?  You look terrible,
                 sir!  What's happened?

                             JACK
                 Everything's fine.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 Sir, you look really awful!  Do you
                 need medical assistance?

     Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...

                             JACK
                 Bring the girl to me.  The rest of
                 you get out.  Now!

     The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.

                             MARLA
                 What happened... ?

                             JACK
                 Don't ask.

     Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.
     them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.

                             JACK
                 Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!

     Jack and Marla are left alone.

                             MARLA
                 My God, you're shot...

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.

                             MARLA
                 Who did this to you?

                             JACK
                 I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm
                 fine...

     MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...

     Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;
     collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES
     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are
     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,
     reaches to take her hand.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry... you met me at a very
                 strange time in my life.

     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES
     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...

     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING
     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING
     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING
     BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket
     holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

          FADE IN:
                         
          EXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNING
                         
          At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an
          endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums
          beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.
                         
          The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:
          the white disc goes through a rapid series of color
          transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible
          BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.
                         
          The sky echoes with THUNDER.
                         
          We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush
          stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with
          each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
                         
          Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning
          blood-red savanna.
                         
          EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
                         
          I's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It
          buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's
          almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.
                         
          INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY
                         
          There are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN,
          a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and
          reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A
          Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the
          open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.
          He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed
          things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows
          indicating the directions of movement.
                         
          Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks
          the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with
          sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture
          that's habitual to her in moments of stress.
                         
          There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She
          looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,
          leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.
                         
          INT. PLANE/ COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
          (CO-P:ILOT, DALE, FLASH, PILOT)
                         
                          FLASH
           What was that, fellas?
           2.
                         
                          PILOT
           Clear-air turbulence, is all. Nothing
                          SERIOUS
                         
                          CO-PILOT
           But nothing you'd want to toss a
           third-down pass through either --
           (Grinning back at
                          FLASH)
           Can I have an autograph for my kid,
           Mr. Gordon?
                         
                          FLASH
           Sure -- my pleasure.
                         
          As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane
          takes another jolt, even more violent than the first.
                         
                          PILOT
           Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see
           what they've got.
                         
                          FLASH
           I sure hope we don't have to turn
           back. I mean this is first day of
           training camp, I wouldn't want to be
                          LATE --
                         
                          PILOT
           Seat-belt time.
                         
          FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders
          violently. He holds on, calls up front:
                         
                          FLASH
           Maybe it'd be smoother if you went
                          HIGHER --
                         
                          DALE
           Will you SHUT UP?
           (as FLASH's head
                          SWIVELS)
           Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have
           their hands full -- just let 'em
           drive.
                         
          INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS
          (DALE, FLASH)
                         
          The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of
          the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to
          her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it
          to her.
           3.
                         
                          FLASH
           When you're nervous, it can help to
           chew on something
                         
                          DALE
           Thanks a lot -- I look dumb enough
           to take candy from a stranger?
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm not a stranger exactly -- You
           know my name.
                         
                          DALE
           Who doesn't. Number one draft pick,
           cover of PEOPLE mag -- what'd the
           GIANTS sign you for, eighty-nine
           million? Big deal!
                         
                          FLASH
           Of course.
                         
                          DALE
           God, I hate flying -- I'm Dale Arden
           it's crazy of me to hate flying --
           I'm a travel agent, you see? -- I've
           just been checking out a little hotel
           in Vermont -- can I still have that
           candy bar?
           (and in the same breath)
           Are we going backward?
                         
                          FLASH
           Backwards?
                         
                          DALE (GASP)
           Holy cow! Look at the clouds!
                         
          EXT. SKY - POV FROM PLANE WINDOW - DAY
                         
          The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to
          surround the airplane. Over the engines we HEAR that same
          ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening. Slowly
          and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning BLOOD RED. The clouds
          race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past
          the plane from behind.
                         
          INT. PLANE - DAY
                         
          FLASH and DALE -- faces bathed in the eerie light. Speechless-
          DALE grasps the football player's hand with all her strength.
                         
          EXT. A FANTASTIC GREENHOUSE - DAY
                         
          It is a huge and rambling, antique, standing in semiruinous
          isolation in a pretty country landscape. The sun has turned
           4.
                         
          the SAME BLOOD RED we saw from the airplane, and clouds race
          across it with unnatural velocity.
                         
          In the center of the greenhouse rises a glass-paned tower
          through which we glimpse something MIRROR BRIGHT. Floating
          high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-
          filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we
          discern a MAN moving about actively on a platform inside the
          central tower, about half-way up:
                         
          INT. GREENHOUSE TOWER - DAY
          (MUNSON, TV NEWSMAN, ZARKOV)
                         
          The man is DR. HANS ZARKOV: big, bearded, feverish looking
          and seemingly half mad with exhaustion. In striking contrast
          to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds
          of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash
          fashion. Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and
          dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. As
          Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a
          grim-voiced TV. NEWSMAN is appearing and speaking from a
          good-sized television screen above the main control console:
                         
                          TV NEWSMAN
           The extraordinary weather disturbances
           reported from Africa this morning
           are now crossing the Atlantic, and
           are expected to reach the East Coast
           of the United States by noon.
           According to scientists at NASA, the
           Earth is being struck by an immense
           stream of cosmic energy, apparently
           the result of some catastrophic
           stellar accident beyond the reaches
                          OF --
                         
          ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the
          silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Fools! Can't you understand? This
           is no accident-- it's an ATTACK! An
           attack planned by a MIND! This is
           ATTACK!
                         
          MUNSON, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the
          stairs with a computer print-out sheet.
                         
                          MUNSON
           Dr. Zarkov! Look at the report from
           the last balloon!
                         
          ZARKOV grabs it, eyes it.
           5.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           I predicted it, didn't I?
                         
                          MUNSON
           Yes, sir -- you sure did. And this
           funny sun too ---
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Ozone layer starting to crack up.
           By tonight Carbon dioxide will be
           combining with free nitrogen to form --
           (breaks off, crumpling
                          THE SHEET)
           Well, this is it.
                         
                          MUNSON
           Sir, the President is on the TV behind
                          YOU --
                         
                          ZARKOV
           What the hell do I care? I tried to
           warn him -- he called me mad, like
           all the others.
                         
          BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.
                         
                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)
           Time for us to go, Munson. Get your
           toothbrush and whatever.
                         
                          MUNSON
           Go where?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Up. Up and at him.
                         
          Stunned, MUNSON turns his head and glances at something big
          and MIRROR BRIGHT gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.
                         
                          MUNSON
           You're crazy!
                         
          Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes,
          ZARKOV pulls out a revolver and points it at MUNSON.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           I can't handle the capsule alone get

          INT. COCKPIT TO SKY - POV
          (CO-PILOT, PILOT)
                         
          The PILOTS watch these clouds also, transfixed with disbelief.
          They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of
          professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe.

           Say, get a load of the VOR's....
                         
          The directional needles are going crazy. All the instruments
          are going crazy. Displays flash impossible symbols. The
          PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the
          sky and swallows.

           On the left, about six o'clock

          The racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some
          surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED
          LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the
          plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE.
                         
                          PILOT (CONT'D)
           Hold on tight, let's put baby down
           right here......
                         
          The CO-PILOT reaches up and hits the flap control. There is
          a whooshing crackling ZAP! The whole cockpit FLARES OUT
          with an intolerable blinding flash of RED LIGHT.
                         
          INT. PASSENGER CABIN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The cockpit door flys off its hinges, admitting a gale of
          wind that scatters FLASH'S play sheets like autumn leaves.
          FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward.
                         
          INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
          (DALE, FLASH)
                         
          The TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from
          the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He
          stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering
          he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the
          bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals.
          DALE lurches in against the tornado.
                         
                          DALE

          DALE staggers into the co-pilot's seat, pulls back on the
          wheel in front of her.

          flat area.
                         
          Another barrage of crackling RED LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot all

          Its thousands of panes reflect the RED SUN and the RED BOLTS
          which rain down in intermittent bursts. One strikes an end
          of a gallery, exploding glass and foliage. From inside, we
          HEAR a furious echoing VOICE:
                         
                          ZARKOV'S VOICE

          ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his
          revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he
          was hiding.
                         
                          MUNSON
           So what's it matter if I'm shot or
           go up in that thing? I'm a goner
           either way, right?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Of course -- I admit that! But this
           way you'll be giving your life for a
           chance of saving Earth! Haven't you
           any spirit at all??
                         
                          MUNSON
           Goodbye, Doctor -- they were all
           right about you. Have a nice trip.
                         
          MUNSON starts walking away, toward the door at the end of
          the long side wing.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           I tell you I can't take it off alone!
           If you won't come, who will I find?
                         
          If you woo't come, who will I find:
                         
          MUNSON ignores him totally, keeps walking away. ZARKOV lifts
          his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back. Just as he
          is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside.
                         
          EXT. GREENHOUSE
                         
          Amazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough
          landing in the field outside. The plane hits on one wheel,
          bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on
          rolling toward the greenhouse.

          SEEING the onrushing plane, freezing an instant then starting
          to run. He hardly gets five yards before the Twin Otter comes
          SLAMMING IN through the greenhouse wall, burying MUNSON
          totally under the wreckage.

           Certainly. Just follow me -- up those
           stairs.

           It will get worse.
                         
          ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the
          tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV
          with a funny expression.
                         
                          DALE

                          ZARKOV

          BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that

          FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off-
          balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her.

          on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but
          in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed
          from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is
          from everyday science.
                         
          Immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity,
          ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH.

           12.
                         
          ZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He
          punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the
          well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again.
          Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch.
                         
          The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out
          through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself
          was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's
          left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those
          LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy.
                         
          FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms
          around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly
          increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster
          and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back
          against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.
                         
          We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part
          of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted
          by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving
          as he speaks with enormous effort:
                         
           ZARKOV,
           Friendship...Built this to send to
           them in...Friendship...The end
           now...End of the world....Unless we
                          ····
           (every sound an effort
                          NOW)
           Unless...We...Three...Can...
                         
          ZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness.
                         
          EXT. GREENHOUSE - LONG SHOT (MINIATURE)
                         
          Totally ablaze within now, one huge fantastic jewel of fire.
          The whole central tower explodes outward. From the inferno a
          MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking
          up speed again as it ascends.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT
                         
          Whirling, whirling, invincibly unharmed by the LASER BOLTS
          which glance off it again and again, accelerating up into
          space.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT - POV
                         
          The EARTH recedes below into a ball, RED-HUED' under the
          fantastic sun. A fast approaching light FLARES up against
          the mirrored surface and is recognised as our MOON. It flashes
          past, follows EARTH into e distance. All around, the sky
          darkens into the void of space.
                         
          FANTASTIC MONTAGE - OUTER PLANETS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
           13.
                         
          They hurtle past the capsule in rapid sequences:
                         
                         RED MARS
                         
          A sudden gauntlet of careening ASTEROIDS, all sizes, from
          tiny zingers to one almighty tumbler big as AFRICA.
                         
          Mammoth JUPITER with thirteen moons and its atmosphere of
          deadly methane clouds more than 1000 miles deep. The RED
          PATCH on its surface is a storm 20,000 miles across which
          has raged without intermission for 200 EARTH centuries.
          Through the RINGS OF SATURN in a dazzling LIGHTSTORM of
          blazing ice crystals.
                         
          NEPTUNE, PLUTO, outermost URANUS. One after another the
          planets are left hurtling behind, wheeling in their concentric
          orbits, the entire SOLAR SYSTEM dwindling into nothing.
                         
          EXT. A SPIRAL NEBULA
                         
          It tilts and wheels wondrously as the Capsule passes through
          the middle of it. Considering that this Nebula is probably a
          million light-years from edge to edge, we get some notion of
          the Capsule's speed.
                         
          EXT. A BLACK HOLE IN SPACE
                         
          Curving light-rays from another galaxy are drawn fantastically
          together and then simply DISAPPEAR as they are pulled in by
          the unimaginable gravitation force of is THING. we SEE the
          CAPSULE, tiny, curving, and spinning along amidst the mind-
          blowing display of light rays, sucked along with them ····
          then simply DISAPPEARING as it too enters the void.
                         
          EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT
          (KLYTUS, MING)
                         
          Visible again, gleaming in an AMBER GLOW. Suddenly a dancing
          grid of lines appears OVER IT, making us realise that we
          must be SEEING IT on some kind of screen. It BLURS out of
          focus, comes back again more sharply as some adjustment has
          apparently been made.
                         
          ECU - EYES OF MING THE MERCILESS
                         
          Deep in shadow, gleaming with evil amusement.
                         
          MONTAGE - ECU'S OF MING'S FACIAL FEATURES
                         
          Curve of lip, flare of nostril, fold of eyelid, gleam of
          shaven scalp, each a menacing landscape of sensual shadow as
                         WE HEAR:

           They survived our Black Hole --

           KLYTUS (O.S.)
           Hail Ming! Shall I drown them in
           the Sea of Fire?
                         
           MING (O.S.)
           Later, Klytus -- I think we will
           look at them first.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE - SHOOTING FROM WITHIN
                         
          Through the transparent walls as the spinning motion is
          rapidly SLOWING DOWN. The three voyagers are crumpled on the
          floor against the wall in strange attitudes, FLASH'S arms
          still holding DALE. They seem semi-conscious, as if dropped.
                         
          An AMBER GLOW bathes them, and soon we see its source. A
          huge planet wheels into view through the transparent wall.
          It is MONGO. Its curved surface is a pure sea of AMBER FIRE
          molten lava, with great tongues of flame erupting
          horrifically.
                         
          ZARKOV blinks, struggles to focus his eyes. He succeeds,
          with horror SEES where they are headed. Making a choking
          sound, ZARKOV stirs and tries to crawl over to a control
          panel. He pushes switches. Nothing happens. The CAPSULE
          keeps on going down. A great leaping tongue of fire licks
          it.
                         
          Suddenly, just as destruction seems imminent, the capsule
          miraculously changes its flight path and soars above the
          remaining flames.
                         
          It races through them. A shadow passes over MONGO as the
          CAPSULE passes through a wall of PURPLE VAPOR and emerges
          above a totally different landscape. A dozen VARIOUS COLORED
          CLOUDS sweep past in silent majesty.
                         
          The CAPSULE slows, hovers starts straight down into a sea of
          high grass.
                         
          EXT. MONGO -- GRASSY AREA - EVENING
                         
          In the distant B.G. against an extraordinary SUNSET SKY,
          rises the shimmering CITY OF MONGO.... a place of many levels,
          golden tiers and turrets, towers, flags and pennants. It is
          like something dreamed.
                         
          Several STRANGELY ARMORED MEN watch the MIRROR-BRIGHT CAPSULE
          descending slowly. The LEADER waves and they all start toward
          the CAPSULE.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE
          (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)
                         
          Gentle bump as the thing touches down.
           15.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           By God, we did it! We made it!
                         
                          FLASH
           Made it where, Doctor?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           I don't know.
                         
          Suddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through
          the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and
          SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching.
                         
                          DALE
           Don't. Suddenly I like it in here
           just fine --

          (ARMORED MEN, FLASH, LEADER, ZARKOV)
                         
          The door of the CAPSULE is opened from the inside. ZARKOV
          and DALE and FLASH get out. THE MEN stop. Long beat as the
          two parties gaze at each other, the first human eye ever to
          see an extraterrestrial being. FLASH walks up to the leader.
                         
                          FLASH
           Hello -- my name's Flash Gordon --
           can you understand me?
                          (SILENCE)
           We're from EARTH -- we come as
           friends.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (URGENT)
           Extend your hand! That's the gesture
           of friendship known everywhere!
                         
          With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand.
                         
                          FLASH
           Hi!
                         
          CLACK! With lightning speed a manacle is slammed on FLASH'S
          wrist and he is thrown to ·the ground as other RED MEN advance
          to handcuff DALE and ZARKOV.
                         
                          LEADER
           You are prisoners. I will take you
           now to Ming the Merciless, Ruler of
           the universe!

           Hail, Ming!
           16.
                         
          Groggily, FLASH lifts his head towards ZARKOV.
                         
                          FLASH
           Thanks, Doctor -- next time I'll
           call my own play.
                         
          EXT. GRASSY AREA - POV THROUGH OPENING
          (DALE, FLASH)
                         
          Another strange glimpse through an opening. Some fierce
          tethered BEAST is being goaded and tormented by MONGO MEN,
          as in an Elizabethan bear-baiting. On the floor lies the
          tor n body of one MAN who apparently got too close.
                         
          DALE has one brief horrified GLIMPSE of this, then turns her
          head away and shuts her eyes as she's marched along.
                         
                          DALE
           Just do what I'm doing. Flash --
                         
                          FLASH
           What are you doing?
                         
                          DALE
           Shutting my eyes -- dreaming I booked
           us to Disneyland.
                         
          INT. MAIN PALACE HALL
                         (ARMORED MEN)
                         
          A gigantic STATUE comes into view amidst topless columns at
          the end. Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns. As
          we come nearer, we SEE that this STATUE is cut out in the
          middle to form a throne.
                         
          MING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing
          down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before
          him.
                         
                          ARMORED MEN
           Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
           Mercy!
                         
          A hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through
          unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly
          in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the
          left of the group.

          As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED
          MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces
           17.
                         
          bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable
          dimension.
                         
          We pass an archway opening into what seems to be an AMUSEME-
          NT ARCADE. Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic
          games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to
          unearthly music.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Fantastic -- into a Black Hole and
           out the other side -- to this. Who
           said Hans Zarkov was mad?
                         
                          DALE
           You're mad.
                         
          Look down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass
          is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic
          swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the
          blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist
          EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire.
                         
                          FLASH
           You got us into this -- HOW DO WE

                          ZARKOV
           Get out? Why? We're being taken to
           Ming -- getting at him is our only
           hope of saving EARTH. It's perfect!
                         
                          FLASH
           Dr. Zarkov, I'm about to show you
           what it feels like to be clipped by
           a New York Giant --
                         
                          DALE
           Flash, it's no use - he's too crazy!
                         
                          MING
           Step forward, Soldier.
                         
          The designated one marches two paces forward, halts.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           Are you loyal to Ming? Would you
           die for him?
                         
                          ARMORED MAN
           Gladly!
                         
                          MING
           Fall on your sword.
           18.
                         
          Instantly the ARMORED MAN pulls his sword, rips open his
          breast-plate, sets the sword hilt-down on the floor and
          PLUNGES FORWARD on to the fatal point.
                         
          With a little cry of horror, DALE shrinks back into FLASH'S
          arms.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           You inhuman fiend!
                         
                          MING
           Of course I'm "inhuman"! -- that's a
           compliment!
           (Dropping his voice)
           Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering
           if you are alone in the universe --
           beaming you plaintive messages into
           to the void for anything that might
           hear you -- even hurling your bodies
           out into it -- and all without the
           faintest inkling of who or what is
           out here. If you had known anything --
           anything at all about the true nature
           of the universe, you would have hidden
           from it, in terror!
                         
          There is a low throaty LAUGH from the shadows. FLASH and
          DALE turn their eyes quickly in its direction.
                         
          FEATURE PRINCESS AURA
                         
          Emerging half into the light beside a column, fondling the
          head of an obscure BEAST slouching between her legs.
          Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks
          FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure
          of her touch.
                         
          FLASH can't take his eyes off her. No normal man could. FLASH
          swallows with a dry throat as AURA'S gaze devours him. DALE
          gets the electricity going on, gives him a poke and WHISPERS
          LOUDLY.
                         
                          DALE
           Watch it, fella -- you came with me!
                         
          AURA laughs again, sidles up toward MING. We dimly SEE a
          couple of MUTANT CREATURES dragging away the lifeless body
          of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty.
                         
                          MING
           You know who Ming is now -- who are
           you and why do you come to Mongo?
           19.
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm Flash Gordon of the New York
           Giants this is Dale Arden -- Dr.Zarkov
           hijacked us in an effort to save
           EARTH.
                         
          MING looks questioningly at KLYTUS
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Sirs, Earth is the meaningless planet
           you are in the process of
           obliterating.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           (pouncing on that)
           In the process? You mean Earth still
           exists?
                         
                          MING
           For the moment -- not for much longer.
                         
                          FLASH
           But why? What in hell have we ever
           done to hurt you?
                         
                          MING
           You exist -- and yet you pay no homage
           to Ming! What greater crime can be
           committed?
                         
          The palace rings with an answering chorus: VOICES of all the
          ARMORED MEN and numerous others presently UNSEEN, including
          many WOMEN.
                         
                          VOICES
           Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without
           Mercy!
                         
                          MING
           Come closer, Dale Arden -- let me
           see you.
                         
          DALE doesn't move. MING takes a step down, narrows his eyes
          and gazes at her intensely. This guy's personal magnetism
          is enormous. As if irresistibly drawn, DALE steps forward.
                         
          MING moves his hand in a gesture. A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT
          bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard. DALE's lips
          open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing
          increases. MING touches her flesh lightly.
                         
          FLASH tense, ready to spring.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           This woman will amuse you.
           20.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (INTERESTED)
           Klytus can see the future, eh?
                         
                          MING
           He can foresee it -- but for a few
           moments only. It gives him a unique
           gift for survival, -- and treachery.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Extraordinary. I'd like to study
           his beta factors -- I wager I could
           extend them with a course of
           telekinetic exercise.
           (peering at KLYTUS)
           Tell me -- when you use this fit
           does your temporal lobe prickle?
           Here?
                         
          MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses
          the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN.
                         
                          MING
           Chain this one up. Preserve him for
           further examination.
                         
                          LEADER
           Hail, Ming!
                         
          ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily
          as they drag the scientist away.
                         
                          FLASH
           Oh no you don't! We came together
           and we're STAYING together!
                         
          Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger.
                         
                          MING
           That one is useless to us. Remove
           him and kill him.
                         
          Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in
          front of her friend.
                         
                          DALE
           You dirty old bastard can kill me
           too!
                         
          CLOSE ANGLE - AURA
                         
          Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING:
           21.
                         
                          AURA
           Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him
           to me!
                         
                          MING
                          (EYEBROWS UP)
           What would your Prince Barin say?
                         
                          AURA
           I can handle Barin.
                         
                          MING
           Really, Aura -- your appetites are
           too monstrous -- even for our family.
           This could cause great trouble with
           Barin -- I must forbid it.
                         
          AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she
                         WHISPERS AGAIN:
                         
                          AURA
           But you adore me, Father -- you ca
           refuse me nothing . Yes?
                         
                         WIDER SHOT
                         
          As MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter
          and indicates DALE.
                         
                          MING
           Take the Earth-woman to our quarters!
           Bathe and annoint her for our
           pleasure!
                         
          A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE.
                         
          FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it
          DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she
          flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city-
          girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own
          prowess.
                         
                          DALE
           My God -- and I thought that book
           was another rip-off-
                         
                          FLASH
           Watch out! Behind you!
                         
          Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards
          DALE.
                         
                         QUICK ANGLES
           22.
                         
          FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one.
          He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it
          quickly to knock cold the other two.
                         
          AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs
          her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth.
                         
          Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised
          mace.
                         
          Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the
          Cavernous space above.
                         
          To its tempo MING'S PERSONAL GUARDS now starts· appearing.
          They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing
          thing is that they all have the SAME FACE.
                         
          From left to right, back and front, the AMAZONS advance 0n
          FLASH and DALE. They do not attack, merely stun ad overwhelm
          us with their massive, silent, answerable threat.
                         
          FLASH swallows, looks this way and that, stands as if
          paralysed.
                         
                          DALE
           (low and tremulous)
           What's the play, Flash?
                         
                          FLASH
           I can't -- I just can't --
                         
                          DALE
           Can't what?
                         
                          FLASH
           Clobber a woman, Dale --
                         
                          DALE
                          (OUTBURST)
           You damn fool, those aren't women
           they're murderous AMAZON DYKES!
                         
          The AMAZONS are all around DALE now.
                         
                          DALE (CONT'D)
           Help!!
                         
          FLASH is paralyzed by indecision one beat more, then suddenly
          makes up his mind. He flies into action, SLAMS the nearest
          pair of AMAZONS.
           23.
                         
          INT. PALACE - FIGHT SEQUENCE
                         (DALE)
                         
          Fast and furious. Great havoc is wreaked by DALE and her
          karate, by FLASH and his flailing fists, but the AMAZONS'
          numerical superiority is of course decisive.
                         
          Soon FLASH is on the floor, pinioned by a dozen AMAZONS.
                         
          He looks up, with despairing eyes SEES poor DALE being dragged
          up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper
          gloom.
                         
                          DALE
           Flash!!
                         
          The pitiful shout sends FLASH'S adrenaline rushing. With a
          superhuman effort, he fights free from the pile-up and dashes
          after DALE.
                         
          INT. PALACE - ON THE STAIRCASE
                         
          FLASH struggles to get through to DALE.
                         
          DALE claws fiercely at the bare AMAZON arms and shoulders
          that engulf her, reaches desperately back down for FLASH.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT - THEIR HANDS
                         
          Just touching their fingertips.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT - A STEP OF THE STAIRS
                         
          Opens like a yawning trap door UNDER FLASH'S FEET.
                         
          FLASH drops away with a YELL, in the very instant that AURA
          comes running INTO THE SHOT and boldly JUMPS after him.
          AURA is swallowed up too, a split-second before the trap
          door step CLOSES again after them.
                         
          INT. PALACE - CU-MING
          (KLYTUS, MING)
                         
          Watching that, as KLYTUS hisses into his ear.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           She betrays you! She'll take him to
           Aboria!
                         
                          MING
           So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon
           for me -- I don't care.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           Don't be too sure!
           24.
                         
          MING glances at him, then back up the stairs at where DALE
          has vanished. His face softens, his tone turns museful!
                         
                          MING
           I haven't taken a wife in centuries.
           I could bring myself to marry this
           Dale Arden --
                          (A BEAT)
           What do you see in her future, Klytus?
                         
          NO reply. MING turns his head and finds that KLYTUS is gone.
          Vanished. Not particularly surprised or concerned, MING gazes
          again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own
          question with a licentious smile.
                         
          INT. A DARK METALLIC SHAFT - SHOOTING DOWN IT
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          It is seemingly endless, faintly lt by phosphoresence from
          below. We dimly make out the figures of FLASH and AURA falling
          away from us, far below, falling, falling. We HEAR Hollow
          echoing VOICES reverbrating up to us.
                         
                          AURA
           Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle
           after we hit the water -- I'll lead
           you!

           Hit what water?
                         
          In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH.
                         
          INT. UNDERWATER (TANK)
                         
          FLASH plummets down, AURA right after him. Recovering balance
          in a universe of bubbles, FLASH finds himself confronting an
          enormous savage LUMINOUS FISH. Wheeling himself away in
          fear and revulsion, FLASH encounters AURA. He seizes her
          ankle as directed. Holding his beat, FLASH swims after her
          through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern
          floor. AURA dives down, leads him OUT OF SIGHT through a low
          opening.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND GROTTO
          (AURA, FLASH, PLASH)
                         
          FLASH and AURA emerge from a pool of water. FLASH staggers
          across and collapses on a fringe of beach. For sure, AURA'S
          wet clinging robe doesn't make her look any less sexy. He
          stares at her.
                         
                          AURA
           Catch your breath -- then I'll take
           you up and find you a disguise.
           25.
                         
                          FLASH
           You're saving my life. How can I
           Thank you?
                         
                          AURA
           I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria -
           we'll find a way.
                         
                          FLASH
           Let's get one thing straight -- I've
           got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov
           too -- rescue them and try to save
           Earth too.
                         
                          AURA
           Do you realize how foolish you are
           to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter?
                         
                          FLASH
           I'm no good at lying.
                         
                          AURA
           You're funny -- are all Eathlings
           like you, Flash Gordon?
                         
                          PLASH
           I guess I'm about average.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          There are windows on one side, emitting a fierce GLARE. FLASH
          follows AURA rapidly along. Suddenly he stops short, looking
          in through the tinted glass.
                         
          WHAT HE SEES - PLASMA CAVERN
                         
          An infernal place, chief feature of which is a LAKE OF
          SEETHING MAGMA that slowly rotates within a wide encircling
          platform. The platform is piled with GLOWING RADIOACTIVE
          GRAVEL, being shoveled into the magma by LIZARDMAN SLAVES
          who toil in rythmic unison.
                         
           FLASH (O.S.)
           What's that?
                         
           AURA (O.S.)
           The plasma core. It's e source of
           the energy-beam my father ia aiming
           at Earth. You can't stop it. Ming is
           merciless and all-powerful!
                         
          ANGLES - LIZARDMAN SLAVES

          Showing ankle electrodes shackled to each SLAVE, so that
          those who collapse can be shocked back to their feet by GUARDS
          stationed on a surrounding catwalk above. Any SLAVE unable
          to rise is summarily pitched into the magma by HOODED MEN,
          waiting like executioners to perform this chore.
                         
           AURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           The slaves are Lizard Men. Once they
           had their own water Kingdom, the
           fairest of Mongo. Then they dared to
           rebel. They will suffer for it here
           forever.
                         
          FLASH looks at AURA again, then back in the window. He
          reacts.

          ZARKOV is being led along by SOLDIERS, heavily shackled. He
          stops, gazing in wonder at the seething lake, which FLARES
          UP BLINDINGLY with each shovel full of gravel.
                         
          FLASH and AURA
                         
                          AURA
           You can't reach him. If a soldier
           spots you, it's instant death! --
           Come!
                         
          AURA takes his hand. With one backward look toward ZARKOV
          who of course has not seen him, FLASH follows her.

           Incredible - the very core of this
           planet, is it not?
                         
                          SOLDIER
           We are but soldiers. We do not know.
                         
                          MING'S VOICE
           You guess well, Dr. Zarkov!
                         
          ZARKOV wheels in his chains, looks up.

          (EVERYONE, MING, ZARKOV)
                         
          High above this place where MING stands with KLYTUS, lit by
          the infernal glare as he goes on:
           27.
                         
                          MING
           I am forcing this plasma through the
           successive nuclear phases of a star -
           building it toward the apocalyptic
           moment that will end Earth's pathetic
           history in one flash of fire.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Devil! Why don't you turn this science
           to peaceful use? The name Ming would
           be blessed instead of cursed.
                         
                          MING
           Bring him up to the dome, Soldiers --
           we wish to show him wonders.
                         
          At that instant a couple of worn-out SLAVES are pitched into
          the magma. Their dying SCREAMS are drowned by the chorus
          from all the minions:
                         
                          EVERYONE
           Hail! Ming! Hail, Great one Without

          INT. UPPER PALACE AREA - CORRIDOR
          (AURA, FLASH)
                         
          AURA leads FLASH out through a doorway. He is now fitted out
          with a fairly resplendent MONGO costume: boots, cape,
          headdress and all. They hurry along through shadows. Suddenly
          FLASH seizes her by the shoulders, stops her.
                         
                          FLASH
           Listen, where's he got Dale?
                         
          As she looks at him, she SEES a detachment of SOLDIERS
          marching this direction. Quickly she pulls FLASH into a niche,
          presses her body against his in the narrow space. WHISPERS:
                         
                          AURA
           Forget Dale Arden!
                         
                          FLASH
           I can't! I mean I hardly know her,
                          BUT --
                         
                          AURA
           Forget her, Flash Gordon: I saw a
           look in my father's eye -- I think
           he intends to marry her.
                         
                          FLASH
           What?? Marry her? What are you
           talking about??
           28.
                         
          The SOLDIERS have gone past, but AURA is still pressing
          against him.
                         
                          AURA
           Oh you ask so many questions.
                          (SEDUCTIVE)
           I'm taking you to people who'll help
           you. Trust me!
                         
                          FLASH
           Can I honestly?
                         
                          AURA
           Trust me!
                         
          AURA hauls FLASH from the niche, they hurry on a bit further.
          AURA stops in front of big doors, with glass windows in them.
                         
                          AURA (CONT'D)
           Here we are.
                         
                          FLASH
           Here we are where?
                         
                          AURA
           I've dressed you as a Royal Pilot,
           First Class. We'll slip into my
           personal car and you'll fly it.
                         
          FLASH takes one look into the glass, then swivels back to
                         AURA
                         
                          FLASH
           Those are ROCKET SHIPS in there! I
           can't fly a damn rocket ship!
                         
                          AURA

           Learn from me -- I'll teach you so
           much!
                         
          INT. MING'S DOME
          (MING, ZARKOV)
                         
          Open at the top to space. But instead of our familiar pinpoint
          stars, here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity,
          their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are
          born and die.
                         
          ZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic
          devices on every side. Most prominent is a huge transparent
          cube, supported in the air above a control console. MING
          moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we HEAR a soft
          intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning
          on the top side of the dome.
           29.
                         
          An astonishing things happens. Inside the cube a recognisable
          greenish globe appears like a three-dimensional holograph,
          slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view
          below a veil of clouds.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Earth!
                         
                          MING
           Yes, Zarkov -- as it was. Now as it
           will be, when my plasma reaches full
           force.....
                         
          A sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN.
          ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys
          again.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           And as it will be in yet another
           time, long after you have died. Earth
           reborn! A pleasant image, no?
                         
          The fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty
          just as it was except that the outlines of our continents
          have been subtly changed.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           But that's impossible! Even your
           perverted genius can't create new
           life!
                         
                          MING
           Of course I can create life. There's
           nothing easier. It only requires
           myself and one woman.
                         
                          ZARKOV
                          (SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING)
           Dale Arden.....
                         
                          MING
           Who else? As in that childish myth
           of yours -- Adam and Eve, wasn't it?
           I will breed with her and repopulate
           the Earth in my own image. I've
           already done it on over a thousand
           planets.
                         
          MING touches a key. The image of Earth DISAPPEARS from the
          cube. ZARKOV glares hatred at MING for a beat, then his eye
          catches something else.
                         
          WHAT HE SEES
           30.
                         
          A big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded
          in it, just their hilts sticking out.
                         
          ANGLE to include ZARKOV. Chained as he is, he suddenly bounds
          over and seizes a sword hilt, tries to pull it out. It doesn't
          budge.
                         
                          MING (CONT'D)
           The magic blades are not for your
           kind, Zarkov. One is my own the other
           will only be withdrawn by my rightful
           heir. Pull on them with all your
                          MIGHT:
                         
          ZARKOV tugs desperately, but it doesn't give an inch. He
          falls panting over the block.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Monster!
                         
          MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER.
                         
                          MING
           Return him to the dungeon.
                         
          INT. MING'S SERAGLIO
          (DALE, HEDONIA)
                         
          DALE stands amongst the EXOTIC FEMALES of this lavish place,
          being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into
          a diaphanous gown. They intend her no harm. Though each has
          some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful.
                         
          Tickled, DALE can't suppress a giggle. The females are amazed
          and delighted by this phenomenon. They take turns poking at
          her ribs as tall HEDONIA glides up, bearing a flagon of green
          liquid.
                         
                          HEDONIA
           Drink this.
                         
          DALE recoils, her giggling cut short.
                         
                          DALE
           What is it -- some rotten drug?
                         
                          HEDONIA
           It has no name. But many brave men
           died to bring it across space from
           Cythera, planet of Pleasure. It
           will make your hours with Ming more
           agreeable.
                         
          With a karate chop, DALE- knocks the flagon away. HEDONIA
          rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry.
           31.
                         
                          HEDONIA (CONT'D)
           We are of different race, Dale Arden
           but we all are women here. I know
           your fears. Believe me, it will be
           better if you drink it...
                         
          HEDONIA retrieves the flagon from the silken pillow where it
          landed, extends it again to DALE. A shout!
                         
                          DALE
           Flash! Where are you??
                         
          Of course there is no answer. Sudden tears of despair spring
          from DALE'S eyes. She seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks
          it. Her expression changes.
                         
                          DALE (CONT'D)

          then reaches up and pulls down a curious gadget hanging above

          inside, not totally unlike a beauty-shop hairdryer.

          like iron. The surface of Ardentia LOOMS UP , closer and

          DALE is immersed naked in a bubbly swirling tub, a luxuriant
          prisoner of the FEMALES who bathe and groom her. She seems
          dazed by steam and by the sensuous movement of the water.
           34.
                         
          A couple of the FEMALES lift DALE'S hands, make a cup of
          them. HEDONIA pours rich oil into it.
                         
                          HEDONIA
           Rub this on your body. It gives
           Ming pleasure.
                         
          DALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and
          LAUGH softly. Suddenly a FILTERED VOICE is HEARD from nowhere,
          though it seems very close:

          swinging HALT, so Suddenly that FLASH and AURA almost have
          their wind knocked out as they are thrown against their seat

          It hangs snagged in a huge vine, like a creature caught by
          some monstrous boa-constrictor. This is a complete world of
          green, the light, the feeling of the air. Everything rings
          with forest SOUNDS. The very sky is shut from view by leaves
          and foliage.
                         
          The craft's hatch opens. FLASH struggles out, gives AURA a
          hand up. Kneeling on the cabin, FLASH takes in this incredible
          vista stretching all around.

          Ultra-Byzantine splendor. The only light is by a huge bed
          on which DALE reclines. A SERVING GIRL glides up with a
          flagon of that liquid.
                         
                          SERVING GIRL

           No, thanks. Just turn down the light
           a bit, would you? I'm shy.
                         
          The SERVING GIRL leans over the bed to do so. We GLIMPSE

          MING sits, extends a hand. His FINGERS travel sensuously up
          a BARE THIGH, suddenly stop.
                         
          Savagely, MING pulls the face of the GIRL into the light. It
          is not DALE ARDEN but the unconscious SERVING GIRL, now
          dressed in DALE'S gown.

          hand touches his shoulder.
                         
          ZARKOV wakes with a start to SEE a SERVING GIRL bending over
          him, tray in hand. She moves her cloak to reveal that she is
          DALE.
                         
          A GUARD stands nearby against a wall, faceless in the shadow
          of a cowled uniform.
                         
                          GUARD
           Serving Girl - what business have
           you in this dungeon?
                         
          DALE quickly puts the tray down, stands and turns to the
          GUARD She smiles invitingly, lifts her skirt up above her
          knee.
                         
          The legs are long and terrific.
           39.
                         
          The GUARD catches his breath, steps toward her lecherously
          to accept the invitation. WHAM! He doubles up as DALE kicks
          him in the groin, goes down without a sound as a left-right-
          left series of KARATE CHOPS hits his neck.
                         
          He is hardly on the floor before DALE is pouncing on the key-
          ring at his belt.

          and cocking his weapon.
                         
          The stricken LION MAN comes INTO VIEW. Incredibly, the glass
          arrow in his back has transformed him into a STATUE OF ICE.
          At BARIN'S footfall, he DISINTEGRATES in a tinkling fall of
          frozen shards.
                         
          THE TIGER MAN is poised behind a tree near the lodge, panting.
          He is a magnificent creature, with a horn sticking out of
          his forehead. He tenses, HEARING the BIRDLIKE CALLS of the
          advancing hunters. Closer, closer.

          crouching pair look in appeal to the TIGER MAN by the tree.
          He watches a beat, waves them to run backward, then covering
          the escape of the others, TIGER MAN charges into his enemies
          headlong.

           It's the risk I ask, Barin hide him

                          BARIN
           I'll hide him, all right -- under

          BARIN hesitates, provoked by that, then shouts:

          basket, pulls off the lid. A hideous EEL-LIKE SERPANT rears
          it's head, HISSING and SNAPPING venemously. The KEEPER sticks
          his arm down. The snake coils around it. With a drooling
          grin, the KEEPER withdraws it.

          KEEPER carries the hissing snapping snake toward an enormous
          STUMP of a tree trunk. He holds his arm out over it, WHISTLES
          a curious note. The snake leaps off the arm and VANISHES
          into the hollowed out trunk. We notice now that there are
          SIX HOLES drilled into the gnarled wood.

          he goes to the stump and plunges a hand INTO one of the holes.

          He pulls out his hand and staggers backward. BARIN plunges
          his sword into the man's breast and he topples over the
          parapet, dead. Sword in hand, BARIN turns to FLASH.

          BARIN'S sword touches FLASH'S back.
                         
          He walks to the stump. Every eye is on him, every breath
          held.
                         
          With a sudden quick motion, FLASH plunges his hand into a

          AURA laughs softly. BARIN strides across, plunges his hand
          into another hole, rips it out again unscathed. He whirls to
          FLASH, points the sword at him.

          The point touches FLASH again. Just two holes left. He does
          a silently mouthed eeny-meeny-miney-mo between them, plunges
          his hand into one.

          As FLASH whips his arm out again. Amazingly, he has hold of
          the terrible serpent, grasping it just below the head. CRIES
          from the astounded TREE MEN, and then FLASH is leaping INTO
          ACTION.

          Whirling, FLASH swings the hissing snapping writhing beast
          at the nearest TREEMEN, scattering them, and thrusts the
          serpent's head at BARIN.
                         
          BARIN slashes with his sword, misses. The serpent's tail
          coils around the blade, rips it from BARIN'S hand as the
          Prince of Arboria dives backwards.
                         
          FLASH whirls again, SLAMS the serpent's head into a post,
          and SNATCHES the sword from the tail before it hits the floor.

          He dashes for the ramp to the ground.. The TIGER MAN is right
          in front of him, struggling in the net. FLASH pauses, SLASHES
          at the cords. TIGER MAN is freed, bounds to his feet with a
          ROAR, clobbers a pair of TREE MEN just jumping on him and
          FLASH. Snatching one's CROSSBOW and QUIVER OF GLASS ARROWS,
          he races down the ramp behind FLASH.

           The sight -- call came from the left!
                         
          TREE MA.i. The sight-call carne from the left:
                         
                          BARIN
           Up and across we'll cut them off!
                         
          He BLOWS his horn again. The TREE MEN start moving quickly
          some climbing, others SWINGING laterally on vines.
                         
          IN THE BASKET
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
                         
          Rising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is
          changing, becoming less intensely green.
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           What is that color above?
                         
                          FLASH
           Blue. We call is blue.
                         
          A DOZEN TREE MEN come swinging into view on vines, land on a
          fat branch. The LEADER looks right in this direction, points
          and gives a chilling BIRDCALL. The TREE MEN unsling their
          crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS.
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN
           50.
                         
          SEEING cold death staring them in the face.
                         
          FLASH reaches for an arrow, notches it.
                         
           TREE MAN LEADER
           You haven't a chance! Throw down
           your weapon!
                         
          FLASH makes like to throw his crossbow away. At the last
          instant, h swings it around, aims and FIRES.
                         
          TREE MEN ON BRANCH
                         
          Are startled as the arrow WHIRRS in and sticks into the branch
          under their feet. The branch instantly turns to ICE.
                         
          BARIN - CLIMBING FROM BELOW
                         
          HEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND. He looks up, gapes,
          holds on tight to the tree trunk. A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN
          plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through
          the branches to doom. A look of fierce delight on his face,
          BARIN resumes his climb.
                         
          EXT. TREETOPS OF ARBORIA
          (FLASH, TIGER MAN)
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf,
          near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around
          a great iron wheel. The forest is open to the sky at this
          altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers. Enormous
          overlapping leaves form a floor FLASH and TIGER MAN can stand
          on.
                         
                          FLASH
           Which way to the border:
                         
                          TIGER MAN
           Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean
           to the west.
                         
          FLASH quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the
          shadows, starts in the direction he estimates is west.
                         
          TREETOPS OF ARBORIA - OTHER ANGLES
                         
          FLASH and TIGER MAN running over the leaves, which are
          somewhat BOUNCY like a huge trampoline. It's quite enjoyable.
          FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off
          the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next.
                         
          Amazingly, a fat TENDRIL seizes him in mid-air, coils around
          his waist. FLASH yells as he is lifted further up.
                         
          AN ENORMOUS FLOWER
           51.
                         
          is right above him. The closed petals open. The inside is
          viscous, hideous looking. In the deepest recess is a dark
          red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND.
          With horror, FLASH realizes the tendril is feeding him into
          the flower's maw.
                         
          PLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength. TIGER
          MAN dashes to his rescue below, but another tendril knocks
          him flat.
                         
          INT. FLOWER
          (BARIN, FLASH)
                         
          FLASH is conveyed INTO the flower. He punches wildly with
          his fists, kicks, but petals are CLOSING inexorably around
          him. On their inner surface are deadly spiny SPIKES.
          Scattered around are the crushed SKELETONS of luckless TREE
          MEN who have been fed in here.
                         
          SWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying
          past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart. The
          flower SHRIEKS. All around, FLASH, it is turning into
          crystalline ICE.
                         
          The tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below
          beside the TIGER MAN.
                         
          TREETOPS - ANOTHER ANGLE
                         
          As FLASH turns his head to see BARIN standing with his
          crossbow on a leaf some twenty feet away.
                         
                          BARIN
           I saved you because your death must
           be mine.
                         
                          FLASH
           What's the point of all this killing?
           Why don't we team up and overthrow
           Ming?
                         
          BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure
          raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart. Suddenly a SHADOW covers
          BARIN. He jerks his head up to SEE:
                         
          A WINGED SILHOUETTE
                         
          Diving from the sun at him. It is a HAWKMAN, magnificiently
          fierce. It seizes BARIN in its talons and lifts him INTO THE
          AIR.
                         
                         OTHER HAWKMEN
                         
          Hover, their wings beating the air. They dive on FLASH and
          TIGER MAN, lift them too.
           52.

          Put the binoculars down, with one hand lowers the THOUGHT
          TRANSFER hood over her head, with the other waves the craft
          into a sharp turn away from the HAWKMEN. Without her lips
                         MOVING:

           Princess Aura returns to Mingo City
           The passage through the force-field
           opens at her approach --
                         
          AURA twists the tuning dial, then goes on in a soft
                         PROVOCATIVE TONE:

          They are inside, she watching tensely as ZARKQV throws
          switches and eyes displays.
                         
                          DALE
           Will it fly?

           What happened?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Heaven knows. I was just starting to
           test the primary transformer-banks
                          AND ----
                         
          ZARKOV stops abruptly, looking down at himself. DALE gasps.
                         
                          DALE
           My God -- your hands! Your hands
           are gone!
                         
          It is true: ZARKOV has no hands.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Not gone -- Just invisible. See?
                         
          INVISIBLE HANDS pick up a pebble from the ground, hold it
          before DALE'S nose. Magically, they toss the little object
          back and forth from one UNSEEN HAND to the other. DALE touches
          one, can feel it.
                         
                          DALE
           Does it hurt?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Not a bit. I believe Mongo's
           gravitational. field must have
           reversed the polarity of my generator
           so that --
                         
          He breaks off again. Slowly, in front of our eyes, ZARKOV'S
          HANDS are FADING IN, again and becoming VISIBLE. DALE whistles
          in amazement.
                         
                          ZARKOV (CONT'D)
           Neat trick. I wonder if it's
           controllable?
                         
          SHADOW over them suddenly. Great WHIRRING of wings. DALE
          Looks up and SCREAMS.

          KLYTUS smiles that sinister way. MING looks at him
          questioningly.

          beard cloven by an old scar from forehead to jaw. Gorgeous
          HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very
          closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom. DALE
          slaps his hand away.
                         
                          DALE
           Watch out, you old bird -- Ming wants
           to marry me.
                         
          VULTAN hoots at that as HAWKGIRLS murmur. He's about to
          touch her again when there is a CLAMOR o.s. VULTAN reacts.

          HAWKMEN carrying FLASH, TIGER MAN and BARIN swoop OUT from
          another hole like the one they dove into. The whole place is
          like a great hanging birdhouse, HAWKWOMEN and HAWCHILDREN
          moving in and out and perching on the various exterior
          terraces.

           Ho! -- Barin! - I knew my Hawkmen
           would catch you one of these days.
                         
                          SARIN
           Be careful how you address me, Vultan.
           I am Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria.
                         
                          VULTAN
           Not in my Kingdom -- here you're
           just a stray animal to be killed for
           our sport!

                          BARIN
           Yes -- I would hunt you down and

          Sudden ear-piercing SCREAM from above. DALE'S scream, FLASH
          bounds to his feet.
                         
          IN THE EYRIE
                         
          DALE is surrounded by jealous HAWKGIRLS who are pushing her
          toward the terrace edge. Screaming again, DALE goes OVER.

          He hauls her in and they embrace in a steamy kiss. FLUTTER
          of wings. HAWKMEN swoop at the terrace and LIFT UP the
          clinging couple. It barely interrupts their conversation:

          In the same instant, FLASH dives onto his side amidst the
          deadly knives and grabs at BARIN'S wrist.
           62.
                         
          FLASH catches him. BARIN hangs suspended over the abyss of
          space held only by FLASH'S grip.
                         
                          VULTAN
           You've won, Earthling! Drop him to
           doom!
                         
                          FLASH
           (gasping at BARIN)
           Try to catch my wrist! -- the other
           one.
                         
                          VULTAN
           What is this??
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Call it what you want, Vultan --
           compassion -- mercy: let us teach
           you the meaning of these words.
                         
                          FLASH

           get a leg up here!
                         
          Suddenly an ECHOING VOICE BOOMS from the sky:
                         
                          MING'S VOICE
           Vultan! Hear Ming, Ruler of the
           Universe!
                         
          INT. MING'S DOME

          Where MING watches the SKY PALACE SCENE on a viewing screen,
          a weeping AURA beside him, as he goes on:
                         
                          MING
           I see you, Vultan -- and Barin too!
           You both have defied we by sparing
           these Earthlings!
                         
                          AURA
           Barin -- my only -- I swear I didn't
           mean to get you into this!
                         
                         FEATURE VULTAN
                         
          As the VOICE goes on:
                         
                          MING'S VOICE
           Do you want to live, Vultan?
                         
                          VULTAN
           What creature wants to die?
           63.
                         
                          MING'S VOICE
           Then kill Flash Gordon now! Pick up
           Dale Arden, deliver her to me on
           your own wings -- it's your only
           chance! My fleet is already in the
           air, ready to destroy your whole
           Kingdom if you disobey!
                         
          The ECHO rolls and dies.
                         
                         DISC
                         
          TIGER MAN suddenly leaps out onto the disc, slides over
          between the knives, helps FLASH pull BARIN up to safety.
                         
                         AS BEFORE
                         
          ZARKOV in his chains, walks over to the confused VULTAN...
                         QUIETLY:
                         
                          ZARKOV
           What'll you have -- death or dishonor?
                         
          VULTAN looks down at FLASH once more, then makes up his mind.
          He shouts to his people:
                         
                          VULTAN
           We'll save these Earthlings! - Curse
           Ming! -- Into the air, my Hawkpeople -
           fly!
                         
          ZARKOV grins, extends a hand to VULTAN. He just looks at
          it.
                         
                          VULTAN (CONT'D)
           I don't understand this. I think
           I've gone mad.
                         
          INT. MING'S DOME
          (AURA, MING)
                         
          MING snaps off the viewing screen, looks at AURA
                         
                          AURA
           Spare him Daddy -- oh please spare
                          BARIN --
                         
          AURA tries to throw herself into his arm, but he pushes her
          roughly away.
                         
          KLYTUS materialises from a shadow, smiling.
                         
                          MING
           You've always wanted her, Klytus --
           Aura is yours.

          EXT. SKY PALACE - LONG SHOT
                         
          It is being evacuated. Squadrons of HAWAKPEOPLE stream out
          of its many openings, diminutive figures against the sky.
                         
          ANOTHER PART OF THE SKY
                         
          Several ROCKET-SHIPS appear, wonderfully gaudy contraptions
          with MING's battle-flags flying. A RAY shoots out from the
          nose of the biggest.
                         
          EXT. SKY PALACE - LONG SHOT
                         
          The RAY zaps it. The whole place EXPLODES.

          (DALE, FLASH, VULTAN, ZARKOV)
                         
          VULTAN and his CAPTAIN lead. Ranged around are BARIN, FLASH,
          DALE ,TIGER MAN and ZARKOV, each carried by a HAWKMAN. Distant
          explosions rumble like thunder.
                         
                          VULTAN
           Don't look back, Hawkman. Head for
           that cloud-cover!
           (over his shoulder)
           Where's this capsule of yours,
           exactly?
                         
                          ZARKOV
           In the high grass east of Mingo.
                         
                          VULTAN
           Pick it up, Captain!
                         
          The CAPTAIN and a FEW HAWKMEN peel off.
                         
          FLASH and DALE
                         
          Gaze at each other lovingly, flown along about a hundred
          feet apart. He calls for her:
                         
                          FLASH
           Guess the first thing you and me are
           gonna do after we land..!
                         
                          DALE
           Darling not in front of the Hawkmen --
           you'll make me blush! --
                         
                          FLASH
           Gonna do it first thing -- around
           here, never know if you'll get another
           chance!

          Dark SHADOW falls over DALE. She looks up.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE IN THE SKY
                         
          A big ROCKET SHIP hovers, doors in its bottom side opening.
          A flickering RAY shoots down.

          As an effulgent GLOW envelopes her. Inexorably, DALE and
          her HAWKMEN are sucked upward.
                         
                          DALE
           Help!!

           (to his Hawkmen)
           Follow her -- climb!
                         
          VULTAN's command of course takes precedence. The HAWKMAN
          bearing FLASH follows his mates into a shrieking vertical.
          dive.

          DALE and her HAWKMAN are sucked up into a chamber. Waiting
          SOLDIERS seize the struggling HAWKMAN, brutally smash his
          wings pitch him OUT the bottom as the doors close.
                         
          DALE backs off, drops into a karate stance, With a WHINING
          ROAR the craft accelerates throwing DALE off balance against
          a wall. HEDONIA enters through a door, her arms full seems
          to be yards and yards of filmy white material. HEDONIA Smiles
          nicely.
                         
                          HEDONIA
           Time is short. Ming sent me to fit
           you with is.
                         
                          DALE
           Fit me with what?

          TREE MEN and LION MEN and TIGER MAN toil together in peaceful

          Several hovering HAWKMEN hold it in position with vine cables
          as the work is completed. Capsule door is open. Through it
          we see ZARKOV at work inside, feverishly re-wiring a control

          Up on Lodge Balcony, FLASH, BARIN and VULTAN lean over a
          table on which maps and drawings are laid out, a typical
          military staff meeting. With a bit of charcoal, BARIN sketches
          a semi-circular line over a map of MING'S city.
                         
                          BARIN
           A force-field covers the whole city,
           from here to here. With luck, Flash
           can lure them into lowering their
           defenses.
                         
                          VULTAN
           What if he fails?
                          (ABRUPTLY)
           This is suicide, Barin! I can't
           order my men to suicide!
                         
          VULTAN ascends into the air. Hovers as he goes on:
                         
                          VULTAN (CONT'D)
           The flight brought me back to my

           Look -- he still casts a shadow:
                         
          It's true. FLASH is totally invisible, but on the ground we
          SEE his shadow as he climbs out and stands upright.
                         
          Suddenly there is rising WHINING HUMMING SOUND that seems to
          fill the whole firmament. The earth trembles. LION MEN and
          TREE MEN cower in terror. TIGER MAN roars.

          CUTS AND ANGLES - UPWARDS
                         
          The topless forest of Arboria is withering, falling apart.
          TREE MEN cry with primal fear as the SEE the sky revealed.
                         
          Hovering against the sun are the dark shapes of MING'S ROCKET
          SHIPS. PULSING RAYS emanate from projectors on their bottoms.
          A VOICE booms from heave:
                         
                          VOICE
           Prisoners of Ming, you are surrounded!
           The creature who moves is obliterated!

          ONE LION MAN
                         
          Howls in terror, makes a break for cover. A RAY instantly
          zaps down at him and he EXPLODES into fiery fragments.
                         
          BACK TO MAIN PART OF FOREST
                         
          A small SHUTTLE CRAFT descends vertically to a soft landing.
          KLYTUS gets out. Every sound ceases. He nods at BARIN, at
          ZARKOV. Looks around. Frowns. He walks directly across
          FLASH'S SHADOW, to ZARKOV.
                         
                          KLYTUS

          DALE shuts her eyes, sobs out:
                         
                          DALE
           Oh Flash -- no -- you can't be dead --
           it doesn't make any sense --

           I don't believe you. You -- you

          Tear runs down AURA'S cheeks. She seizes DALE'S hand, presses
          it against her wonderful breast. DALE is really moved.
                         
                          DALE

           Ming tired of her. He blew my Mother
           into outer space. I look into the
           night sky sometimes and wonder what
           star she's orbiting --

           God, Aura -- no wonder you've had
           problems -- that bastard:
                         
          DALE embraces AURA. They cling to each other, bosom against

           With this ring, I thee wed!
                         
          An INVISIBLE HAND snatches the ring from MING'S grip like
          lightning and james it onto DALE'S finger.
                         
                          DALE
           Flash!!!
                         
                          FLASH'S VOICE
           Run!!!
                         
                         HIGH ANGLE
           81.
                         
          Pandemonium. DALE runs like hell, but is tripped by her train
          and goes down as MING leaps up onto his throne platform.
                         
                          MING
           Seal this hall! Close every portal!
                         
          ANGLE - A PORTAL
                         
          Swinging shut, BARIN squeezing in through it at the last
          instant, sword in hand. KLYTUS rushes at him with a sword of
          his own.
                         
                         MING
                         
          Looks around wildly, whipping out the sword sheathed at his
          belt. Its blade is like crystal fire. He reacts sharply,
          catches his breath.
                         
          WHAT MING SEES - ANOTHER SWORD
          (FLASH'S VOICE, MING)
                         
          exactly like his, a blade of fire, apparently hanging in the
          air and pointed right at him.
                         
                          MING
           Where did you get that sword?
                         
                          FLASH'S VOICE
           From the crystal block.
                         
                          MING
           Impossible! It could only be pulled
           by my rightful heir!
                         
                          FLASH'S VOICE
           How about that?
                         
          The sword slowly advances.
                         
                         FEATURE MING
                         
          His face contorted, he flies at INVISIBLE FLASH behind the
          sword. FLASH parries the blow. Astonishing pyrotechnics as
          the blades hit each other. Shrieking MONGONS flee under
          showers of fire.
                         
          INT. PLASMA CAVERN
                         (ZARKOV)
                         
          HAWKMEN and LIZARD MEN SLAVES engage MING'S PEOPLE.
                         
          Aided by VULTAN and TIGER MAN, ZARKOV battles his way up to
          the Mezzanine Control area. He shouts down wildly:
           82.
                         
                          ZARKOV
           Attach the electrodes to the shovels!
           Pitch them into the plasma!
                         
          INT. GREAT HALL
          (BARIN, DALE, KLYTUS)
                         
          MING and FLASH
                         
          Duel dazzlingly around the enormous throne. Suddenly FLASH
          starts to lose his invisibility. A pair of eyes appears,
          the tip of a nose, parts of limbs.
                         
                         CU DALE
                         
          Pinned by AMAZONS, reacting to that.
                         
                          DALE
           Flash -- look out -- you're coming
           back! He can see you now, Flash!
                         
          FLASH and MING
                         
          FLASH pauses to look at himself, almost gets his head lopped
          off by a fiery slash from MING, recovers to bound up higher
          on the vast throne statue wheron they battle.
                         
          PULL UP. In the f.g. the image of EARTH slowly turns and
          glows redder with the lightning inside the clouds.
                         
          BARIN and KLYTUS
                         
          Duel in another area of e Hall. A thrust by BARIN catches
          KLYTUS on the forehead. KLYTUS springs back, blood gushing
          down over his eyes.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           I foresaw at blow --
                         
                          BARIN
           You're blinded, Klytus -- drop your
           sword!
                         
          KLYTUS laughs, reaches up and throws off his helmet, WHIRLS
          in a lightning way to reveal
                         
                         ANOTHER FACE
                         
          Shadowed, hideous, marked with all the evil in the universe.
          It's mouth emits a raging SCREAM.
                         
                         BARIN
                         
          Lunges with horror, slashes with his sword point.
           83.
                         
                         KLYTUS'S CHEEK
                         
          Is slashed but grotesquely does not bleed.
                         
          BARIN and KLYTUS
                         
          Fly at each other again, trade blows, then each catches a
          wrist of the other with his free hand. KLYTUS laughs
          horribly.
                         
                          KLYTUS
           You fight me in vain, Barin I do not
           foresee my death at your hands --
                         
          KLYTUS twists away, knocks BARIN'S sword out of his grasp,
          drives BARIN back against the wall. KLYTUS lifts his own
          sword, puts it at BARIN'S throat for the final thrust.
                         
                         KLYTUS'S FACE
                         
          Suddenly changes horribly. PULL BACK. AURA is behind him,
          her hand on the hilt of BARIN'S sword, which she has driven
          into KLYTUS' back. Soundless, dead, KLYTUS falls to the floor.
                         
          AURA and BARIN
                         
          Move together, embrace. BARIN touches her face. Gently, AURA
          strokes BARIN'S cheek in hirst human-like, loving touch.
                         
          FLASH and MING
                         
          Have duelled their way right up onto the shoulder of the
          great statue now, fight against a vast replica of MING'S
          EAR.

          ANGLE DOWN to ZARKOV at console, protected against the final
          GUARDS' onslaught by VULTAN and TIGER MAN as he works
          feverishly with a screwdriver on a wiring panel pulled out
          from the innards He straightens up, takes a deep breath.
                         
                          ZARKOV

          As he swivels his head for a quick look. He freezes, gives
          a CRY of unmitigated rage. FLASH seizes the instant, thrust
          his sword.
                         
          The blade goes into MING up to the hilt. FLASH pulls it
          out.
                         
          There isn't a drop of blood. MING just stands there , smoking,
          in spectacular fashion into the atoms of which he was
          constituted. MING is just GONE.

          EVERYONE looks upwards at FLASH, standing with his sword
          atop the statue. There is a clatter as AMAZONS cast away
          their spears. A cry goes up as if from one throat!

          together, looking up at the terrific sky-shadow, FLASH with
          an arm around DALE'S shoulder. He glances at her tenderly,
          is surprised to see tears on her cheeks.

		NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

				by Lewis Abernathy


	FADE IN:

	EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

	MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
	Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
	The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(in chorus)
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
	lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
	Elm Street 1 & 2).

	Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
	house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
	children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
	and jumprope on the front walk.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Three... four... better lock your
		door.

	Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
	"4" drawn on concrete.

	Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
	from Nightmare 3 & 4).

	Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
	little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
	peeling away.

	Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
	it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
	porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Five... six...

	RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

	The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
	we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
	find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
	nighttime.

	The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
	stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
	back to the little girl.

	But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
	remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
	and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
	it into the...


	INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
	cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
	Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
	tries to open it -- locked.

	Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
	trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
	GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy?

	Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
	following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
	belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
	end of the hallway, moving into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

	On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
	old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
	draws with crayons.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy. What are you doing here?

				LIZZY
		Playing with my friend.

	Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
	of Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		Your friend?

				LIZZY
		He lives under the bed.

	Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
	Lizzy's bed.

	Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
	the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
	the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
	tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		You scared him...

	Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

				MEAGAN
		I scared him?

	But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Lizzy?

	Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
	in the...


	INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
	a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
	goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
	-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
	all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
	down.

	The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
	Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

	Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

				FREDDY
		Where ya been all my death, baby?

	Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
	tuxedo, crooning:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've been waitin' at the altar for
		a long, long time!

	Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
	spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
	filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
	of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
	asks:

				SATANIC PRIEST
		Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

	Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
	dressed in body bags.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		And the groomsmen...?

	Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
	trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		If anyone here believes that these
		two should not be joined in unholy
		matrimony, let him speak now or
		forever rot in hell...

	>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

				JESSE
		Meagan!

	Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
	in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
	outstretched.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
	encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
	eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

	It's Jason.

	Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
	it down between her eyes...

						TRANSITION CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
	was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
	dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
	on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
	a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
	with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
	she notices something not quite right about the doll.
	She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
	a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy...

	Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

				FREDDY DOLL
		Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

	The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
	thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

	Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
	She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
	Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
	dream.

	ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
	with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
	pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
	out of bed...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
	her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
	tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
	glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
	head.

				MEAGAN
		Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
		up.

	Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
	then frowns.

				LIZZY
		I had a bad dream.

				MEAGAN
		Me, too.

				LIZZY
		I was scared.

				MEAGAN
		Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

				LIZZY
		Promise?

				MEAGAN
		Promise.

	Lizzy hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		I'll never let anyone hurt you.


	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
	A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
	SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
	NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
	the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
	surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
	house.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(filtered)
		As the sun rises on yet another
		morning, still no end in sight for
		the standoff between police and the
		mysterious group known only as the
		"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
		house behind me just thirteen days
		ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
		away teenagers -- have managed to
		keep police at bay for almost two
		weeks while inside they take mind-
		altering narcotics in order to
		communicate with their god --
		Freddy.

	The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
	where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
	down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
	who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
	herself a cup and sits.

				MEAGAN
		Morning.

	Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
	looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
	just a little too cheerfully:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Morning, Meagan.

	Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
	father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
	Meagan's mom bellows:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
			(calls upstairs)
		Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
		is almost ready!

	Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
	into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

	ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

				NEWS REPORTER
		Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
		was released on a legal technicality
		but later burned to death at the
		hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
		parents.  Some years later, a rash
		of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
		age deaths began leaving many in
		the area to wonder... is Freddy
		really dead?

	Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
	breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
	pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
	family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
	Tart, whining.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Hurry up and eat. You don't want
		to be late for special school.

				MEAGAN
		Mom! Don't call it that!

				LIZZY
		I hate that school. The other kids
		are mean... and they're all re-
		tard-ed!

	Meagan snickers.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We don't use that word. They're
		"special" children just like you're
		"special".

	Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
	Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
	the paper.

	ANGLE ON TV --

				NEWS REPORTER
		The cult members have declined to
		an on-camera interview but did send
		out a note with a message. The note
		-- which, by the way, appears to
		have been written in blood -- reads...
			(reads the note)
		To the parents of Springwood --
		Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
		take one of your children as his
		virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
		and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
		-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
		shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
		to rise and rule the darkness forever
		and ever.

	A horn TOOTS outside.

				MEAGAN
		That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

	Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
	dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Oh, look at the time! I've got to
		be going... anyone need me to bring
		anything home tonight?

				MEAGAN
		I need an alarm clock.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		What's wrong with your old one?

				MEAGAN
		Broke.

	Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
	door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're almost out of vodka.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

				JESSE
		Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

				MEAGAN
		My mom...

				JESSE
		And...?

				MEAGAN
		I had another dream last night...

				JESSE
		Was I naked?

				MEAGAN
		No. You were Jason.

				JESSE
		Jason? Oh, yeech...
			(then)
		Was I any good?

	Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


	INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
	his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
	say something.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Do you have to watch that crap all
		the time? Months and months of the
		O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

	Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
	slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
	then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
	into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
	switches the set back on.

	CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
	RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

				NEWS REPORTER
		I'm standing here with State Trooper
		Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
		Governor has called in to deal with
		the cultists because of his past
		experience with occult-style
		murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
		is the only law enforcement officer
		ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
		with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
		killer -- Jason Voorhees.
			(to Murdoch)
		You received some pretty nasty
		injuries in your battle with Jason,
		didn't you, Captain?

				MURDOCH
		Nothing serious... just a few
		stitches.

				NEWS REPORTER
		What about these so called "Freddy"
		cultists? They seem like pretty
		tough customers. Think you'll have
		any trouble getting them out of
		there?

				MURDOCH
		No. Now that the Governor has given
		me complete authority to deal with
		these punks I should be putting an
		end to their situation pretty quick.
		Unless of course their attorney is
		able to get them to come out peace-
		fully... but I don't hold out much
		hope for that.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(to camera)
		Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
		gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
		criminals.

	EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
	to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

				MURDOCH
		Damn media... oughtta be a law.
			(gestures to house)
		Is that shyster still in there
		trying to talk them out?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... he's making them some kind
		of deal.

				MURDOCH
		Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
		assholes. Shakespeare was right --
		kill all the lawyers. Then we could
		kill all the punks with no hassles
		and the world would be a safer place.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Smaller anyway.

				MURDOCH
		Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
		Long-haired, English freak. He was
		probably a punk.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

	Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
	is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
	He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
	punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
	They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
	flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
	disfigured faces.

	The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
	takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
	neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
	his nose nervously as he speaks:

				SLEAZY LAWYER
		So, as I explained to you before,
		the revenues between the TV movie
		deal and the book sale should be
		adequate to fund your joint-defense.
		And I think with my mass media
		hypnosis argument I could get each
		of you a reduced sentence on appeal
		-- say... twenty years each. Out
		in fifteen with good behavior?
		Hmmmmm?

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
	an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
	windshield with a loud SPLAT!

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Jesus Christ!

	Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
	the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
	.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
	the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
	SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

	The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
	of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
	S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
	with foil, the walls have been painted black with
	cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
	black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
	night vision goggles and starts moving through the
	house.

	P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
	team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
	the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
	light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
	face.

	Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
	team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
	guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
	opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
	a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
	starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
	a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
	his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
	have been shredded to the bone.

	Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
	steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
	swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
	His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
	gun.

	The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
	bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
	the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
	room behind them.

	CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
	covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
	both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
	The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
	barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
	the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

	Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
	He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
	cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
	the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

				MURDOCH
		Freeze!

	Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

	The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
	retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
	cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
	guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
	thunder down a back staircase to the...


	INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
	house and most escape through the underground tunnel
	just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
	the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
	is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
	S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hold your fire!

	He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
	flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
	smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
	to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
	-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
	ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Help me, mister... please.

	The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
	down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
	tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
	timer.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hang on, honey... I'll have you
		out of there in a second.

	Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
	passageway and says:

				MURDOCH
		Looks like we'll have to hunt the
		rest of them down. Let's go before
		they get too far.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		We can't leave! Can't you see
		we've got a situation here?

	Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

				MURDOCH
		Leave her.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You're crazy! I can't just leave
		her!

				MURDOCH
		Forget it. I've seen this before.
		There's nothing you can do.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I've got to try...

	The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
	to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
	23... 22...

	The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
	of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
	team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

				MURDOCH
		You're wasting your time.

	The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
	second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
	13...

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Fuck it!

	The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
	and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
	in his arms as he shouts to his men:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing; yelling)
		CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

	The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
	bringing up the rear.


	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
	girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
	and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
	the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
	-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

	Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
	mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks.

	As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
	the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Are you okay, honey?

	Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
	commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Freddy lives!

	With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
	commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
	his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
	He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
	takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
	style.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		NO!

	The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
	time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
	dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing)
		Jesus... you were going to kill
		that kid, weren't you?

				MURDOCH
		I told you you were wasting your
		time. Once these kids go rabid,
		best thing to do is put 'em down.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You can't be serious...

				MURDOCH
		Dead serious. See... the world is
		made up of rules. Kids don't like
		rules. They rebel for a while, but
		ultimately they start to fall in
		line and become ordinary Joe's like
		you and me. But some kids... dope
		smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
		Satanic lyrics melting what's left
		of their brains... these kids grow
		up to be punks. And when these punks
		step as far over the line as these
		"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
		peace officers have no choice but
		to kill them.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I didn't become a peace officer to
		kill kids.

				MURDOCH
		Punks. There's a difference...
			(under his breath)
		...barely.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
	LIVES!

	We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
	it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
	instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

				MISS KREPPS
		(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

	It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
	struggling to stay awake while others have already
	passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
	She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
	in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
	fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
	on:

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

	Meagan starts to drift off, when...

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing; loud)
		Meagan!?

				MEAGAN
		Yes, ma'am?

				MISS KREPPS
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your oral report?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I'm ready.

				MISS KREPPS
		Please come up here to the podium.

	Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
	snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
	snaps her fingers for quiet.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		You won't think it's funny when
		you haven't learned the fundamentals
		of a free market economy... oh,
		why do I waste my breath? You're
		all going to grow up to be gas
		station attendants and waitresses
		anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		My report is on Global Economic
		Trends.
			(clears throat;
				 begins reading)
		Try and think of a world where there
		is no poverty... no sickness... no
		crime. A world where everyone is
		happy to be alive and everyone lives
		together in peace. This is my dream.

	The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
	BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
	with her report.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		This dream is becoming a reality
		with ever-growing international
		business...

	CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
	turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
	louder.

				MISS KREPPS
		Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

	Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
	voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
	report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
	WIND increases.

	A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
	spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
	to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
	it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
	billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
	with laughter.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		Louder, Meagan... we still can't
		hear you.

	But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
	busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
	the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
	over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
	blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
	that too is swept off.

	Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
	to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
	naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
	face.

	Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
	all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
	in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
	wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

				FREDDY
		Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
		to blow!

	Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
	of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
	pleading:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse... please, help me.

	But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
	up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
	expressionless face.

				FREDDY
		Looks like a photo opportunity to
		me!

	Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
	flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
	beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
	front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
	sneers:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Say... cheesecake!

	PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
	light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
	against the blackboard -- vaporized!

					HARD CUT TO:

	Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
	as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

				MISS KREPPS
		Meagan? Meagan?!

	Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your report?

	Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
	herself together.

				MEAGAN
		Sure...

	Meagan stands up and faints.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

	MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
	standing over her.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
		know where you are?

	Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

				MEAGAN
		I was day dreaming and then I woke
		up but then it was like I was still
		dreaming and then I woke up and
		then I guess I fainted and now I'm
		awake again...

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Are you sure?

	Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(continuing)
		Meagan?

				MEAGAN
		I'm waiting to see if you're going
		to turn into Freddy.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Freddy... I see. You've been watching
		too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
		cult thing -- it's all over the TV
		day and night -- you can't get away
		from it. No wonder you kids are all
		having nightmares.

				MEAGAN
		But this one was different... it
		felt real.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
		aren't real. They're just broken
		fragments of the subconscious mind.

				MEAGAN
		Fear is real though, isn't it? And
		if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
		that make them real?!
			(gets excited)
		And if the nightmares are real then
		is reality like a dream?!

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(cutting her off)
		Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
		that's all.

	The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
	nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

				MEAGAN
		Old witch... what does she know?
		She isn't even qualified to give a
		shot and she's telling me that my
		dreams aren't anything to worry
		about.

				JESSE
		So she said you were okay?

				MEAGAN
		Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
		says it's just a case of heat pro-
		stration and an overdose of TV news.
		Ruined my makeup, too.

				JESSE
		So you're going back to class?

				MEAGAN
		No. She gave me last period off.

				JESSE
		Well, what are you bitching about?
		I could have a compound fracture of
		the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
		from P.E.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! I've been having nightmares
		for almost two weeks now and they
		keep getting worse! Now I'm having
		daymares! I want to know why!

				JESSE
		Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
		it was heat probation?

	Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

				MEAGAN
		You don't understand... I want to
		know more about dreams. What they
		mean... why we have them.

				JESSE
		Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
		got the rest of the day off, that's
		all I'm saying.

				MEAGAN
		That's a good idea. Why don't you
		cut last period and come with me?

				JESSE
		Sure. Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				JESSE
		You want me to cut school so we can
		go to the library?

					   CUT TO:

	INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

	Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
	the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Find anything?

	Jesse looks up suddenly.

				JESSE
		What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

	Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
	TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Did you know that our sub-conscious
		retains everything that ever happened
		to us? Everything. From the time
		we're born until we die.

				JESSE
		Really?

				MEAGAN
		That's how Freddy gets at us...
		by using our sub-conscious fears.
		Fears our conscious minds have
		repressed or forgotten.

				JESSE
		I've got a news flash for you...
		Freddy's dead.

				MEAGAN
		I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
		in our sub-conscious then he can
		never be fully erased. Like a bad
		memory... you may blot it out of
		your mind but it will alway be
		hiding someplace in your dreams.
			(off Jesse's
				 disbelieving stare)
		Weren't you scared as a child by
		something so stupid that you're
		ashamed to admit it?

				JESSE
		No.

				MEAGAN
		No?

				JESSE
		Well, yeah.

				MEAGAN
		Well, what? What is it?

				JESSE
		Well... when I was kid, my brother
		took me to the carnival. And in the
		penny arcade there was this robot
		gunslinger...

				MEAGAN
		Black Bart.

				JESSE
		You know about Black Bart?

				MEAGAN
		Duh. You put your quarter in and he
		says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
		And then you pull your gun out and
		shoot him.

				JESSE
		That's just it -- I never could!
		I'd point the gun right at him and
		shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
		So I always got killed.

				MEAGAN
		No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

				JESSE
		Scared the shit out of me.

	Meagan tries to hide her smile.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 flustered)
		Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
		kid?

	Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 mad)
		Okay, smartass... what about you?
		What scared you the most as a kid?

	A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

				MEAGAN
		I remember... Lizzy wandered off
		one day and we couldn't find her.
		The police came and everything. I
		wasn't really worried until I saw
		her picture on TV... then I got
		really scared.
			(then)
		Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
		think something bad's going to
		happen.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
	her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
	her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
	disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

				LEONARD
		You're stupid!

				LIZZY
		No, you are!

				LEONARD
		They forgot you again!

				LIZZY
		No, they didn't!

				LEONARD
		Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
		to wait out here until it's dark
		and then the monsters are goin'
		come and get you!

				LIZZY
		No they won't, because I'm walkin'
		home!

	Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
	calls after her:

				LEONARD
		Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
		me! I got forgot too, you know!

	Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
	yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
	bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
	down as he follows after Lizzy.

				LEONARD
			(continuing)
		Okay... I'm going to have to report
		this!

	Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
	she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
	standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
	Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
	glances back, the figure is still standing... but
	closer.

	Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
	she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
	street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
	of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
	reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

	The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
	it roars off down the street.

	CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
	in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
	car and rushes inside.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
	calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
	Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Didn't you get my message?

				MEAGAN
		What message?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		I called the school after lunch...
		I had to stay late after work...
		I...

	Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
	she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
	drunk and has been crying.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Don't you dare blame this on her,
		you sorry bastard! It's all your
		fault!
			(to Meagan)
		Where have you been anyway?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		A likely Goddamn story!

	Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

				MEAGAN
		Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
		Where's Lizzy?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		She didn't come home from school
		today. The police got a report that
		a girl fitting Lizzy's description
		was forced into a car by some
		crazies. They're pretty sure it was
		this "Freddy" cult.

				MEAGAN
			(shocked)
		Oh, my God...

	Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
	comfort her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Now don't worry. The police are
		doing everything they can.

	Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
	men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

				TROOPER
			(O.S.)
		Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
		up here!


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

	As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
	the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
	the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
	attention to the floor next to the bed.

	Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
	including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
	the top.

	Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

				TROOPER
		Looks like she was in the cult all
		along.

				MEAGAN
		No... no, she wouldn't do that!
		Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

				TROOPER
		I know it's hard to believe, miss.
		But a lot of good kids get caught
		up in this kind of trouble.

	Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
	tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
	little unicorn.

				MURDOCH
		Punks...

	Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
	the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Captain Murdoch... is there any-
		thing we can do?

				MURDOCH
		You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
		daughter before... well, before it's
		too late. But rest assured, if I
		can't persuade her to come back to
		her loving home, then I'll do what's
		best for her. I know you and your
		wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
			(to his men)
		Come on... I want to go talk to
		Erwin.

	Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
	Jesse out of the house.

				JESSE
		Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		Over to Stormie's.

				JESSE
		Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
		friends anymore since she stole that
		twenty dollars from you.

				MEAGAN
		That was her "klepto" phase... when
		she was dating that gang member.
		She dumped him a long time ago.

				JESSE
		I still don't understand. What has
		she got to do with Lizzy missing?

				MEAGAN
		She used to be in the Freddy cult.
		Maybe she knows where they took
		Lizzy.

	They exit to Jesse's car.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
	blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

				STORMIE
		If I did know I would call the
		police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
		No telling what those freaks will
		do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
		are hard core.

				JESSE
		I thought you were in the cult?

				STORMIE
		I was in the cult for a week cause
		my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
		he was. But I just liked the music
		and the clothes... when they were
		clean, but not like the violence
		and stuff. But that was just my
		"cult" phase... but I got past that.
		You know, just like my "gang" phase
		when I was dating Ramon and then
		before that was my "death rock"
		phase when I was dating Stuart...

				JESSE
		Uh, excuse me... but what phase
		are we in now?

				STORMIE
		Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
		what's it fuckin' to ya?!

				JESSE
			(to Meagan)
		Why don't you just let the cops find
		her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
		knows how to deal with these cultist
		psychos. He was the man who got Jason
		Voorhees.

				MEAGAN
		That guy in my dreams...

				STORMIE
		Jason kicked his ass.

						   QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

	Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
	younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
	Jason in panic.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
		thirteen bullets in Jason before
		he hacked his head open.

	Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
	staggers back, raising his pistol.

				JESSE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		But even with his head hacked open
		and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
		still managed to put his last bullet
		in Jason's eye.

	Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
	Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
	body hits the ground.


	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

	Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
	Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
	medical contraptions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
		worked at the hospital where they
		took him. He said that Murdoch lost
		more than half his brain and what
		little that was left was all twisted
		up inside. And they had to replace
		his skull with a metal plate to
		keep that from leaking out.

	In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
	eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		They say he hasn't been the same
		since.

					CUT BACK TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

				JESSE
		So what's different about him?

				STORMIE
		One thing... he used to be a
		Democrat. Now he votes straight
		Republican.

				MEAGAN
		I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
		cult or something.

				STORMIE
		Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

				MEAGAN
		I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
		got to find her and save her from
		Freddy before that crazy cop kills
		her.

				JESSE
		Just where are you going to look?
		I mean, these cult guys could be
		holding her anywhere.

				MEAGAN
		Murdoch said something about going
		to talk to somebody named Erwin.

				STORMIE
		Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
		Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
		they took Lizzy!

				JESSE
		Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
		that used to eat bugs?

				STORMIE
			(annoyed)
		Who else?
			(to Meagan; bright)
		Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
		home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
		up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
		Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
		back and the cops put him away for
		his own safety. They say Freddy's
		put a death hex on Erwin.

				JESSE
		A death hex?

				STORMIE
		Yes, a death hex. You know... where
		someone wants you dead!

				MEAGAN
		Where is he?

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

	Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
	and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
	park, Meagan turns to him and says:

				MEAGAN
		I want you to stay here.

				JESSE
		Why?

				MEAGAN
		Don't be mad... it's just that you
		might scare him.

				JESSE
		Scare him?

				STORMIE
		What she's subtly trying to tell
		you is that this needs a woman's
		gentle touch... butthead.

				MEAGAN
		Just stay here... okay?

	Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
	cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
	turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
	the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
	row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
	on the glass.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
		of visitors. Now be a good boy...
			(to Meagan & Stormie)
		You've got five minutes. I'll be
		right down the hall if you need me.

	The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
	thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
	They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
	little closer to the glass.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin...?

	SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
	face to the glass as he screams:

				ERWIN
		SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

	Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
	quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
	inspection.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Where do you shoot?

				MEAGAN
		Shoot?

				STORMIE
		He's talking about dream dope --
		the stuff the cultists shoot up
		with so they can talk to Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		I don't do drugs.

				ERWIN
		You're not in the cult?

				MEAGAN
		No.

				ERWIN
		Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

				MEAGAN/STORMIE
		No.

				ERWIN
		I don't trust you... better take off
		your clothes so I can check you for
		tracks.

				STORMIE
		Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
		hard data -- not a floppy disk.

	Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
	to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
	mattress.

				ERWIN
		Well, what do you want? Can't you
		see I'm busy?

				MEAGAN
		Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

				STORMIE
		I told her you might know where
		they took her.

				ERWIN
		I already told the cops everything
		I know.

				MEAGAN
		Tell me... please.

				ERWIN
		Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
		but I've got my own problems with
		Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

				MEAGAN
		Then tell me why they took her...

				ERWIN
		To bear his child. Freddy wants to
		be human again. In order to do that
		he has to be "reborn".

				MEAGAN
		How can he do that?

				ERWIN
		He has to marry a virgin on holy
		ground. Then the cult consumate
		the marriage by impregnating her.

				STORMIE
		The whole cult? Yeech!

				ERWIN
		Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
		It's sort of a tradition with him.

				MEAGAN
		So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

				ERWIN
		And Freddy enters the soul of the
		fetus through a dream state. Voila!
		Rebirth.

	There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

				STORMIE
		That's the stupidest shit I ever
		heard.

				ERWIN
		Hey, they're not my rules... some-
		body else wrote 'em.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... you've got to help me find
		Lizzy. You're my only hope.

	Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

				ERWIN
		I'll help you find your sister, but
		you've got to help me.

				MEAGAN
		Anything. Just name it.

				ERWIN
		You have to help me kill Freddy.

	Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

				STORMIE
		But Freddy's dead.

				ERWIN
		Freddy lives...
			(looks at Meagan)
		If only in our dreams.

	Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
	her away.

				STORMIE
		Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
		is up. He's giving me the creeps.

	But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

				MEAGAN
		How can you kill a dream?

				ERWIN
		When it's not a dream.
			(then)
		Do we have a deal?

	Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
	thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
	over his.

				MEAGAN
		Deal.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
	a pay phone, arguing.

				JESSE
		No! I won't do it!

				MEAGAN
		Come on, Jesse! Please...?

				JESSE
		It's illegal! I could go to jail!

				STORMIE
		How will they ever know? Don't be
		such a pussy!

				JESSE
		Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

				STORMIE
		Okay, I will!

				MEAGAN
		No! They'll never believe her!

				STORMIE
		I can disguise my voice...
			(lowers voice)
		Hello, how do you do? My name is
		Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
		actually a wimp.

				MEAGAN
		They'll never believe that. Come
		on, Jesse... for me?

				JESSE
		Okay... okay... I'll do it.
			(to Stormie)
		And I'm not a wimp!

	Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
	moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
	both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
	the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
	girls shut up, he says:

				JESSE
			(continuing)
		I need a quarter for the phone.

	Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
	re-enters the booth.

	ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

	The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Springwood Mental Center... how
		can I help you?

				JESSE
			(filtered; disguising
				 his voice)
		There's a bomb planted in your
		building.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Who is this?

				JESSE
		If I were you -- I'd get my ass
		out of there.

	In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
	something to Jesse.

				JESSE
			(continuing; adding)
		Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

	CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

	The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
	fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
	into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
	files out with the others, still wearing his straight
	jacket.

	Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
	flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
	off towards the fence between himself and freedom
	when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

				SECURITY GUARD
		Hey, Erwin... where do you think
		you're going?

	Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

				SECURITY GUARD
			(continuing)
		I'm talking to you, asshole!

	Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
	him.

	In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
	guard closes the distance.

				JESSE
		He's not going to make it.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to do something!

	With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

	Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
	the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
	drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
	Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
	an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
	RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
	does a 180, and PEELS off.

	ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
	of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
	hand to Jesse.

				ERWIN
		Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
		busting me out of there!

	Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
	fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

				JESSE
		Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
		me one favor -- don't eat nothing
		disgusting. My stomach is tight
		enough as it is.

	The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
	puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
	street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
	plucks it out...

	Jesse's front license plate.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

	CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
	close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
	inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
	starts to settle down... falling asleep...

	The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
	her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

	LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
	the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
	gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


	INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
	a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
	is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
	of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
	with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
	hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
	terrible chorus of the damned.

	The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
	the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
	is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
	mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
	swings open as the cultists near.

	The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
	her tight as they push her face forward into the
	mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
	face disappearing into the mirror.

	ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
	face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
	thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
	darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
	the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
	moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
	out.

	The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
	locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
	things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
	the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
	releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

	The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
	the...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
	conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
	as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
	doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
	cultist thrusts under her.

	Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
	mouth -- the Dream Demons.


	EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

	Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
	pulls up next to a run-down building.


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
	old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
	towards the back, to a large table and a collection
	of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
	starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
	syringes laying scattered about the floor.

				ERWIN
		Damn! We must have just missed them!

	Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

				MEAGAN
		Oh, my God -- she was here! This
		is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
		torn!
			(grabs Erwin)
		Erwin... we've got to find her!

				ERWIN
		We're too late! There's no way...
		except...

				MEAGAN
		Except what?!

				ERWIN
		We could go after Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		How?

	Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
	up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
	he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
	box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
	and several pairs of cult shades.

				ERWIN
		We'll inject ourselves with Dream
		Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
		brings on a dreamlike state.

	Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
	approval.

				MEAGAN
		Okay... let's do it!

				JESSE
		Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
		what if one of us gets hooked or
		something?
			(whispers)
		We could turn out like him!

	Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry about it. We need you
		wide awake anyway.

				JESSE
		What for?

				ERWIN
		We're going to go under and try to
		find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
		him and bring him here. Then you
		kill him with this...

	Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

				JESSE
		This rusty chunk of shit? What
		good is this?

				ERWIN
		It's not the gun, it's what's in
		it -- silver bullets blessed by a
		priest.

				JESSE
		Will that work?

				ERWIN
			(shrugs)
		Should. But then...

				JESSE
			(finishes for him)
		You don't make the rules... yeah,
		yeah.

				MEAGAN
		What should we do?

				ERWIN
		Have a seat over there and make
		yourselves comfortable. Roll up
		your sleeves and put these on...

	Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
	sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
	Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

				STORMIE
		Oh, cool!

				MEAGAN
		What are they for?

				ERWIN
		It's how the cult keeps in constant
		contact with Freddy. The little
		lights flashing are a sustained
		occular input that causes your brain
		to resonate at approximately the
		same frequency at which the dream
		state is most likely to occur.

	All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

				STORMIE
		Whatever...
			(to Meagan; excited)
		Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

	Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
	up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
	chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
	takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
	lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
	glasses.

				ERWIN
		It helps to hold hands if you want
		to go together...

	Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
	watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
	a final warning:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		And remember... Freddy knows what
		scares you.

	Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

	INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
	(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
	The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

				ERWIN
		WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
	asleep in their chairs.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
	mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
	pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
	fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
	they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

				LIZZY
			(distant)
		Meagan... help me... please...

	Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
	suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
	and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

				ERWIN
		Freddy's trying to split us up...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
	mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
	and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
	the muzzle as he says:

				JESSE
		Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
		in Dreamland now.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
	boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
	stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
	of Erwin and Stormie.

				FREDDY
		Looking for some-body?

	Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
	lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
	Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
	to Erwin:

				STORMIE
		I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
		us up!

	But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

				FREDDY
		Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

	Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
	claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
	Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
	Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
	apron.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Stew on this, bitch!

	Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
	falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

				STORMIE
		Shoot him! Shoot him!

	Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Freddy turns toward Erwin.

				FREDDY
		Well, well, well... if it isn't
		my ol' pal, Erwin.

	Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've got something special in mind
		for you...

	Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
	out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
	his finger.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

				STORMIE
		You didn't help me, you pussy!
		I could've had him!
			(smacks him some more)
		You gutless... spinless... jelly
		fish!

	Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


	INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

	Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
	Lizzy's voice...

				LIZZY
			(V.O.)
		Meagan... help me... Meagan...

	It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
	door.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
	table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
	FREDDY LIVES!

				MEAGAN
		Daddy?

	He looks up and quietly shushes her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

	And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
	newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
	again... upstairs.

	As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
	her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
	looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
	to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
	mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

	Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
	for help draws her to...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
	covers.

				LIZZY
		Help me...

	Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
	pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
	her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
	it's way out.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Meagan...

	Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
	Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
	Meagan in the chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
	Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

				STORMIE
		Are you okay?

	They help Meagan to her feet.

				MEAGAN
			(shaky)
		He got away... I had him and he
		got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
		lost her...

				ERWIN
		Well, atleast you're not dead.

				MEAGAN
		No... I'm not dead...
			(realizes)
		No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

				STORMIE
		He killed me, too. But look...

	Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
	unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
	Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

				MEAGAN
		Now that I think about it -- he's
		killed me in all my nightmares. But
		I'm not dead... what does it mean?

				ERWIN
		It means we've still got some time
		left. Until his remains are host to
		the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
		hurt us.

				JESSE
		Hello. The Dream Demons...?

				ERWIN
		Freddy made a pact with Satan when
		he died... so Satan bestowed upon
		him the Dream Demons. They're the
		source of Freddy's power to manipulate
		our physical reality. Without them...
		he's powerless -- nothing more than
		a bad dream.
			(off Jesse's cynical
				 look)
		Hey, like I said... I don't make
		the rules.

				MEAGAN
		But we've still got a chance, right?
		A chance to kill Freddy before he
		gets back his power?

				ERWIN
		We already tried that. There's no
		way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
		clever. He knows how to get to us.

				MEAGAN
		Then let's get somebody else. Some-
		body strong.

				STORMIE
		Yeah! We could hire somebody to
		kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

				ERWIN
		You would have to hire a thousand
		of them... or one really big guy
		who isn't afraid of anything. No
		fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

				JESSE
		Where are you going to find a hit
		man? The yellow pages? In your
		dreams...

	Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
	bolt and she stammers out a name:

				MEAGAN
		Jason...

				JESSE
		Jason?

				MEAGAN
		Jason Voorhees...

				ERWIN
			(brightens)
		Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
		The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

				STORMIE
		Sounds like our man!

				JESSE
		Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
		isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

				ERWIN
		Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
		Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
		know how to bring him back to life.

				JESSE
		Somehow I just knew you would.

				ERWIN
		But that's not the problem. The
		problem is control. Once we bring
		Jason back from the dead... I'm not
		one hundred percent sure he'll do
		what we tell him.

				STORMIE
		Well, that's okay... as long as he
		doesn't chop us all up.

	Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
		so tell me the truth. Do you think
		if we do this -- if we go and get
		Jason and bring him back to life,
		that he could kill Freddy?

				ERWIN
		No doubt about. Jason could wreck
		Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
		But if Freddy has home court advan-
		tage... I don't know. Too close to
		call. The trick would be to get Jason
		to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
		and drag him out to our reality.

				MEAGAN
		I haven't got a choice. I've got to
		try something...
			(turns to Stormie &
				 Jesse)
		I can't ask either of you to help
		me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
		disgusting...

				STORMIE
		Hey, we sisters have to stand
		together, right? Where you lead --
		I'll follow. Count me in.

	Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
	He looks them over and sighs:

				JESSE
		Let me get this straight... we're
		going to go dig one dead maniac up
		to fight another dead maniac?

				ERWIN
		That's about the size of it... and
		I'd be doing you a disservice if I
		said there weren't a modicum of risk
		involved.

				JESSE
		Meagan... I don't want to do this...

				MEAGAN
		You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
		your fight. I understand.

				JESSE
		But I damn sure don't want you to
		do it without me. Count me in.

	Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
	she pushes him away.

				ERWIN
		Look out Freddy... here we come.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

	In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
	is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
	up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
	the radio.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
		What's matter, girl... you hear
		somethin'?

	Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
	closer.

	The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
	into the darkness when a line of several hearses
	approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
	the driver's window rolls down.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(continuing)
		What's this? A funeral procession?

	A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
	and says:

				CULTIST
		That's exactly what it is.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(suspicious)
		Yeah? Whose?

				CULTIST
		Yours.

	BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
	the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
	a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
	ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

	Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
	the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
	cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
	procession proceeds inside.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

	The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
	cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
	wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
	of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
	charred bones.

	Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
	and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
	around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
	with droopy eyes.

	LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
	the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
	Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
	more surreal as another cult member steps forward
	with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
	the funnel.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
	around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
	blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
	muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

	There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
	Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
	leaps out of the pit and cries:

				FREDDY
		Smokin'!

	Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
	FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
	building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
	them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
	reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		We're almost there...

				MEAGAN
			(V.O.)
		We should pull over and ask
		directions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		If it doesn't offend the men...
		ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Very funny.


	EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
	station.

				STORMIE
		I don't think they're open.

				MEAGAN
		It says, open all night.

	Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

				JESSE
		Hey! Can we get some service out
		here?!

				STORMIE
		I don't think there's anybody
		here...

	Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
	side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you kids want?

				MEAGAN
		We're looking for the old cemetery
		that's supposed to be around here...
		somewhere.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you want to know for?

				STORMIE
		We want to see it.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
		'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

				JESSE
		Look, mister... can you give us
		directions or not?

	The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
	over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
	Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
	under a baseball cap.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		You're not goin' up there to do
		somethin' stupid, are you?

				JESSE
			(laughs; nervous)
		Stupid? Like what?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
		that's what!

	Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
	busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
	their heads innocently in a big performance that
	wouldn't fool a stick.

				JESSE
			(looks at Meagan)
		Jesus... why would anyone do that?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		I dunno... but people do.

				STORMIE
		Been dug up a few times already,
		has he?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		More times than I care to remember.

				MEAGAN
		Well, we're just doing an article
		for our high school newspaper about
		the dangers of breaking into
		cemeteries at night. You know,
		stuff that can get you hurt...

	The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
	acquiesces.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well... okay... as long as you're
		not going up there to do something
		stupid.
			(pointing)
		Take this road up about a mile and
		make a left at the ol' saw mill.
		That road will take you right on
		in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
		can't miss it.

	Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
	ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
	PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
	WILL BE SHOT!

	Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
	cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
	shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
	Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		What's the story on Jason Voorhees
		anyway?

				STORMIE
		Where have you been? Jason was that
		guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
		chopping up camp counselors, duh?

				MEAGAN
		I knew that. What I mean was why?

				ERWIN
		It started a long time ago, back in
		the fifties, when Jason drown at
		Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
		berserk and started killing the
		counselors.

				STORMIE
		She got her head chopped off by one
		of the girls she was trying to kill!

				ERWIN
		Right. And then Jason came back from
		his watery grave to get revenge.

				JESSE
		He came back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
		before they finally caught up to him.

				MEAGAN
		What happened to him then?

				ERWIN
		They killed him.

				JESSE
		How can you kill somebody who's
		back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Not very well apparently. Jason
		keeps coming back to life and
		chopping people up. It's a never
		ending cycle of terror up here at
		Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

				MEAGAN
		Why does he keep coming back to
		life and killing people?

				ERWIN
		They say he's looking for revenge
		on the camp counselor who murdered
		him as a child. Jason just happens
		to go about it in the socially
		unacceptable way of hacking through
		every teenager he finds until he
		gets the right one.
			(spots grave)
		Here it is...

	Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

	ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
	Died:1953.

	Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
	stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

	Jesse and Erwin start digging.

	ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
	Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
	hits something solid.

	Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
	coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
	jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

	The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
	noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
	and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

	Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

	Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
	their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
	the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
	shirt, and calmly eats it.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
	holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
	hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
	tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
	taking anymore chances with bugs.

	Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
	at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
	-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
	mask.

					CUT TO:

	The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
	Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
	the lid closed.

	Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

	In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
	Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
	Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
	and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

				ERWIN
		Look... the boogerman!
			(laughs)
		Get it?!

	Stormie slaps his hand away.

				STORMIE
		Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
		Ug! I thought I had seen the last
		of those when my brother graduated
		third grade!

				ERWIN
		We just dug up a rotting corpse and
		you're worried about a little snot.

	Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
	beside him.  She purrs:

				MEAGAN
		I'm exhausted... wake me when we
		get back home.

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
		we've still got a lot of work to
		do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

	This news sobers everyone up immediately.

				STORMIE
		Well, that means we've all got to
		stay awake!

				JESSE
		Duh?!

				MEAGAN
		I know! We'll sing a song!
			(starts singing)
		Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
		the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream. Come
		on, everybody!

	Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
	chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
	the night.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
	to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

				MEAGAN
		...merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream.

	In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
	breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

	Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
	drooping.  The car starts to weave.

	ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
	a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
	FOR FOOD.

	Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
	on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

	Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
	board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
	out of the driver's window.

	CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
	ground, the red digits cascading up.

	Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
	the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
	his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

				FREDDY
		Shouldn't dream and drive.

	Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
	out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
	it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
	belching HELLFIRE.

	ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
	close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
	maremobile closing from behind fast.

	The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
	car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
	of the dozen of levers on the dash.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
	of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
	of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
	the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
	trunk lid opens.

	ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
	remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
	the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
	of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
	of the bag.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Looks like the cat's out of the
		bag now!

	Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

	The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
	car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
	all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
	startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
	nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

				MEAGAN
		It's Freddy!

	WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
	as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
	dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
	maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
	A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

	Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
	the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
	back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
	seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
	EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
	their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
	boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
	the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
	under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

	As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
	she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
	her legs.  Meagan screams.

	Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
	forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
	SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
	to swerve violently from side to side.

	Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

	CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
	up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
	into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
	Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
	CUTTING forward towards...

	CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
	it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
	road, veering into a tree line.

	CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
	the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

	Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
	overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
	EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

	In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
	on inside.

	The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
	ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
	door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
	embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
	around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
	is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
	Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
	Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
		to get him to a doctor.

	Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
	the farmer on the phone.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry... an ambulance is on
		the way.

	Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

				MEAGAN
		Oh, God... Jesse...

	Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
	garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
	untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

				ERWIN
		Meagan... listen to me... The cops
		are on their way. If they find me
		and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
		there, we're finished.

				MEAGAN
		Go... get out of here. Take Jason
		and Stormie with you.

				STORMIE
		I'm staying with you.

	Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

				ERWIN
		I'll call you at the hospital.

				STORMIE
		How?

				ERWIN
		Somehow!

	Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
	into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
	growing close.

					CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
	special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
	doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
	finishes, Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		Is he going to be okay?

				DOCTOR
		Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
		His leg is broken in four places
		and he has four broken ribs and a
		concussion.

	Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
	Stormie turns to the doctor.

				STORMIE
		Hey doc, is there someplace I
		could get us something to eat?

				DOCTOR
		I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
		There are some vending machines in
		the lobby.
			(to Meagan)
		I'll be back to check on him in a
		couple of hours.

	The doctor exits.

				STORMIE
		I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
		score us some munchies.

	Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
	head on Jesse's hand.


	INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
	the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
	at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
	and Erwin.

	Stormie dashes for the staircase.


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
	monitor BEEPS...

	On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
	peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
	ducks back down.

	Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
	and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

	Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
	onto the curtain.

	CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
	the rings.

	Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
	away.

	Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
	again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
	are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
	of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
	the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
	mattress.


	INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
	she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
	along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
	them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
	out into...


	EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
	in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
	and gunbelt.

	Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
	fear... staring at something coming down the street.

	It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

				FREDDY
			(ala John Wayne)
		Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
		ain't big enough for the two of
		us... draw!

	Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
	He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
	FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
	and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
	and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

	Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

				FREDDY
		Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
		you just go get [BEEP]


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
	wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


	INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

	Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
	empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
	gun you ever saw and says:

				FREDDY
		Go ahead... make my dream!

	Freddy FIRES!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
	Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
	flat line.  Jesse is dead.

	A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
	Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
	and screams.

	Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
	gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy killed Jesse...

	Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
	of the room.


	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
	the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

				STORMIE
		Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
		think a nurse in a hospital would
		have seen a dead body before.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse...

	Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
	off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
	come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
	Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
	and company go thundering past.

	Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
		please pick up the white paging
		phone for a message?

	Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
	announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
	Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
	and picks up the white paging phone.

				STORMIE
			(into phone)
		This is Stormie...

	Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
	station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
	Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

				MURDOCH
		Did you see a couple of girls go
		by here a moment ago?

	Stormie gestures to the elevators.

				STORMIE
		Just missed 'em.

	Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
	men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
	relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

				HOSPITAL OPERATOR
			(filtered)
		The message is from Erwin... he
		says to meet him at the side
		entrance in two minutes.

	Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
	staircase.


	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
	Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
	He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
	inside, climbing in after her and asking:

				STORMIE
		Where'd you get the truck?

				ERWIN
		Same place I've got Jason hid.

				STORMIE
		And where's that?

				ERWIN
		A place where no one ever goes.

	Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
	out of the parking lot.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
	worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
	past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
	short distance away from the pier and the three of
	them climb out.

	Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
	as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
	platform tied up to the end.

				STORMIE
		What'd you do -- take him for a
		swim?

				ERWIN
		Almost.

	Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
	a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
	down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
	pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
	Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
	asks:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Is she going to be alright?

				STORMIE
		I don't know. She's pretty fucked
		up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

				ERWIN
		You're a strong woman.

				STORMIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
		anything.

	Stormie gestures to the tarp.

				STORMIE
		Is this him?

				ERWIN
		Yeah...
			(whips back tarp)
		Meet the new and improved Jason.

	ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
	platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
	coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
	done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
	barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
	been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
	mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
	bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

				STORMIE
		Why'd you put that stupid mask
		on him?

				ERWIN
		Take a look...

	Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
	and quickly replaces it.

				STORMIE
		Good idea.

				ERWIN
		Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
		is he?

				STORMIE
		So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
		Osbourne song backwards or something?

				ERWIN
		I'm afraid it's not that simple...

				STORMIE
		I thought you said you knew how to
		bring him back to life?

				ERWIN
		I do! But when I was putting him
		back together, I noticed something
		was missing.

	Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

				STORMIE
		Awwww, he won't be needing that...
		I mean, what girl would let him
		put his rotten ol'...

				ERWIN
			(cuts her off)
		No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
		it's missing.

				STORMIE
		Well... does it really matter?
		Can't you use an aquarium pump or
		something?

				ERWIN
		No... he has to have a heart. A
		human heart. A good one.

	Meagan speaks for the first time:

				MEAGAN
		I know where we can get a heart...
		A good one.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
	a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
	Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
	parked a safe distance away.

				ERWIN
		That guard in there might pose a
		problem.

				MEAGAN
		Do you think you and Stormie could
		keep him occupied for a few minutes?

	Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
	not?

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Okay... let's do it.

	A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
	up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
	and goes to the glass door, peering out.

	ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
	making out -- hot and heavy.


	INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

	Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
	crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
	to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
	dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
	full of organs, etc.

	Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
	one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
	ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
	Even worse.

	Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
	to quiver as she caresses his face.


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
	in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
	He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
	better look.

	Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

				STORMIE
		Hey! Watch that!

				ERWIN
		I'm just trying to make it look real.

				STORMIE
		Just keep your hands above the bra,
		pizza face.

	The windows are starting to steam up.


	INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

	Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
	gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
	ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
	knife.

	Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
	sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
	far above her head.

				MEAGAN
		Forgive me, Jesse...

	Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
	sickening THWACK!


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
	obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
	deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
	the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
	They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
	another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
	parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
	his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

	Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
	shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
	guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
	the morgue.

				STORMIE
		He's head right for her! Do some-
		thing!

	Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


	INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
	chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
	fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
	then starts pulling harder.

	In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
	and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
	the HORN stops.

	Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
	to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
	tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

	The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
	drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
	unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
	two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
	and kicks the door.

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
	inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
	He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
	of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
	a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
	a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
	cabinet...

	Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
	and cries:

				GUARD
		Stop right there!

	Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
	The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
	curses and races for the...


	EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

	The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
	close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
	shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
	guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
	that the door has closed and locked behind him.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
	cemetery.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		They said they were writin' for
		some newspaper...

				MURDOCH
		Teenagers are notorious liars.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well, after I heard about the
		accident on my police scanner, I
		came up here to have a look. When
		I found it I figured you'd want to
		know right away.

				MURDOCH
		You did the right thing.

	The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
	grave.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Damn kids... I just knew they were
		comin' up here to do somethin'
		stupid.

	The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Just got a call on the radio --
		three juveniles just broke into the
		morgue -- one male, two female. The
		guard is pretty sure the male is in
		the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Sounds like the same kids I saw.

				MURDOCH
		Did the guard say what they took?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
		they carved his heart out.
			(beat)
		They got away in a pick-up -- the
		guard didn't get the license. You
		want me to put out an A.P.B.?

				MURDOCH
		No... that won't be necessary. I
		know just where they're going, and
		just what they're up to. And this
		time... I'll be ready.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
	as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
	dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
	her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
	her and says:

				STORMIE
		You've got to quit blaming your-
		self for what happened to Jesse...
		it wasn't your fault.

				MEAGAN
		He didn't want to come with us...
		but he did anyway. He did it for me.

				STORMIE
		I'm not sorry I came... I don't
		think Jesse would be, either.

				MEAGAN
		I just can't believe he's dead. I
		keep thinking he'll show up any
		minute...

				ERWIN
		Well, that just about does it...

	Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
	the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
	it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
	Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
	them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
	from the water's edge.

	In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
	cable.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		As you can see, I've excavated the
		power cable that runs across the
		bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
		away the insulation, exposing a
		patch of cable right near the water's
		edge.

	Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
	at the head of the trench.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Now when I kick this over, the water
		will wash down the trench and bridge
		an eletrical gap between the cable
		and the lake. There's plenty of
		voltage, so it should work.

				STORMIE
		So you kick the bucket and Jason
		lives.

				ERWIN
		Yeah, right...
			(then)
		Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

	Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
	the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
	A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
	glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
	girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
	engulfing the diving platform.

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
	onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

	CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
	spirals down into the eye hole like water running
	down a drain.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
	eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

					OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

	EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

	CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
	reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
	pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
	beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

	JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
	down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
	rye. He bellows:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Jason! Git your ass over here!

	Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
	slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
	several paces away.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		What did I teach you, boy? Don't
		ever take your mask off out in
		public. I don't want nobody to see
		that ugly mug of yours.

	Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
	smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
	woodshed.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Go git in the woodshed.

	Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
	knows what's coming next.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Drop them overalls and lay over
		them logs...

	Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
	Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
	calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Jason! Come here!

	Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
	towards his mother.

				JASON'S FATHER
		What are you doing woman?

	Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
	dollars and change.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I saved up some money... I want
		you to take and go on up to that
		summer camp just up the road. Tell
		the man you want to stay there.

				JASON'S FATHER
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing, bitch?!

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

				JASON'S FATHER
		You ain't sending him nowhere.
			(to Jason)
		Bring me that money, boy!

	Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
	obey, when his mother shoos him away.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Go on now... go!

	Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
		the shed, woman!

	Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		You ain't ever taking anyone to
		the shed ever again.

	Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
	back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
	Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
	coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
	arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
	view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
	way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
	him, calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		Go on, son... have a good time!
		Mommy will come and git you some
		day soon!

	Jason turns and runs to...


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
	to the camp with his jar of money.

	In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
	and shakes his hand.

				HEAD COUNSELOR
		Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
		you'll have a great time!

					CUT TO:

	The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
	laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
	breaks away, running towards the pier.

	Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
	reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
	distortions in the water make his face look normal.

	Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
	aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
	appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
	he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

	Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
	stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
	water.

	JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
	whoever is holding him under.

	Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
	the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
	him before he dies.

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
	the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
	shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

				ERWIN
		Holy shit! It worked!

	Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
	is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
	to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

				MEAGAN
		It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
		it off!

				ERWIN
		Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
		to me that I hadn't really planned
		for that contingency.

				STORMIE
		Just don't stand there! Do something!

	But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
	rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
		Do you hear me? Get up!

	Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
	against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
	rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

	A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
	and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
	electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
	smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
	Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

				ERWIN
		Well... it's off now.

	Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
	shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
	between them, offering quick excuses and humble
	apologies.

	All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
	never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
	the lake.

	Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
	after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
	gait.

	Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
	dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
	out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
	and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
	and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
	then calls to the girls:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
		up in the tool shed!

	Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
	through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
	girl and runs away.


	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
	spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

				MEAGAN
		Who are you calling?!

				STORMIE
		The cops! Who else?!

				MEAGAN
		Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
		up and throw away the key!

				STORMIE
		Fine by me!
			(clicks the receiver)
		Damnit! It's dead!

	Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
	the door shut behind him.

				ERWIN
		He's right behind me!

	Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
	Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

				STORMIE
			(to Erwin)
		You're the one who brought him
		back to life!

				ERWIN
		And?!

				STORMIE
		Well, do something!

	Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
	Stormie clucks:

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, some hero!

	Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
	Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
	closet, closing themselves inside.

	They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
	moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
	breathing.

	Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
	closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
	out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

	Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
	up in front of him and yells:

				MEAGAN
		STOP!

	To everyone's shock... Jason does.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now... just stop! We're the ones
		that brought you back to life.
		And you have no right to kill us
		with that chainsaw! In fact... you
		owe us...

				STORMIE
		That's right! She gave you her
		boyfriend's heart, you know!

				MEAGAN
		That's right.

	Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Look! Here's his picture...

	Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
	opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
	inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
	in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
	Jesse with a meaty finger.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now, I know that you've been through
		a lot. And I know that you're pissed
		off about being murdered and all.

				STORMIE
			(interjects)
		I know I would be!

				MEAGAN
		But if you help us kill Freddy
		Krueger... I promise to help you
		find the little bastard that
		killed you. What do you say? Have
		we got a deal?

	Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
	it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
	he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

	Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
	windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
	get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
	the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

	ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
	lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
	weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
	force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		You in there! This is Captain Renton
		Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
		ordering you to come out with your
		hands up! I'll give you until the
		count of three...
			(beat)
		Three!

	Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
	closet.

				MEAGAN
			(whispering)
		Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
		here and don't come out until we
		tell you. Stormie... help me!

	Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
	closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
	their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
	raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
	the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
	in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
	searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright... anybody else left in
		there had better say their prayers!

				ERWIN
		There's no one else inside.

				MURDOCH
		Is that a fact?
			(into bullhorn)
		Okay... you had your chance!

	Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
	and shouts:

				COP
		Hey, look!

	All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
	massive frame is filling the doorway.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Holy Mary, mother of God... would
		you look at the size of that guy?

				MURDOCH
			(almost happy)
		I knew it!

	All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
	suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
	behind him.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Stand back! I'll handle this.

	Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		You...

	Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
	Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
	a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

	A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
	down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
	up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing;
				 into radio)
		Let her go.


	EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
	laser-guided napalm bomb.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

	A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
	Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

	SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
	in on the laser dot on his chest.

	BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
	All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
	Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
	as he embraces the terrible sight.

				MURDOCH
		That'll teach you to fuck with the
		law, Voorhees!

	A cop behind him says:

				COP
		Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

	Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
	is burning above the brim.

	Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
	flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
	a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
	Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
	worrisome looks through the windows just before the
	cars pull away.

	As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
	something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
	form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
	onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

				CURIOUS COP
		Hey... do you see that?

	But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
	pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
	looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

				PARTNER
		See what?

				CURIOUS COP
		I thought I saw something...

	He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

	Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
	sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
	car and driving away.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

	A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
	door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
	behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
	female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
	her desk.

	Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
	watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
	begins to devour three combo-burritos.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to try and stay awake.

				STORMIE
		Getting something to eat might help.
			(calls to Deputy)
		Yo, Butch!

				DEPUTY MILLER
		It's Deputy Miller.

				STORMIE
		Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
		we have something to eat?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		I thought you psychos only ate
		human hearts?

				STORMIE
		And I thought you pigs only ate
		donuts.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Don't make me come back there.

				STORMIE
			(low; to Meagan)
		Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
		combo-burrito cud!

	Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
	the floor in defeat.

				MEAGAN
		What am I going to do? I'll never
		be able to find Lizzy now.

				STORMIE
		You should be worrying about your-
		self... I know I am.

	Stormie plops down on her cot.

				MEAGAN
		I bet you're sorry you came with
		me now...

				STORMIE
		Nah... what are best friends for?
		Afterall, you stuck by me through
		all my crazy phases, I figure I
		owe you one big crazy phase, right?

				MEAGAN
		That's for being my best friend,
		Stormie.

	Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
	cell, unlocking it.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Come on, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		Where are we going?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Your parents are here.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
	where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
	Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
		Let me look at you...

				MEAGAN
		I'm okay, mom.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mother's been worried sick,
		Meagan. So have I.

	Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
	bloody and soiled.

				MEAGAN
		Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
	that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
	passes behind her.

	The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
	a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
	raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
	stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

	Stormie is fast asleep.

	Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
	the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
	jumps to her feet and screams.

				STORMIE
		Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

	But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
	respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
	licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
	forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
	pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
	self asleep.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

	She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

				FREDDY
		You know what they say... when you
		sleep -- you die!

	Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
		you helped one of those cultists
		escape from a hospital?

				MEAGAN
		A mental hospital.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And he said you desecrated a cemetery
		and some other really terrible things.
		Tell me you had nothing to do with
		it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

				MEAGAN
		There's no mistake.
			(to Murdoch)
		What did you do with Erwin?

				MURDOCH
		Your boyfriend is headed back to the
		looney bin where he belongs. But
		don't worry, you'll be seeing him
		soon enough... at the arraignment.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
	by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
	Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

				STORMIE
		You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
		to my various phases and many hours
		of watching violent televison, I
		have become immune to violence. Seen
		it all and done it all! Nothing you
		do can gross me out -- so why don't
		you give it your best shot, bitch!

				FREDDY
		Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

	Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
	defensive stance.

				STORMIE
		I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
		is a drill sergeant in the Marine
		Corps and he taught me just how to
		defend myself against slimy bastards
		like you.

				FREDDY
		Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
		Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
		I dare you!

	Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
	take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
	right in the nose.

				FREDDY
			(continuing;
				 surprised)
		Owwwww!

	Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
	fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
	breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
	She screams.

	Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
	up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
	Freddy smiles.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Now that's what I call getting a
		buzz.


	INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

	Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
	of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
	the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
	those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
	boogers.

	Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
	rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
	distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

				BOOGERMAN
		Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
		heh... get it?

	Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
	to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
		Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
		I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

	Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
	tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
	screams again.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

	Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

				MEAGAN
		We're wasting time! We've got to
		close down all the churches --
		Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
		ground!

	Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
	frightened looks.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Don't you understand?! He has to
		come to our reality to do it! It's
		our last chance to kill him!

				MURDOCH
		Okay, I think we've heard enough of
		this crap. Take her back to the
		lockup.

	A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
	and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
	watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
	daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

				MEAGAN
		Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
		I have to save Lizzy!

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
		even realize what you've done.

				MEAGAN
		I did what I had to do to try and
		save Lizzy!

				MURDOCH
		Yeah, including murdering your boy-
		friend and cutting his heart out.

				MEAGAN
		Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
		already dead when I cut his heart
		out!

	Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing; manic)
		Goddamnit, you don't understand!
		Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

	Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
	the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

				MURDOCH
		I know how you must feel... I had
		a dog once. I loved that dog. I
		treated her like my own daughter.
		We went camping, picnics in the
		park... I even had a little stocking
		for her nailed up on the mantle for
		Christmas. Then one day, she bit
		me... so I had to blow her brains
		out.
			(sighs)
		God, I loved that dog.


	INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

	Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
	knife.

	A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
	cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

				BOOGERMAN
		Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
		again -- gotta go!

	Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
	nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
	blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
	possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
	She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
	ahead.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Well, excuse me!

	INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
	his head.

	The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
	him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
	front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
	pulled out, kicking and screaming.

	Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
	closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
	twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
	man across the cell.

	Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
	ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
	flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
	his nasty head still alive in the center.

	Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
	extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
	the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
	he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
	Stormie's cell.

	Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
	right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
	of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
	clings to life deep inside the nostril.

	Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
	up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

				FREDDY
		Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

	Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
	with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
	cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
	screaming her head off.

	Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
	screams too.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

	As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
	hear a loud SPLAT!

				MEAGAN
		Stormie?!

	The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
	cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
	cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
	runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
	splattered with blood and bits.

	Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
	come running into the cellblock, answering the
	deputy's puke-choked scream.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Oh, God... what have I done? What
		have I done?!

	We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
	lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
	gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
	chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
	suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
	The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
	with a terrible SQUEAL.

	WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
	it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
	attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
	Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

				AMBULANCE DRIVER
		I'll go check it out. You stay here.

	The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
	road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
	carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
	the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
	it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
	He starts towards the ambulance.

	The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
	emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
	slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
	grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
	pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
	into the side of the ambulance.

	In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
	watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
	a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
	silence.

	RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
	and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
	weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
	eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

	Then... nothing.

	After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
	over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
	-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
	to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

				ERWIN
		You... want me to tell you where
		Meagan is?

	Again with the thrusting.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
		for a minute there I thought you
		were going to kill me.
			(then)
		You're not, are you?

	Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... okay! I'll take you right
		to her. Could you help me out of
		this?

	Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

	Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
	behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		I'll drive.

	Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
	the passenger side door.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... you drive.

	As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
	off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Fasten your safety belt, please.

	Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
	safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
	Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
	The CHIME goes crazy.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			(continuing)
		Fasten your safety belt, please...
		Fasten your safety belt, please...

	Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
	the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
	to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

				ERWIN
		Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

	With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
	ambulance roars away into the early morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

	Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
	as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
	to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
	she switches on the cellblock TV.

	ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
	is on.

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
		-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
		And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
		Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

	A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
	studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Good morning, friends... the Good
		Book says that each morning brings
		a new light into our lives...

	The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
	before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
	answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
	-- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
	commercial comes on:

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		You can own a videotape of Reverend
		Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
		$19.95...

					  CUT TO:

	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

	In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
	as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
	hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

				GATE GUARD
		Hello. What can I do for you?

	A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

				CULTIST
		We're here to see the Reverend
		Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
		wedding.

				GATE GUARD
		Do you have an appointment?

				CULTIST
		No. I have a Beretta.

	The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


	INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

	The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
	organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
	The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

	BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
	OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
	Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
	wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

	The cultists break into the control room, killing the
	DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
	garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
	Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
	All the feed monitors go snowy.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
	the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

				MEAGAN
		Something just happened at the TV
		station.

				DEPUTY
		Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

				MEAGAN
		What for?

				DEPUTY
		Time to get you cleaned up for court.

	Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
	get undressed.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
	a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
	are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
	skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
	dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
	side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
	shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
	catcall.

	Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
	to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
	over to Meagan and says:

				HEAD BITCH
		What's the matter, honey... you
		don't like our company?

				MEAGAN
		I like you... sure. It's just that
		I usually shower alone, that's all.

				HEAD BITCH
		Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
		they're shy...

	The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
	bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
	as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Don't fight it, baby! You know you
		want me...

	Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
	off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
	spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
	produces a shiv.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		If you won't give me a piece then
		I'll just cut one for myself...

	The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
	step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
	holds up her hands.

				MEAGAN
		Wait a second... I didn't mean to
		do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
		you come on a little strong, that's
		all. Just give me a little time to
		adjust to my new surroundings...

	The head bitch stops, curious.

				HEAD BITCH
		Are you saying you want me now?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I want you.

				HEAD BITCH
		Prove it.

	Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
	flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
	-- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
	the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
	long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
	bitch smiles.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Now that's more like it!
			(to the others)
		Hey, this bitch is alright!

	The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
	arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		You're okay, honey... what's your
		name?

				MEAGAN
		Meagan.

				HEAD BITCH
		So... what're you in for, Meagan?

				MEAGAN
			(sniffles a little)
		Oh, my friend...

				HEAD BITCH
		The bitch that died last night?

				MEAGAN
			(starts to cry)
		Yeah... they said she had some
		disease that made her... explode!
		Oh, God! Please hold me!

	The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
	smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
	of concern as one asks:

				BITCH #1
		What's this bullshit about some
		killer funk make you explode?

				HEAD BITCH
			(to Meagan)
		Easy... honey. It's goin' be
		alright. But what I asked you is
		why you're in here?

				MEAGAN
		Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
		think I gave it to her...

	The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
	were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
	but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
	the bitches race for the exit.

	The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
	shouts:

				DEPUTY
		What the hell is all the screaming
		about?!

	WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
	from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
	running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
	After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
	drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

	The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
	through the station.  Several deputies chase after
	them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
	ensues.  Chaos.

	Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
	up at the madness and mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks...


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
	on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
	The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
	head with her baton and she falls to the side,
	revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
	uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

	The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
	sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
	her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
	leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
	face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

	On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
	charging into the showers to restore order.  She
	gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
	to freedom.


	EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
	up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
	pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
	and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

				JUNIOR TROOPER
		Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

					 CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
	shakes his head, saying:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		I won't do it! It's a sin!
		Blasphemy!

	One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

				CULTIST
		Wedding or funeral... your choice.

	The reverend swallows and says:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And who would be the bride?

	Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
	and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
	lulls around as she chants softly:

				LIZZY
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
	needle from one to another.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Three... four... Better lock your
		door.

	The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
	throat.  He shudders and asks:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And the groom.

				CULTIST
		He's coming...

	Lizzy is almost asleep.

				LIZZY
		Five... six... grab your crucifix...

	The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
	Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
	falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
	an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
	the curtains on FIRE.

	As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
	appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
	leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
	to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

				FREDDY
		That's for the lift sister!
			(to the cultists)
		Hiya, kids!

				CULTISTS
			(in unison)
		Hiya, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Ready to get hitched?

				CULTISTS
		Ready, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Then let's do it!

	Lizzy looks up and smiles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Freddy...

					  CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

	A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

				DEPUTY
		We found your patrol car, Captain.
		It was abandoned near a local
		religious station.

				MURDOCH
		Religious station? Is there a
		padre there?

				DEPUTY
		Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
		casts out of that location.

				MURDOCH
		So that's where they're hiding.

					  CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		...and if there be anyone among you
		who has any reason why these two
		should not be joined in holy...

	Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
			(continuing)
		...in matrimony. Let them speak
		now...
			(under his breath)
		...please God...
			(aloud)
		...or forever hold their peace.

	WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

				MEAGAN
		Stop!

	Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing;
				 to Freddy)
		Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

				FREDDY
		You're a virgin?!

				MEAGAN
		Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

	Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
	around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

				FREDDY
		Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
		than your retard sister... okay,
		you've got the job.
			(to cultists)
		Get her ready.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

	Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
	station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
	the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
	out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
	and says:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
		State Trooper. I'm giving you until
		the count of three to come out with
		your hands up...

	A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
	hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
	other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
	calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Hand me that flare pistol.

	The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Good idea. Throw a little light on
		them -- see if we can spot their
		firing positions...

	As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
	carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
	to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
	He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
	screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
	commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright, now I'm through playing
		"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
		you punks to come out right now
		with your hands up.

	The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
	-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
	and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
	EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

	The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
	dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
	beside Freddy.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

	As the battle outside between the cultists and the
	cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
	down behind a fender to reload.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Well, it doesn't look like they're
		going to surrender.

				MURDOCH
		What we're going to need then is
		somebody to charge their lines --
		make a hole for us to slip in.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Where are you going to find anyone
		that crazy?

	Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
	police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

				MURDOCH
		Here comes one now...
			(yells)
		GO GIT 'EM, SON!

	Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
	Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
	side window as the ambulance zooms past.

	Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
	the ambulance.

	The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
	SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
	through the front gate.

	Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
	the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

				ERWIN
		That was easy enough...

	Erwin looks ahead and screams.

	ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
	directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
	machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
	ducks down.

	Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
	ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
	into the side of the station with a CRASH.

	Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
	cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
	smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
	machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
	the cultist just in time.

	As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
	greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
	OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
	punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
	Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
	Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
	towards the front door.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The wedding proceeds...

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Once again... if there be anyone
		among you who does not want these
		two people to be joined... let him
		speak now or forever hold his peace.

	Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
	reverend clears his throat to continue when...

	WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
	in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

				FREDDY
		Uh, oh...

	The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
	one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
	a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
	idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
	machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
	as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
	on the other side start POUNDING.

	Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
	slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
	it falls to the floor.

	Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
	behind him.

	Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
	wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
	looks up and says:

				ERWIN
		I can't wake them up. Freddy's
		got them trapped!

	Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
	couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
	Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
	of dream dope.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Go get him, boy!

	Jason staggers forward, falling into...


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
	entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
	head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
	the LIVING DEAD.

	Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
	shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

	Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
	boxing gloves.

	TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

				TED BUNDY
			(into microphone)
		Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
		to the fight of the century! I'm
		your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

	BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
	BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
	and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
	back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
	calls into the balcony:

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

	ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
	smoking.

				OSWALD
			(angry; defensive)
		It wasn't me!

	Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

				TED BUNDY
		In my left corner, weighing in at
		only ninety seven pounds... the
		nightmare master himself! The one!
		The only... Freddddddddy
		Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

	Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And on my right... weighing in at
		a whopping four hundred and thir-
		teen pounds... that killer of
		countless teenagers... the big
		guy...
			(gestures to Jason)
		Jason Voorhees!

	CHEERS and BOOS.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And the prize tonight... not one but
		TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
		ripe for the picking.

	Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
	Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Hey, have one now and save the other
		for the ride home. That's what I did.

	LAUGHTER from the crowd.

				MEAGAN
		Kick his ass, Jason!

	DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

	Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
	blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
	glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
	RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

	Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
	axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
	over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
	her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

				BLOODY MARY
		HEY!

	Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
	OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
	down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
	and shrugs:

				FREDDY
		Oh, well... I just axed for that!

	Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
	Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
	axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
	between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
	turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

				HITLER
		Peasants...

	DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
	into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
	his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
	starts in:

				HUMAN HEAD
		That's it, kiddo! You're really
		giving it to him out there! Use the
		left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
		That's the ticket to a knockout!

	Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
	the studio door.


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

	DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
	Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
	each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
	Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
	a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
	OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
	CHEERS.

	Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
	opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
	decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
	of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

	Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
	disgust.

	Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
	high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
	to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

	Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
	Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
	can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
	opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
	and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
	his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
	chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
	heavy metal boxing glove.

	Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
	massive glove for a blow.

	CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
	glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
	He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

	As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
	around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
	into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
	see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
	Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

	>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! Get up! Get up!

	ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
	water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
	up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
	wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

	Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
	Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
	the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jason! You've got to get up!

	JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
	him down... drowning him...

						  FLASH CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
	to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

	Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
	his killer comes into sharp focus.

	It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
	reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
	Jason down again, laughing.

						  HARD CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

	Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
	mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
	of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
	mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
	him up with him.

	Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
	ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


	INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
	he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
	the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
	pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
	real world.

				FREDDY
		Oh, shit!

	Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
	boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
	tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

	Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
	They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
	suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
	-- dead.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

	The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
	police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
	heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
	sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

				MURDOCH
		Now's my chance... give me sixty
		seconds to get in there then move
		in.

	Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
	running into the station.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
	and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

				MEAGAN
		What took you so long?!

	Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
	so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

				ERWIN
		What ever you do... don't let this
		guy drive.

	Meagan smiles at Jason.

				MEAGAN
		I knew you would come...

	Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
	fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
	scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

	The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
	then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
	disappear.

	In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
	monitor, laughing.

				ERWIN
		Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

	Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
	from the control room via a long thick cable running
	overhead.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		He's going for the satellite dish!
		If he uplinks with a communications
		satellite he can beam himself any-
		where in the world! We'll never be
		rid of him!

	Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
	past them, going through the ceiling to the...


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
	to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
	ready to beam Freddy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
	hard.


	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
	BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


	EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

	The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
	off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
	tumbling into deep space.

	The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

	Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
	and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
	skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
	One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

	ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
	solar prominence.


	INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
	a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
	dust billows up.

	Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
	Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
	this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

				ERWIN
		No! Wait!

	Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
	the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
	run to his side.

	Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
	chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
	out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin? Erwin?!

				MURDOCH
		He's dead... and so are you if you
		don't put your hands up right now!

	Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
	the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
	as he says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		It's time I taught you girls some
		respect for the law!

	In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
	cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

	PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
	SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
	large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
	turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		So... you wanna be a punk?

	Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Then die like a punk!

	Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
	hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
	jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
	pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
	with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
	see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

	As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
	hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
	of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
	muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
	the shotgun and...

	BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
	his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
	of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
	metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
	spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

	Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
	floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
	come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
	guns in panic.

				MEAGAN
		NO!

	Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
	FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
	grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
	past.

	More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
	start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
	is crowded with muzzle flash.

	More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
	hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

	The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
	up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

	VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
	opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
	passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
	cops in the studio.

	Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
	off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
	to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
	of his chest and head.

	Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
	SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
	the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
	gunsmoke in the room.

	As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
	then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

	Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
	reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
	pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

	Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
	rolls back -- he's dead.

	Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
	revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
	Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
	turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

				LIZZY
		You forgot to check under the bed.

	Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
	-- nada.

				MEAGAN
		No monsters here.

				LIZZY
		But what if they come back?

				MEAGAN
		Then we'll just have to kick their
		ass again.

	Lizzy giggles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		I love you too. Go to sleep.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
	to her from the bottom of the staircase.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Meagan?

	Meagan looks down at her parents.

				MEAGAN
		Yes, dad?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mom and I... well, we want to
		thank you for saving your sister's
		life... we know you went through
		a lot.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're going to be there for you
		from now on... for both of you!
		And that nice lawyer we hired for
		you said he thinks he can get all
		the charges dropped... except maybe
		for the grave robbing and human
		desecration ones.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Everything is going to be fine.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And I'm going to get sober...

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		We're going to be a normal, happy
		family again.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

				MEAGAN
		Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Goodnight, Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
	when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

				MEAGAN
		Hello?

				FREDDY
			(filtered)
		I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

	Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
	licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
	phone down.

				MEAGAN
			(sighs)
		I know...

	Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
	climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
	the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
	and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

					 BLACKNESS:

	The phone RINGS.

	ROLL END CREDITS:

	Then... at the very end...

					 CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

	Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
	the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
	when they went back to reality... waiting.

	Finally, somebody says:

				MONSTER
		I don't think they're coming back.

				TED BUNDY
		Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
		body can go home now.

	All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

	BLACK... now it's over.

				THE END
NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

				by Lewis Abernathy


	FADE IN:

	EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

	MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
	Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
	The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(in chorus)
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
	lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
	Elm Street 1 & 2).

	Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
	house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
	children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
	and jumprope on the front walk.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Three... four... better lock your
		door.

	Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
	"4" drawn on concrete.

	Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
	from Nightmare 3 & 4).

	Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
	little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
	peeling away.

	Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
	it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
	porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Five... six...

	RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

	The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
	we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
	find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
	nighttime.

	The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
	stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
	back to the little girl.

	But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
	remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
	and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
	it into the...


	INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
	cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
	Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
	tries to open it -- locked.

	Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
	trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
	GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy?

	Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
	following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
	belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
	end of the hallway, moving into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

	On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
	old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
	draws with crayons.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy. What are you doing here?

				LIZZY
		Playing with my friend.

	Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
	of Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		Your friend?

				LIZZY
		He lives under the bed.

	Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
	Lizzy's bed.

	Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
	the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
	the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
	tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		You scared him...

	Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

				MEAGAN
		I scared him?

	But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Lizzy?

	Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
	in the...


	INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
	a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
	goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
	-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
	all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
	down.

	The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
	Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

	Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

				FREDDY
		Where ya been all my death, baby?

	Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
	tuxedo, crooning:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've been waitin' at the altar for
		a long, long time!

	Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
	spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
	filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
	of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
	asks:

				SATANIC PRIEST
		Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

	Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
	dressed in body bags.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		And the groomsmen...?

	Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
	trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		If anyone here believes that these
		two should not be joined in unholy
		matrimony, let him speak now or
		forever rot in hell...

	>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

				JESSE
		Meagan!

	Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
	in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
	outstretched.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
	encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
	eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

	It's Jason.

	Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
	it down between her eyes...

						TRANSITION CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
	was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
	dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
	on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
	a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
	with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
	she notices something not quite right about the doll.
	She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
	a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy...

	Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

				FREDDY DOLL
		Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

	The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
	thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

	Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
	She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
	Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
	dream.

	ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
	with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
	pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
	out of bed...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
	her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
	tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
	glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
	head.

				MEAGAN
		Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
		up.

	Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
	then frowns.

				LIZZY
		I had a bad dream.

				MEAGAN
		Me, too.

				LIZZY
		I was scared.

				MEAGAN
		Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

				LIZZY
		Promise?

				MEAGAN
		Promise.

	Lizzy hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		I'll never let anyone hurt you.


	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
	A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
	SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
	NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
	the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
	surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
	house.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(filtered)
		As the sun rises on yet another
		morning, still no end in sight for
		the standoff between police and the
		mysterious group known only as the
		"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
		house behind me just thirteen days
		ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
		away teenagers -- have managed to
		keep police at bay for almost two
		weeks while inside they take mind-
		altering narcotics in order to
		communicate with their god --
		Freddy.

	The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
	where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
	down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
	who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
	herself a cup and sits.

				MEAGAN
		Morning.

	Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
	looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
	just a little too cheerfully:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Morning, Meagan.

	Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
	father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
	Meagan's mom bellows:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
			(calls upstairs)
		Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
		is almost ready!

	Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
	into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

	ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

				NEWS REPORTER
		Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
		was released on a legal technicality
		but later burned to death at the
		hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
		parents.  Some years later, a rash
		of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
		age deaths began leaving many in
		the area to wonder... is Freddy
		really dead?

	Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
	breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
	pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
	family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
	Tart, whining.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Hurry up and eat. You don't want
		to be late for special school.

				MEAGAN
		Mom! Don't call it that!

				LIZZY
		I hate that school. The other kids
		are mean... and they're all re-
		tard-ed!

	Meagan snickers.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We don't use that word. They're
		"special" children just like you're
		"special".

	Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
	Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
	the paper.

	ANGLE ON TV --

				NEWS REPORTER
		The cult members have declined to
		an on-camera interview but did send
		out a note with a message. The note
		-- which, by the way, appears to
		have been written in blood -- reads...
			(reads the note)
		To the parents of Springwood --
		Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
		take one of your children as his
		virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
		and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
		-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
		shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
		to rise and rule the darkness forever
		and ever.

	A horn TOOTS outside.

				MEAGAN
		That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

	Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
	dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Oh, look at the time! I've got to
		be going... anyone need me to bring
		anything home tonight?

				MEAGAN
		I need an alarm clock.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		What's wrong with your old one?

				MEAGAN
		Broke.

	Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
	door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're almost out of vodka.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

				JESSE
		Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

				MEAGAN
		My mom...

				JESSE
		And...?

				MEAGAN
		I had another dream last night...

				JESSE
		Was I naked?

				MEAGAN
		No. You were Jason.

				JESSE
		Jason? Oh, yeech...
			(then)
		Was I any good?

	Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


	INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
	his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
	say something.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Do you have to watch that crap all
		the time? Months and months of the
		O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

	Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
	slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
	then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
	into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
	switches the set back on.

	CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
	RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

				NEWS REPORTER
		I'm standing here with State Trooper
		Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
		Governor has called in to deal with
		the cultists because of his past
		experience with occult-style
		murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
		is the only law enforcement officer
		ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
		with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
		killer -- Jason Voorhees.
			(to Murdoch)
		You received some pretty nasty
		injuries in your battle with Jason,
		didn't you, Captain?

				MURDOCH
		Nothing serious... just a few
		stitches.

				NEWS REPORTER
		What about these so called "Freddy"
		cultists? They seem like pretty
		tough customers. Think you'll have
		any trouble getting them out of
		there?

				MURDOCH
		No. Now that the Governor has given
		me complete authority to deal with
		these punks I should be putting an
		end to their situation pretty quick.
		Unless of course their attorney is
		able to get them to come out peace-
		fully... but I don't hold out much
		hope for that.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(to camera)
		Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
		gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
		criminals.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
	to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

				MURDOCH
		Damn media... oughtta be a law.
			(gestures to house)
		Is that shyster still in there
		trying to talk them out?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... he's making them some kind
		of deal.

				MURDOCH
		Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
		assholes. Shakespeare was right --
		kill all the lawyers. Then we could
		kill all the punks with no hassles
		and the world would be a safer place.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Smaller anyway.

				MURDOCH
		Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
		Long-haired, English freak. He was
		probably a punk.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

	Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
	is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
	He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
	punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
	They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
	flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
	disfigured faces.

	The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
	takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
	neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
	his nose nervously as he speaks:

				SLEAZY LAWYER
		So, as I explained to you before,
		the revenues between the TV movie
		deal and the book sale should be
		adequate to fund your joint-defense.
		And I think with my mass media
		hypnosis argument I could get each
		of you a reduced sentence on appeal
		-- say... twenty years each. Out
		in fifteen with good behavior?
		Hmmmmm?

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
	an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
	windshield with a loud SPLAT!

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Jesus Christ!

	Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
	the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
	.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
	the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
	SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

	The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
	of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
	S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
	with foil, the walls have been painted black with
	cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
	black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
	night vision goggles and starts moving through the
	house.

	P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
	team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
	the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
	light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
	face.

	Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
	team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
	guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
	opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
	a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
	starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
	a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
	his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
	have been shredded to the bone.

	Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
	steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
	swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
	His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
	gun.

	The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
	bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
	the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
	room behind them.

	CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
	covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
	both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
	The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
	barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
	the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

	Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
	He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
	cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
	the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

				MURDOCH
		Freeze!

	Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

	The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
	retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
	cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
	guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
	thunder down a back staircase to the...


	INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
	house and most escape through the underground tunnel
	just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
	the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
	is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
	S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hold your fire!

	He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
	flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
	smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
	to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
	-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
	ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Help me, mister... please.

	The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
	down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
	tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
	timer.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hang on, honey... I'll have you
		out of there in a second.

	Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
	passageway and says:

				MURDOCH
		Looks like we'll have to hunt the
		rest of them down. Let's go before
		they get too far.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		We can't leave! Can't you see
		we've got a situation here?

	Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

				MURDOCH
		Leave her.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You're crazy! I can't just leave
		her!

				MURDOCH
		Forget it. I've seen this before.
		There's nothing you can do.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I've got to try...

	The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
	to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
	23... 22...

	The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
	of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
	team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

				MURDOCH
		You're wasting your time.

	The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
	second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
	13...

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Fuck it!

	The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
	and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
	in his arms as he shouts to his men:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing; yelling)
		CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

	The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
	bringing up the rear.


	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
	girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
	and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
	the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
	-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

	Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
	mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks.

	As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
	the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Are you okay, honey?

	Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
	commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Freddy lives!

	With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
	commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
	his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
	He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
	takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
	style.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		NO!

	The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
	time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
	dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing)
		Jesus... you were going to kill
		that kid, weren't you?

				MURDOCH
		I told you you were wasting your
		time. Once these kids go rabid,
		best thing to do is put 'em down.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You can't be serious...

				MURDOCH
		Dead serious. See... the world is
		made up of rules. Kids don't like
		rules. They rebel for a while, but
		ultimately they start to fall in
		line and become ordinary Joe's like
		you and me. But some kids... dope
		smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
		Satanic lyrics melting what's left
		of their brains... these kids grow
		up to be punks. And when these punks
		step as far over the line as these
		"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
		peace officers have no choice but
		to kill them.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I didn't become a peace officer to
		kill kids.

				MURDOCH
		Punks. There's a difference...
			(under his breath)
		...barely.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
	LIVES!

	We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
	it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
	instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

				MISS KREPPS
		(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

	It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
	struggling to stay awake while others have already
	passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
	She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
	in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
	fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
	on:

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

	Meagan starts to drift off, when...

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing; loud)
		Meagan!?

				MEAGAN
		Yes, ma'am?

				MISS KREPPS
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your oral report?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I'm ready.

				MISS KREPPS
		Please come up here to the podium.

	Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
	snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
	snaps her fingers for quiet.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		You won't think it's funny when
		you haven't learned the fundamentals
		of a free market economy... oh,
		why do I waste my breath? You're
		all going to grow up to be gas
		station attendants and waitresses
		anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		My report is on Global Economic
		Trends.
			(clears throat;
				 begins reading)
		Try and think of a world where there
		is no poverty... no sickness... no
		crime. A world where everyone is
		happy to be alive and everyone lives
		together in peace. This is my dream.

	The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
	BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
	with her report.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		This dream is becoming a reality
		with ever-growing international
		business...

	CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
	turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
	louder.

				MISS KREPPS
		Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

	Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
	voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
	report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
	WIND increases.

	A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
	spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
	to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
	it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
	billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
	with laughter.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		Louder, Meagan... we still can't
		hear you.

	But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
	busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
	the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
	over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
	blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
	that too is swept off.

	Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
	to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
	naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
	face.

	Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
	all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
	in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
	wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

				FREDDY
		Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
		to blow!

	Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
	of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
	pleading:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse... please, help me.

	But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
	up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
	expressionless face.

				FREDDY
		Looks like a photo opportunity to
		me!

	Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
	flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
	beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
	front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
	sneers:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Say... cheesecake!

	PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
	light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
	against the blackboard -- vaporized!

					HARD CUT TO:

	Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
	as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

				MISS KREPPS
		Meagan? Meagan?!

	Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your report?

	Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
	herself together.

				MEAGAN
		Sure...

	Meagan stands up and faints.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

	MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
	standing over her.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
		know where you are?

	Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

				MEAGAN
		I was day dreaming and then I woke
		up but then it was like I was still
		dreaming and then I woke up and
		then I guess I fainted and now I'm
		awake again...

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Are you sure?

	Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(continuing)
		Meagan?

				MEAGAN
		I'm waiting to see if you're going
		to turn into Freddy.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Freddy... I see. You've been watching
		too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
		cult thing -- it's all over the TV
		day and night -- you can't get away
		from it. No wonder you kids are all
		having nightmares.

				MEAGAN
		But this one was different... it
		felt real.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
		aren't real. They're just broken
		fragments of the subconscious mind.

				MEAGAN
		Fear is real though, isn't it? And
		if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
		that make them real?!
			(gets excited)
		And if the nightmares are real then
		is reality like a dream?!

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(cutting her off)
		Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
		that's all.

	The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
	nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

				MEAGAN
		Old witch... what does she know?
		She isn't even qualified to give a
		shot and she's telling me that my
		dreams aren't anything to worry
		about.

				JESSE
		So she said you were okay?

				MEAGAN
		Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
		says it's just a case of heat pro-
		stration and an overdose of TV news.
		Ruined my makeup, too.

				JESSE
		So you're going back to class?

				MEAGAN
		No. She gave me last period off.

				JESSE
		Well, what are you bitching about?
		I could have a compound fracture of
		the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
		from P.E.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! I've been having nightmares
		for almost two weeks now and they
		keep getting worse! Now I'm having
		daymares! I want to know why!

				JESSE
		Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
		it was heat probation?

	Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

				MEAGAN
		You don't understand... I want to
		know more about dreams. What they
		mean... why we have them.

				JESSE
		Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
		got the rest of the day off, that's
		all I'm saying.

				MEAGAN
		That's a good idea. Why don't you
		cut last period and come with me?

				JESSE
		Sure. Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				JESSE
		You want me to cut school so we can
		go to the library?

					   CUT TO:

	INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

	Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
	the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Find anything?

	Jesse looks up suddenly.

				JESSE
		What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

	Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
	TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Did you know that our sub-conscious
		retains everything that ever happened
		to us? Everything. From the time
		we're born until we die.

				JESSE
		Really?

				MEAGAN
		That's how Freddy gets at us...
		by using our sub-conscious fears.
		Fears our conscious minds have
		repressed or forgotten.

				JESSE
		I've got a news flash for you...
		Freddy's dead.

				MEAGAN
		I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
		in our sub-conscious then he can
		never be fully erased. Like a bad
		memory... you may blot it out of
		your mind but it will alway be
		hiding someplace in your dreams.
			(off Jesse's
				 disbelieving stare)
		Weren't you scared as a child by
		something so stupid that you're
		ashamed to admit it?

				JESSE
		No.

				MEAGAN
		No?

				JESSE
		Well, yeah.

				MEAGAN
		Well, what? What is it?

				JESSE
		Well... when I was kid, my brother
		took me to the carnival. And in the
		penny arcade there was this robot
		gunslinger...

				MEAGAN
		Black Bart.

				JESSE
		You know about Black Bart?

				MEAGAN
		Duh. You put your quarter in and he
		says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
		And then you pull your gun out and
		shoot him.

				JESSE
		That's just it -- I never could!
		I'd point the gun right at him and
		shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
		So I always got killed.

				MEAGAN
		No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

				JESSE
		Scared the shit out of me.

	Meagan tries to hide her smile.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 flustered)
		Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
		kid?

	Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 mad)
		Okay, smartass... what about you?
		What scared you the most as a kid?

	A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

				MEAGAN
		I remember... Lizzy wandered off
		one day and we couldn't find her.
		The police came and everything. I
		wasn't really worried until I saw
		her picture on TV... then I got
		really scared.
			(then)
		Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
		think something bad's going to
		happen.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
	her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
	her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
	disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

				LEONARD
		You're stupid!

				LIZZY
		No, you are!

				LEONARD
		They forgot you again!

				LIZZY
		No, they didn't!

				LEONARD
		Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
		to wait out here until it's dark
		and then the monsters are goin'
		come and get you!

				LIZZY
		No they won't, because I'm walkin'
		home!

	Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
	calls after her:

				LEONARD
		Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
		me! I got forgot too, you know!

	Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
	yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
	bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
	down as he follows after Lizzy.

				LEONARD
			(continuing)
		Okay... I'm going to have to report
		this!

	Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
	she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
	standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
	Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
	glances back, the figure is still standing... but
	closer.

	Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
	she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
	street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
	of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
	reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

	The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
	it roars off down the street.

	CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
	in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
	car and rushes inside.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
	calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
	Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Didn't you get my message?

				MEAGAN
		What message?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		I called the school after lunch...
		I had to stay late after work...
		I...

	Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
	she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
	drunk and has been crying.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Don't you dare blame this on her,
		you sorry bastard! It's all your
		fault!
			(to Meagan)
		Where have you been anyway?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		A likely Goddamn story!

	Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

				MEAGAN
		Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
		Where's Lizzy?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		She didn't come home from school
		today. The police got a report that
		a girl fitting Lizzy's description
		was forced into a car by some
		crazies. They're pretty sure it was
		this "Freddy" cult.

				MEAGAN
			(shocked)
		Oh, my God...

	Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
	comfort her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Now don't worry. The police are
		doing everything they can.

	Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
	men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

				TROOPER
			(O.S.)
		Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
		up here!


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

	As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
	the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
	the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
	attention to the floor next to the bed.

	Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
	including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
	the top.

	Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

				TROOPER
		Looks like she was in the cult all
		along.

				MEAGAN
		No... no, she wouldn't do that!
		Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

				TROOPER
		I know it's hard to believe, miss.
		But a lot of good kids get caught
		up in this kind of trouble.

	Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
	tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
	little unicorn.

				MURDOCH
		Punks...

	Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
	the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Captain Murdoch... is there any-
		thing we can do?

				MURDOCH
		You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
		daughter before... well, before it's
		too late. But rest assured, if I
		can't persuade her to come back to
		her loving home, then I'll do what's
		best for her. I know you and your
		wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
			(to his men)
		Come on... I want to go talk to
		Erwin.

	Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
	Jesse out of the house.

				JESSE
		Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		Over to Stormie's.

				JESSE
		Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
		friends anymore since she stole that
		twenty dollars from you.

				MEAGAN
		That was her "klepto" phase... when
		she was dating that gang member.
		She dumped him a long time ago.

				JESSE
		I still don't understand. What has
		she got to do with Lizzy missing?

				MEAGAN
		She used to be in the Freddy cult.
		Maybe she knows where they took
		Lizzy.

	They exit to Jesse's car.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
	blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

				STORMIE
		If I did know I would call the
		police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
		No telling what those freaks will
		do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
		are hard core.

				JESSE
		I thought you were in the cult?

				STORMIE
		I was in the cult for a week cause
		my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
		he was. But I just liked the music
		and the clothes... when they were
		clean, but not like the violence
		and stuff. But that was just my
		"cult" phase... but I got past that.
		You know, just like my "gang" phase
		when I was dating Ramon and then
		before that was my "death rock"
		phase when I was dating Stuart...

				JESSE
		Uh, excuse me... but what phase
		are we in now?

				STORMIE
		Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
		what's it fuckin' to ya?!

				JESSE
			(to Meagan)
		Why don't you just let the cops find
		her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
		knows how to deal with these cultist
		psychos. He was the man who got Jason
		Voorhees.

				MEAGAN
		That guy in my dreams...

				STORMIE
		Jason kicked his ass.

						   QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

	Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
	younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
	Jason in panic.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
		thirteen bullets in Jason before
		he hacked his head open.

	Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
	staggers back, raising his pistol.

				JESSE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		But even with his head hacked open
		and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
		still managed to put his last bullet
		in Jason's eye.

	Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
	Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
	body hits the ground.


	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

	Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
	Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
	medical contraptions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
		worked at the hospital where they
		took him. He said that Murdoch lost
		more than half his brain and what
		little that was left was all twisted
		up inside. And they had to replace
		his skull with a metal plate to
		keep that from leaking out.

	In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
	eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		They say he hasn't been the same
		since.

					CUT BACK TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

				JESSE
		So what's different about him?

				STORMIE
		One thing... he used to be a
		Democrat. Now he votes straight
		Republican.

				MEAGAN
		I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
		cult or something.

				STORMIE
		Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

				MEAGAN
		I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
		got to find her and save her from
		Freddy before that crazy cop kills
		her.

				JESSE
		Just where are you going to look?
		I mean, these cult guys could be
		holding her anywhere.

				MEAGAN
		Murdoch said something about going
		to talk to somebody named Erwin.

				STORMIE
		Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
		Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
		they took Lizzy!

				JESSE
		Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
		that used to eat bugs?

				STORMIE
			(annoyed)
		Who else?
			(to Meagan; bright)
		Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
		home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
		up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
		Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
		back and the cops put him away for
		his own safety. They say Freddy's
		put a death hex on Erwin.

				JESSE
		A death hex?

				STORMIE
		Yes, a death hex. You know... where
		someone wants you dead!

				MEAGAN
		Where is he?

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

	Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
	and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
	park, Meagan turns to him and says:

				MEAGAN
		I want you to stay here.

				JESSE
		Why?

				MEAGAN
		Don't be mad... it's just that you
		might scare him.

				JESSE
		Scare him?

				STORMIE
		What she's subtly trying to tell
		you is that this needs a woman's
		gentle touch... butthead.

				MEAGAN
		Just stay here... okay?

	Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
	cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
	turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
	the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
	row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
	on the glass.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
		of visitors. Now be a good boy...
			(to Meagan & Stormie)
		You've got five minutes. I'll be
		right down the hall if you need me.

	The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
	thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
	They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
	little closer to the glass.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin...?

	SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
	face to the glass as he screams:

				ERWIN
		SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

	Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
	quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
	inspection.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Where do you shoot?

				MEAGAN
		Shoot?

				STORMIE
		He's talking about dream dope --
		the stuff the cultists shoot up
		with so they can talk to Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		I don't do drugs.

				ERWIN
		You're not in the cult?

				MEAGAN
		No.

				ERWIN
		Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

				MEAGAN/STORMIE
		No.

				ERWIN
		I don't trust you... better take off
		your clothes so I can check you for
		tracks.

				STORMIE
		Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
		hard data -- not a floppy disk.

	Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
	to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
	mattress.

				ERWIN
		Well, what do you want? Can't you
		see I'm busy?

				MEAGAN
		Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

				STORMIE
		I told her you might know where
		they took her.

				ERWIN
		I already told the cops everything
		I know.

				MEAGAN
		Tell me... please.

				ERWIN
		Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
		but I've got my own problems with
		Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

				MEAGAN
		Then tell me why they took her...

				ERWIN
		To bear his child. Freddy wants to
		be human again. In order to do that
		he has to be "reborn".

				MEAGAN
		How can he do that?

				ERWIN
		He has to marry a virgin on holy
		ground. Then the cult consumate
		the marriage by impregnating her.

				STORMIE
		The whole cult? Yeech!

				ERWIN
		Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
		It's sort of a tradition with him.

				MEAGAN
		So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

				ERWIN
		And Freddy enters the soul of the
		fetus through a dream state. Voila!
		Rebirth.

	There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

				STORMIE
		That's the stupidest shit I ever
		heard.

				ERWIN
		Hey, they're not my rules... some-
		body else wrote 'em.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... you've got to help me find
		Lizzy. You're my only hope.

	Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

				ERWIN
		I'll help you find your sister, but
		you've got to help me.

				MEAGAN
		Anything. Just name it.

				ERWIN
		You have to help me kill Freddy.

	Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

				STORMIE
		But Freddy's dead.

				ERWIN
		Freddy lives...
			(looks at Meagan)
		If only in our dreams.

	Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
	her away.

				STORMIE
		Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
		is up. He's giving me the creeps.

	But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

				MEAGAN
		How can you kill a dream?

				ERWIN
		When it's not a dream.
			(then)
		Do we have a deal?

	Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
	thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
	over his.

				MEAGAN
		Deal.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
	a pay phone, arguing.

				JESSE
		No! I won't do it!

				MEAGAN
		Come on, Jesse! Please...?

				JESSE
		It's illegal! I could go to jail!

				STORMIE
		How will they ever know? Don't be
		such a pussy!

				JESSE
		Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

				STORMIE
		Okay, I will!

				MEAGAN
		No! They'll never believe her!

				STORMIE
		I can disguise my voice...
			(lowers voice)
		Hello, how do you do? My name is
		Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
		actually a wimp.

				MEAGAN
		They'll never believe that. Come
		on, Jesse... for me?

				JESSE
		Okay... okay... I'll do it.
			(to Stormie)
		And I'm not a wimp!

	Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
	moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
	both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
	the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
	girls shut up, he says:

				JESSE
			(continuing)
		I need a quarter for the phone.

	Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
	re-enters the booth.

	ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

	The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Springwood Mental Center... how
		can I help you?

				JESSE
			(filtered; disguising
				 his voice)
		There's a bomb planted in your
		building.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Who is this?

				JESSE
		If I were you -- I'd get my ass
		out of there.

	In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
	something to Jesse.

				JESSE
			(continuing; adding)
		Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

	CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

	The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
	fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
	into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
	files out with the others, still wearing his straight
	jacket.

	Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
	flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
	off towards the fence between himself and freedom
	when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

				SECURITY GUARD
		Hey, Erwin... where do you think
		you're going?

	Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

				SECURITY GUARD
			(continuing)
		I'm talking to you, asshole!

	Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
	him.

	In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
	guard closes the distance.

				JESSE
		He's not going to make it.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to do something!

	With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

	Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
	the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
	drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
	Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
	an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
	RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
	does a 180, and PEELS off.

	ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
	of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
	hand to Jesse.

				ERWIN
		Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
		busting me out of there!

	Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
	fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

				JESSE
		Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
		me one favor -- don't eat nothing
		disgusting. My stomach is tight
		enough as it is.

	The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
	puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
	street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
	plucks it out...

	Jesse's front license plate.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

	CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
	close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
	inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
	starts to settle down... falling asleep...

	The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
	her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

	LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
	the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
	gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


	INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
	a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
	is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
	of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
	with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
	hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
	terrible chorus of the damned.

	The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
	the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
	is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
	mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
	swings open as the cultists near.

	The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
	her tight as they push her face forward into the
	mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
	face disappearing into the mirror.

	ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
	face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
	thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
	darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
	the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
	moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
	out.

	The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
	locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
	things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
	the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
	releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

	The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
	the...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
	conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
	as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
	doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
	cultist thrusts under her.

	Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
	mouth -- the Dream Demons.


	EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

	Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
	pulls up next to a run-down building.


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
	old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
	towards the back, to a large table and a collection
	of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
	starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
	syringes laying scattered about the floor.

				ERWIN
		Damn! We must have just missed them!

	Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

				MEAGAN
		Oh, my God -- she was here! This
		is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
		torn!
			(grabs Erwin)
		Erwin... we've got to find her!

				ERWIN
		We're too late! There's no way...
		except...

				MEAGAN
		Except what?!

				ERWIN
		We could go after Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		How?

	Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
	up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
	he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
	box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
	and several pairs of cult shades.

				ERWIN
		We'll inject ourselves with Dream
		Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
		brings on a dreamlike state.

	Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
	approval.

				MEAGAN
		Okay... let's do it!

				JESSE
		Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
		what if one of us gets hooked or
		something?
			(whispers)
		We could turn out like him!

	Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry about it. We need you
		wide awake anyway.

				JESSE
		What for?

				ERWIN
		We're going to go under and try to
		find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
		him and bring him here. Then you
		kill him with this...

	Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

				JESSE
		This rusty chunk of shit? What
		good is this?

				ERWIN
		It's not the gun, it's what's in
		it -- silver bullets blessed by a
		priest.

				JESSE
		Will that work?

				ERWIN
			(shrugs)
		Should. But then...

				JESSE
			(finishes for him)
		You don't make the rules... yeah,
		yeah.

				MEAGAN
		What should we do?

				ERWIN
		Have a seat over there and make
		yourselves comfortable. Roll up
		your sleeves and put these on...

	Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
	sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
	Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

				STORMIE
		Oh, cool!

				MEAGAN
		What are they for?

				ERWIN
		It's how the cult keeps in constant
		contact with Freddy. The little
		lights flashing are a sustained
		occular input that causes your brain
		to resonate at approximately the
		same frequency at which the dream
		state is most likely to occur.

	All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

				STORMIE
		Whatever...
			(to Meagan; excited)
		Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

	Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
	up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
	chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
	takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
	lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
	glasses.

				ERWIN
		It helps to hold hands if you want
		to go together...

	Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
	watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
	a final warning:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		And remember... Freddy knows what
		scares you.

	Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

	INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
	(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
	The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

				ERWIN
		WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
	asleep in their chairs.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
	mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
	pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
	fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
	they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

				LIZZY
			(distant)
		Meagan... help me... please...

	Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
	suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
	and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

				ERWIN
		Freddy's trying to split us up...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
	mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
	and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
	the muzzle as he says:

				JESSE
		Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
		in Dreamland now.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
	boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
	stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
	of Erwin and Stormie.

				FREDDY
		Looking for some-body?

	Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
	lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
	Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
	to Erwin:

				STORMIE
		I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
		us up!

	But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

				FREDDY
		Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

	Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
	claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
	Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
	Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
	apron.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Stew on this, bitch!

	Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
	falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

				STORMIE
		Shoot him! Shoot him!

	Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Freddy turns toward Erwin.

				FREDDY
		Well, well, well... if it isn't
		my ol' pal, Erwin.

	Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've got something special in mind
		for you...

	Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
	out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
	his finger.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

				STORMIE
		You didn't help me, you pussy!
		I could've had him!
			(smacks him some more)
		You gutless... spinless... jelly
		fish!

	Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


	INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

	Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
	Lizzy's voice...

				LIZZY
			(V.O.)
		Meagan... help me... Meagan...

	It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
	door.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
	table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
	FREDDY LIVES!

				MEAGAN
		Daddy?

	He looks up and quietly shushes her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

	And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
	newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
	again... upstairs.

	As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
	her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
	looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
	to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
	mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

	Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
	for help draws her to...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
	covers.

				LIZZY
		Help me...

	Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
	pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
	her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
	it's way out.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Meagan...

	Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
	Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
	Meagan in the chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
	Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

				STORMIE
		Are you okay?

	They help Meagan to her feet.

				MEAGAN
			(shaky)
		He got away... I had him and he
		got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
		lost her...

				ERWIN
		Well, atleast you're not dead.

				MEAGAN
		No... I'm not dead...
			(realizes)
		No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

				STORMIE
		He killed me, too. But look...

	Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
	unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
	Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

				MEAGAN
		Now that I think about it -- he's
		killed me in all my nightmares. But
		I'm not dead... what does it mean?

				ERWIN
		It means we've still got some time
		left. Until his remains are host to
		the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
		hurt us.

				JESSE
		Hello. The Dream Demons...?

				ERWIN
		Freddy made a pact with Satan when
		he died... so Satan bestowed upon
		him the Dream Demons. They're the
		source of Freddy's power to manipulate
		our physical reality. Without them...
		he's powerless -- nothing more than
		a bad dream.
			(off Jesse's cynical
				 look)
		Hey, like I said... I don't make
		the rules.

				MEAGAN
		But we've still got a chance, right?
		A chance to kill Freddy before he
		gets back his power?

				ERWIN
		We already tried that. There's no
		way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
		clever. He knows how to get to us.

				MEAGAN
		Then let's get somebody else. Some-
		body strong.

				STORMIE
		Yeah! We could hire somebody to
		kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

				ERWIN
		You would have to hire a thousand
		of them... or one really big guy
		who isn't afraid of anything. No
		fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

				JESSE
		Where are you going to find a hit
		man? The yellow pages? In your
		dreams...

	Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
	bolt and she stammers out a name:

				MEAGAN
		Jason...

				JESSE
		Jason?

				MEAGAN
		Jason Voorhees...

				ERWIN
			(brightens)
		Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
		The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

				STORMIE
		Sounds like our man!

				JESSE
		Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
		isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

				ERWIN
		Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
		Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
		know how to bring him back to life.

				JESSE
		Somehow I just knew you would.

				ERWIN
		But that's not the problem. The
		problem is control. Once we bring
		Jason back from the dead... I'm not
		one hundred percent sure he'll do
		what we tell him.

				STORMIE
		Well, that's okay... as long as he
		doesn't chop us all up.

	Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
		so tell me the truth. Do you think
		if we do this -- if we go and get
		Jason and bring him back to life,
		that he could kill Freddy?

				ERWIN
		No doubt about. Jason could wreck
		Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
		But if Freddy has home court advan-
		tage... I don't know. Too close to
		call. The trick would be to get Jason
		to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
		and drag him out to our reality.

				MEAGAN
		I haven't got a choice. I've got to
		try something...
			(turns to Stormie &
				 Jesse)
		I can't ask either of you to help
		me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
		disgusting...

				STORMIE
		Hey, we sisters have to stand
		together, right? Where you lead --
		I'll follow. Count me in.

	Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
	He looks them over and sighs:

				JESSE
		Let me get this straight... we're
		going to go dig one dead maniac up
		to fight another dead maniac?

				ERWIN
		That's about the size of it... and
		I'd be doing you a disservice if I
		said there weren't a modicum of risk
		involved.

				JESSE
		Meagan... I don't want to do this...

				MEAGAN
		You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
		your fight. I understand.

				JESSE
		But I damn sure don't want you to
		do it without me. Count me in.

	Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
	she pushes him away.

				ERWIN
		Look out Freddy... here we come.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

	In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
	is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
	up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
	the radio.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
		What's matter, girl... you hear
		somethin'?

	Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
	closer.

	The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
	into the darkness when a line of several hearses
	approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
	the driver's window rolls down.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(continuing)
		What's this? A funeral procession?

	A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
	and says:

				CULTIST
		That's exactly what it is.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(suspicious)
		Yeah? Whose?

				CULTIST
		Yours.

	BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
	the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
	a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
	ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

	Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
	the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
	cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
	procession proceeds inside.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

	The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
	cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
	wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
	of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
	charred bones.

	Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
	and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
	around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
	with droopy eyes.

	LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
	the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
	Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
	more surreal as another cult member steps forward
	with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
	the funnel.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
	around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
	blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
	muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

	There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
	Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
	leaps out of the pit and cries:

				FREDDY
		Smokin'!

	Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
	FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
	building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
	them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
	reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		We're almost there...

				MEAGAN
			(V.O.)
		We should pull over and ask
		directions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		If it doesn't offend the men...
		ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Very funny.


	EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
	station.

				STORMIE
		I don't think they're open.

				MEAGAN
		It says, open all night.

	Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

				JESSE
		Hey! Can we get some service out
		here?!

				STORMIE
		I don't think there's anybody
		here...

	Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
	side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you kids want?

				MEAGAN
		We're looking for the old cemetery
		that's supposed to be around here...
		somewhere.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you want to know for?

				STORMIE
		We want to see it.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
		'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

				JESSE
		Look, mister... can you give us
		directions or not?

	The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
	over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
	Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
	under a baseball cap.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		You're not goin' up there to do
		somethin' stupid, are you?

				JESSE
			(laughs; nervous)
		Stupid? Like what?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
		that's what!

	Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
	busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
	their heads innocently in a big performance that
	wouldn't fool a stick.

				JESSE
			(looks at Meagan)
		Jesus... why would anyone do that?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		I dunno... but people do.

				STORMIE
		Been dug up a few times already,
		has he?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		More times than I care to remember.

				MEAGAN
		Well, we're just doing an article
		for our high school newspaper about
		the dangers of breaking into
		cemeteries at night. You know,
		stuff that can get you hurt...

	The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
	acquiesces.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well... okay... as long as you're
		not going up there to do something
		stupid.
			(pointing)
		Take this road up about a mile and
		make a left at the ol' saw mill.
		That road will take you right on
		in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
		can't miss it.

	Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
	ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
	PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
	WILL BE SHOT!

	Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
	cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
	shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
	Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		What's the story on Jason Voorhees
		anyway?

				STORMIE
		Where have you been? Jason was that
		guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
		chopping up camp counselors, duh?

				MEAGAN
		I knew that. What I mean was why?

				ERWIN
		It started a long time ago, back in
		the fifties, when Jason drown at
		Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
		berserk and started killing the
		counselors.

				STORMIE
		She got her head chopped off by one
		of the girls she was trying to kill!

				ERWIN
		Right. And then Jason came back from
		his watery grave to get revenge.

				JESSE
		He came back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
		before they finally caught up to him.

				MEAGAN
		What happened to him then?

				ERWIN
		They killed him.

				JESSE
		How can you kill somebody who's
		back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Not very well apparently. Jason
		keeps coming back to life and
		chopping people up. It's a never
		ending cycle of terror up here at
		Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

				MEAGAN
		Why does he keep coming back to
		life and killing people?

				ERWIN
		They say he's looking for revenge
		on the camp counselor who murdered
		him as a child. Jason just happens
		to go about it in the socially
		unacceptable way of hacking through
		every teenager he finds until he
		gets the right one.
			(spots grave)
		Here it is...

	Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

	ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
	Died:1953.

	Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
	stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

	Jesse and Erwin start digging.

	ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
	Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
	hits something solid.

	Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
	coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
	jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

	The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
	noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
	and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

	Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

	Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
	their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
	the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
	shirt, and calmly eats it.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
	holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
	hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
	tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
	taking anymore chances with bugs.

	Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
	at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
	-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
	mask.

					CUT TO:

	The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
	Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
	the lid closed.

	Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

	In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
	Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
	Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
	and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

				ERWIN
		Look... the boogerman!
			(laughs)
		Get it?!

	Stormie slaps his hand away.

				STORMIE
		Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
		Ug! I thought I had seen the last
		of those when my brother graduated
		third grade!

				ERWIN
		We just dug up a rotting corpse and
		you're worried about a little snot.

	Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
	beside him.  She purrs:

				MEAGAN
		I'm exhausted... wake me when we
		get back home.

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
		we've still got a lot of work to
		do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

	This news sobers everyone up immediately.

				STORMIE
		Well, that means we've all got to
		stay awake!

				JESSE
		Duh?!

				MEAGAN
		I know! We'll sing a song!
			(starts singing)
		Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
		the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream. Come
		on, everybody!

	Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
	chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
	the night.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
	to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

				MEAGAN
		...merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream.

	In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
	breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

	Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
	drooping.  The car starts to weave.

	ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
	a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
	FOR FOOD.

	Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
	on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

	Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
	board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
	out of the driver's window.

	CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
	ground, the red digits cascading up.

	Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
	the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
	his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

				FREDDY
		Shouldn't dream and drive.

	Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
	out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
	it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
	belching HELLFIRE.

	ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
	close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
	maremobile closing from behind fast.

	The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
	car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
	of the dozen of levers on the dash.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
	of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
	of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
	the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
	trunk lid opens.

	ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
	remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
	the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
	of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
	of the bag.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Looks like the cat's out of the
		bag now!

	Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

	The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
	car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
	all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
	startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
	nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

				MEAGAN
		It's Freddy!

	WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
	as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
	dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
	maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
	A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

	Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
	the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
	back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
	seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
	EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
	their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
	boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
	the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
	under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

	As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
	she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
	her legs.  Meagan screams.

	Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
	forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
	SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
	to swerve violently from side to side.

	Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

	CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
	up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
	into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
	Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
	CUTTING forward towards...

	CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
	it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
	road, veering into a tree line.

	CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
	the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

	Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
	overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
	EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

	In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
	on inside.

	The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
	ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
	door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
	embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
	around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
	is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
	Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
	Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
		to get him to a doctor.

	Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
	the farmer on the phone.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry... an ambulance is on
		the way.

	Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

				MEAGAN
		Oh, God... Jesse...

	Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
	garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
	untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

				ERWIN
		Meagan... listen to me... The cops
		are on their way. If they find me
		and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
		there, we're finished.

				MEAGAN
		Go... get out of here. Take Jason
		and Stormie with you.

				STORMIE
		I'm staying with you.

	Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

				ERWIN
		I'll call you at the hospital.

				STORMIE
		How?

				ERWIN
		Somehow!

	Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
	into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
	growing close.

					CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
	special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
	doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
	finishes, Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		Is he going to be okay?

				DOCTOR
		Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
		His leg is broken in four places
		and he has four broken ribs and a
		concussion.

	Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
	Stormie turns to the doctor.

				STORMIE
		Hey doc, is there someplace I
		could get us something to eat?

				DOCTOR
		I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
		There are some vending machines in
		the lobby.
			(to Meagan)
		I'll be back to check on him in a
		couple of hours.

	The doctor exits.

				STORMIE
		I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
		score us some munchies.

	Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
	head on Jesse's hand.


	INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
	the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
	at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
	and Erwin.

	Stormie dashes for the staircase.


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
	monitor BEEPS...

	On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
	peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
	ducks back down.

	Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
	and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

	Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
	onto the curtain.

	CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
	the rings.

	Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
	away.

	Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
	again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
	are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
	of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
	the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
	mattress.


	INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
	she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
	along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
	them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
	out into...


	EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
	in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
	and gunbelt.

	Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
	fear... staring at something coming down the street.

	It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

				FREDDY
			(ala John Wayne)
		Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
		ain't big enough for the two of
		us... draw!

	Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
	He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
	FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
	and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
	and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

	Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

				FREDDY
		Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
		you just go get [BEEP]


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
	wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


	INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

	Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
	empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
	gun you ever saw and says:

				FREDDY
		Go ahead... make my dream!

	Freddy FIRES!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
	Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
	flat line.  Jesse is dead.

	A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
	Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
	and screams.

	Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
	gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy killed Jesse...

	Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
	of the room.


	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
	the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

				STORMIE
		Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
		think a nurse in a hospital would
		have seen a dead body before.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse...

	Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
	off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
	come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
	Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
	and company go thundering past.

	Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
		please pick up the white paging
		phone for a message?

	Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
	announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
	Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
	and picks up the white paging phone.

				STORMIE
			(into phone)
		This is Stormie...

	Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
	station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
	Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

				MURDOCH
		Did you see a couple of girls go
		by here a moment ago?

	Stormie gestures to the elevators.

				STORMIE
		Just missed 'em.

	Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
	men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
	relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

				HOSPITAL OPERATOR
			(filtered)
		The message is from Erwin... he
		says to meet him at the side
		entrance in two minutes.

	Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
	staircase.


	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
	Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
	He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
	inside, climbing in after her and asking:

				STORMIE
		Where'd you get the truck?

				ERWIN
		Same place I've got Jason hid.

				STORMIE
		And where's that?

				ERWIN
		A place where no one ever goes.

	Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
	out of the parking lot.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
	worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
	past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
	short distance away from the pier and the three of
	them climb out.

	Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
	as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
	platform tied up to the end.

				STORMIE
		What'd you do -- take him for a
		swim?

				ERWIN
		Almost.

	Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
	a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
	down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
	pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
	Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
	asks:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Is she going to be alright?

				STORMIE
		I don't know. She's pretty fucked
		up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

				ERWIN
		You're a strong woman.

				STORMIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
		anything.

	Stormie gestures to the tarp.

				STORMIE
		Is this him?

				ERWIN
		Yeah...
			(whips back tarp)
		Meet the new and improved Jason.

	ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
	platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
	coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
	done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
	barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
	been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
	mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
	bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

				STORMIE
		Why'd you put that stupid mask
		on him?

				ERWIN
		Take a look...

	Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
	and quickly replaces it.

				STORMIE
		Good idea.

				ERWIN
		Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
		is he?

				STORMIE
		So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
		Osbourne song backwards or something?

				ERWIN
		I'm afraid it's not that simple...

				STORMIE
		I thought you said you knew how to
		bring him back to life?

				ERWIN
		I do! But when I was putting him
		back together, I noticed something
		was missing.

	Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

				STORMIE
		Awwww, he won't be needing that...
		I mean, what girl would let him
		put his rotten ol'...

				ERWIN
			(cuts her off)
		No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
		it's missing.

				STORMIE
		Well... does it really matter?
		Can't you use an aquarium pump or
		something?

				ERWIN
		No... he has to have a heart. A
		human heart. A good one.

	Meagan speaks for the first time:

				MEAGAN
		I know where we can get a heart...
		A good one.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
	a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
	Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
	parked a safe distance away.

				ERWIN
		That guard in there might pose a
		problem.

				MEAGAN
		Do you think you and Stormie could
		keep him occupied for a few minutes?

	Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
	not?

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Okay... let's do it.

	A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
	up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
	and goes to the glass door, peering out.

	ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
	making out -- hot and heavy.


	INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

	Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
	crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
	to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
	dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
	full of organs, etc.

	Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
	one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
	ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
	Even worse.

	Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
	to quiver as she caresses his face.


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
	in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
	He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
	better look.

	Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

				STORMIE
		Hey! Watch that!

				ERWIN
		I'm just trying to make it look real.

				STORMIE
		Just keep your hands above the bra,
		pizza face.

	The windows are starting to steam up.


	INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

	Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
	gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
	ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
	knife.

	Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
	sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
	far above her head.

				MEAGAN
		Forgive me, Jesse...

	Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
	sickening THWACK!


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
	obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
	deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
	the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
	They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
	another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
	parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
	his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

	Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
	shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
	guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
	the morgue.

				STORMIE
		He's head right for her! Do some-
		thing!

	Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


	INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
	chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
	fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
	then starts pulling harder.

	In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
	and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
	the HORN stops.

	Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
	to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
	tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

	The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
	drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
	unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
	two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
	and kicks the door.

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
	inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
	He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
	of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
	a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
	a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
	cabinet...

	Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
	and cries:

				GUARD
		Stop right there!

	Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
	The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
	curses and races for the...


	EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

	The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
	close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
	shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
	guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
	that the door has closed and locked behind him.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
	cemetery.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		They said they were writin' for
		some newspaper...

				MURDOCH
		Teenagers are notorious liars.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well, after I heard about the
		accident on my police scanner, I
		came up here to have a look. When
		I found it I figured you'd want to
		know right away.

				MURDOCH
		You did the right thing.

	The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
	grave.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Damn kids... I just knew they were
		comin' up here to do somethin'
		stupid.

	The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Just got a call on the radio --
		three juveniles just broke into the
		morgue -- one male, two female. The
		guard is pretty sure the male is in
		the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Sounds like the same kids I saw.

				MURDOCH
		Did the guard say what they took?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
		they carved his heart out.
			(beat)
		They got away in a pick-up -- the
		guard didn't get the license. You
		want me to put out an A.P.B.?

				MURDOCH
		No... that won't be necessary. I
		know just where they're going, and
		just what they're up to. And this
		time... I'll be ready.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
	as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
	dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
	her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
	her and says:

				STORMIE
		You've got to quit blaming your-
		self for what happened to Jesse...
		it wasn't your fault.

				MEAGAN
		He didn't want to come with us...
		but he did anyway. He did it for me.

				STORMIE
		I'm not sorry I came... I don't
		think Jesse would be, either.

				MEAGAN
		I just can't believe he's dead. I
		keep thinking he'll show up any
		minute...

				ERWIN
		Well, that just about does it...

	Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
	the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
	it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
	Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
	them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
	from the water's edge.

	In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
	cable.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		As you can see, I've excavated the
		power cable that runs across the
		bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
		away the insulation, exposing a
		patch of cable right near the water's
		edge.

	Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
	at the head of the trench.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Now when I kick this over, the water
		will wash down the trench and bridge
		an eletrical gap between the cable
		and the lake. There's plenty of
		voltage, so it should work.

				STORMIE
		So you kick the bucket and Jason
		lives.

				ERWIN
		Yeah, right...
			(then)
		Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

	Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
	the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
	A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
	glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
	girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
	engulfing the diving platform.

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
	onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

	CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
	spirals down into the eye hole like water running
	down a drain.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
	eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

					OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

	EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

	CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
	reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
	pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
	beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

	JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
	down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
	rye. He bellows:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Jason! Git your ass over here!

	Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
	slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
	several paces away.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		What did I teach you, boy? Don't
		ever take your mask off out in
		public. I don't want nobody to see
		that ugly mug of yours.

	Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
	smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
	woodshed.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Go git in the woodshed.

	Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
	knows what's coming next.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Drop them overalls and lay over
		them logs...

	Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
	Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
	calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Jason! Come here!

	Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
	towards his mother.

				JASON'S FATHER
		What are you doing woman?

	Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
	dollars and change.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I saved up some money... I want
		you to take and go on up to that
		summer camp just up the road. Tell
		the man you want to stay there.

				JASON'S FATHER
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing, bitch?!

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

				JASON'S FATHER
		You ain't sending him nowhere.
			(to Jason)
		Bring me that money, boy!

	Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
	obey, when his mother shoos him away.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Go on now... go!

	Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
		the shed, woman!

	Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		You ain't ever taking anyone to
		the shed ever again.

	Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
	back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
	Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
	coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
	arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
	view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
	way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
	him, calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		Go on, son... have a good time!
		Mommy will come and git you some
		day soon!

	Jason turns and runs to...


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
	to the camp with his jar of money.

	In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
	and shakes his hand.

				HEAD COUNSELOR
		Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
		you'll have a great time!

					CUT TO:

	The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
	laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
	breaks away, running towards the pier.

	Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
	reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
	distortions in the water make his face look normal.

	Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
	aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
	appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
	he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

	Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
	stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
	water.

	JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
	whoever is holding him under.

	Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
	the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
	him before he dies.

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
	the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
	shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

				ERWIN
		Holy shit! It worked!

	Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
	is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
	to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

				MEAGAN
		It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
		it off!

				ERWIN
		Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
		to me that I hadn't really planned
		for that contingency.

				STORMIE
		Just don't stand there! Do something!

	But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
	rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
		Do you hear me? Get up!

	Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
	against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
	rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

	A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
	and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
	electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
	smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
	Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

				ERWIN
		Well... it's off now.

	Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
	shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
	between them, offering quick excuses and humble
	apologies.

	All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
	never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
	the lake.

	Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
	after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
	gait.

	Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
	dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
	out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
	and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
	and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
	then calls to the girls:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
		up in the tool shed!

	Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
	through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
	girl and runs away.


	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
	spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

				MEAGAN
		Who are you calling?!

				STORMIE
		The cops! Who else?!

				MEAGAN
		Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
		up and throw away the key!

				STORMIE
		Fine by me!
			(clicks the receiver)
		Damnit! It's dead!

	Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
	the door shut behind him.

				ERWIN
		He's right behind me!

	Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
	Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

				STORMIE
			(to Erwin)
		You're the one who brought him
		back to life!

				ERWIN
		And?!

				STORMIE
		Well, do something!

	Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
	Stormie clucks:

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, some hero!

	Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
	Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
	closet, closing themselves inside.

	They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
	moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
	breathing.

	Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
	closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
	out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

	Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
	up in front of him and yells:

				MEAGAN
		STOP!

	To everyone's shock... Jason does.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now... just stop! We're the ones
		that brought you back to life.
		And you have no right to kill us
		with that chainsaw! In fact... you
		owe us...

				STORMIE
		That's right! She gave you her
		boyfriend's heart, you know!

				MEAGAN
		That's right.

	Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Look! Here's his picture...

	Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
	opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
	inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
	in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
	Jesse with a meaty finger.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now, I know that you've been through
		a lot. And I know that you're pissed
		off about being murdered and all.

				STORMIE
			(interjects)
		I know I would be!

				MEAGAN
		But if you help us kill Freddy
		Krueger... I promise to help you
		find the little bastard that
		killed you. What do you say? Have
		we got a deal?

	Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
	it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
	he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

	Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
	windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
	get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
	the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

	ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
	lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
	weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
	force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		You in there! This is Captain Renton
		Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
		ordering you to come out with your
		hands up! I'll give you until the
		count of three...
			(beat)
		Three!

	Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
	closet.

				MEAGAN
			(whispering)
		Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
		here and don't come out until we
		tell you. Stormie... help me!

	Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
	closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
	their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
	raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
	the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
	in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
	searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright... anybody else left in
		there had better say their prayers!

				ERWIN
		There's no one else inside.

				MURDOCH
		Is that a fact?
			(into bullhorn)
		Okay... you had your chance!

	Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
	and shouts:

				COP
		Hey, look!

	All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
	massive frame is filling the doorway.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Holy Mary, mother of God... would
		you look at the size of that guy?

				MURDOCH
			(almost happy)
		I knew it!

	All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
	suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
	behind him.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Stand back! I'll handle this.

	Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		You...

	Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
	Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
	a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

	A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
	down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
	up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing;
				 into radio)
		Let her go.


	EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
	laser-guided napalm bomb.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

	A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
	Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

	SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
	in on the laser dot on his chest.

	BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
	All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
	Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
	as he embraces the terrible sight.

				MURDOCH
		That'll teach you to fuck with the
		law, Voorhees!

	A cop behind him says:

				COP
		Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

	Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
	is burning above the brim.

	Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
	flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
	a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
	Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
	worrisome looks through the windows just before the
	cars pull away.

	As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
	something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
	form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
	onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

				CURIOUS COP
		Hey... do you see that?

	But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
	pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
	looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

				PARTNER
		See what?

				CURIOUS COP
		I thought I saw something...

	He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

	Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
	sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
	car and driving away.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

	A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
	door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
	behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
	female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
	her desk.

	Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
	watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
	begins to devour three combo-burritos.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to try and stay awake.

				STORMIE
		Getting something to eat might help.
			(calls to Deputy)
		Yo, Butch!

				DEPUTY MILLER
		It's Deputy Miller.

				STORMIE
		Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
		we have something to eat?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		I thought you psychos only ate
		human hearts?

				STORMIE
		And I thought you pigs only ate
		donuts.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Don't make me come back there.

				STORMIE
			(low; to Meagan)
		Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
		combo-burrito cud!

	Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
	the floor in defeat.

				MEAGAN
		What am I going to do? I'll never
		be able to find Lizzy now.

				STORMIE
		You should be worrying about your-
		self... I know I am.

	Stormie plops down on her cot.

				MEAGAN
		I bet you're sorry you came with
		me now...

				STORMIE
		Nah... what are best friends for?
		Afterall, you stuck by me through
		all my crazy phases, I figure I
		owe you one big crazy phase, right?

				MEAGAN
		That's for being my best friend,
		Stormie.

	Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
	cell, unlocking it.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Come on, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		Where are we going?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Your parents are here.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
	where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
	Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
		Let me look at you...

				MEAGAN
		I'm okay, mom.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mother's been worried sick,
		Meagan. So have I.

	Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
	bloody and soiled.

				MEAGAN
		Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
	that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
	passes behind her.

	The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
	a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
	raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
	stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

	Stormie is fast asleep.

	Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
	the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
	jumps to her feet and screams.

				STORMIE
		Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

	But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
	respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
	licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
	forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
	pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
	self asleep.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

	She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

				FREDDY
		You know what they say... when you
		sleep -- you die!

	Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
		you helped one of those cultists
		escape from a hospital?

				MEAGAN
		A mental hospital.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And he said you desecrated a cemetery
		and some other really terrible things.
		Tell me you had nothing to do with
		it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

				MEAGAN
		There's no mistake.
			(to Murdoch)
		What did you do with Erwin?

				MURDOCH
		Your boyfriend is headed back to the
		looney bin where he belongs. But
		don't worry, you'll be seeing him
		soon enough... at the arraignment.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
	by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
	Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

				STORMIE
		You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
		to my various phases and many hours
		of watching violent televison, I
		have become immune to violence. Seen
		it all and done it all! Nothing you
		do can gross me out -- so why don't
		you give it your best shot, bitch!

				FREDDY
		Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

	Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
	defensive stance.

				STORMIE
		I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
		is a drill sergeant in the Marine
		Corps and he taught me just how to
		defend myself against slimy bastards
		like you.

				FREDDY
		Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
		Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
		I dare you!

	Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
	take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
	right in the nose.

				FREDDY
			(continuing;
				 surprised)
		Owwwww!

	Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
	fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
	breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
	She screams.

	Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
	up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
	Freddy smiles.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Now that's what I call getting a
		buzz.


	INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

	Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
	of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
	the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
	those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
	boogers.

	Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
	rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
	distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

				BOOGERMAN
		Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
		heh... get it?

	Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
	to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
		Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
		I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

	Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
	tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
	screams again.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

	Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

				MEAGAN
		We're wasting time! We've got to
		close down all the churches --
		Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
		ground!

	Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
	frightened looks.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Don't you understand?! He has to
		come to our reality to do it! It's
		our last chance to kill him!

				MURDOCH
		Okay, I think we've heard enough of
		this crap. Take her back to the
		lockup.

	A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
	and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
	watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
	daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

				MEAGAN
		Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
		I have to save Lizzy!

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
		even realize what you've done.

				MEAGAN
		I did what I had to do to try and
		save Lizzy!

				MURDOCH
		Yeah, including murdering your boy-
		friend and cutting his heart out.

				MEAGAN
		Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
		already dead when I cut his heart
		out!

	Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing; manic)
		Goddamnit, you don't understand!
		Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

	Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
	the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

				MURDOCH
		I know how you must feel... I had
		a dog once. I loved that dog. I
		treated her like my own daughter.
		We went camping, picnics in the
		park... I even had a little stocking
		for her nailed up on the mantle for
		Christmas. Then one day, she bit
		me... so I had to blow her brains
		out.
			(sighs)
		God, I loved that dog.


	INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

	Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
	knife.

	A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
	cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

				BOOGERMAN
		Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
		again -- gotta go!

	Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
	nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
	blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
	possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
	She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
	ahead.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Well, excuse me!

	INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
	his head.

	The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
	him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
	front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
	pulled out, kicking and screaming.

	Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
	closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
	twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
	man across the cell.

	Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
	ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
	flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
	his nasty head still alive in the center.

	Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
	extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
	the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
	he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
	Stormie's cell.

	Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
	right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
	of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
	clings to life deep inside the nostril.

	Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
	up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

				FREDDY
		Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

	Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
	with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
	cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
	screaming her head off.

	Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
	screams too.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

	As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
	hear a loud SPLAT!

				MEAGAN
		Stormie?!

	The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
	cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
	cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
	runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
	splattered with blood and bits.

	Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
	come running into the cellblock, answering the
	deputy's puke-choked scream.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Oh, God... what have I done? What
		have I done?!

	We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
	lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
	gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
	chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
	suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
	The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
	with a terrible SQUEAL.

	WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
	it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
	attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
	Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

				AMBULANCE DRIVER
		I'll go check it out. You stay here.

	The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
	road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
	carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
	the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
	it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
	He starts towards the ambulance.

	The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
	emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
	slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
	grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
	pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
	into the side of the ambulance.

	In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
	watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
	a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
	silence.

	RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
	and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
	weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
	eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

	Then... nothing.

	After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
	over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
	-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
	to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

				ERWIN
		You... want me to tell you where
		Meagan is?

	Again with the thrusting.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
		for a minute there I thought you
		were going to kill me.
			(then)
		You're not, are you?

	Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... okay! I'll take you right
		to her. Could you help me out of
		this?

	Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

	Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
	behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		I'll drive.

	Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
	the passenger side door.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... you drive.

	As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
	off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Fasten your safety belt, please.

	Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
	safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
	Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
	The CHIME goes crazy.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			(continuing)
		Fasten your safety belt, please...
		Fasten your safety belt, please...

	Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
	the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
	to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

				ERWIN
		Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

	With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
	ambulance roars away into the early morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

	Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
	as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
	to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
	she switches on the cellblock TV.

	ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
	is on.

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
		-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
		And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
		Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

	A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
	studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Good morning, friends... the Good
		Book says that each morning brings
		a new light into our lives...

	The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
	before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
	answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
	-- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
	commercial comes on:

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		You can own a videotape of Reverend
		Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
		$19.95...

					  CUT TO:

	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

	In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
	as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
	hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

				GATE GUARD
		Hello. What can I do for you?

	A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

				CULTIST
		We're here to see the Reverend
		Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
		wedding.

				GATE GUARD
		Do you have an appointment?

				CULTIST
		No. I have a Beretta.

	The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


	INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

	The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
	organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
	The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

	BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
	OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
	Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
	wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

	The cultists break into the control room, killing the
	DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
	garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
	Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
	All the feed monitors go snowy.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
	the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

				MEAGAN
		Something just happened at the TV
		station.

				DEPUTY
		Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

				MEAGAN
		What for?

				DEPUTY
		Time to get you cleaned up for court.

	Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
	get undressed.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
	a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
	are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
	skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
	dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
	side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
	shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
	catcall.

	Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
	to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
	over to Meagan and says:

				HEAD BITCH
		What's the matter, honey... you
		don't like our company?

				MEAGAN
		I like you... sure. It's just that
		I usually shower alone, that's all.

				HEAD BITCH
		Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
		they're shy...

	The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
	bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
	as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Don't fight it, baby! You know you
		want me...

	Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
	off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
	spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
	produces a shiv.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		If you won't give me a piece then
		I'll just cut one for myself...

	The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
	step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
	holds up her hands.

				MEAGAN
		Wait a second... I didn't mean to
		do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
		you come on a little strong, that's
		all. Just give me a little time to
		adjust to my new surroundings...

	The head bitch stops, curious.

				HEAD BITCH
		Are you saying you want me now?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I want you.

				HEAD BITCH
		Prove it.

	Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
	flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
	-- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
	the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
	long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
	bitch smiles.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Now that's more like it!
			(to the others)
		Hey, this bitch is alright!

	The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
	arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		You're okay, honey... what's your
		name?

				MEAGAN
		Meagan.

				HEAD BITCH
		So... what're you in for, Meagan?

				MEAGAN
			(sniffles a little)
		Oh, my friend...

				HEAD BITCH
		The bitch that died last night?

				MEAGAN
			(starts to cry)
		Yeah... they said she had some
		disease that made her... explode!
		Oh, God! Please hold me!

	The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
	smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
	of concern as one asks:

				BITCH #1
		What's this bullshit about some
		killer funk make you explode?

				HEAD BITCH
			(to Meagan)
		Easy... honey. It's goin' be
		alright. But what I asked you is
		why you're in here?

				MEAGAN
		Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
		think I gave it to her...

	The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
	were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
	but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
	the bitches race for the exit.

	The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
	shouts:

				DEPUTY
		What the hell is all the screaming
		about?!

	WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
	from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
	running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
	After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
	drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

	The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
	through the station.  Several deputies chase after
	them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
	ensues.  Chaos.

	Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
	up at the madness and mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks...


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
	on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
	The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
	head with her baton and she falls to the side,
	revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
	uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

	The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
	sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
	her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
	leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
	face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

	On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
	charging into the showers to restore order.  She
	gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
	to freedom.


	EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
	up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
	pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
	and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

				JUNIOR TROOPER
		Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

					 CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
	shakes his head, saying:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		I won't do it! It's a sin!
		Blasphemy!

	One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

				CULTIST
		Wedding or funeral... your choice.

	The reverend swallows and says:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And who would be the bride?

	Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
	and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
	lulls around as she chants softly:

				LIZZY
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
	needle from one to another.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Three... four... Better lock your
		door.

	The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
	throat.  He shudders and asks:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And the groom.

				CULTIST
		He's coming...

	Lizzy is almost asleep.

				LIZZY
		Five... six... grab your crucifix...

	The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
	Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
	falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
	an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
	the curtains on FIRE.

	As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
	appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
	leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
	to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

				FREDDY
		That's for the lift sister!
			(to the cultists)
		Hiya, kids!

				CULTISTS
			(in unison)
		Hiya, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Ready to get hitched?

				CULTISTS
		Ready, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Then let's do it!

	Lizzy looks up and smiles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Freddy...

					  CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

	A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

				DEPUTY
		We found your patrol car, Captain.
		It was abandoned near a local
		religious station.

				MURDOCH
		Religious station? Is there a
		padre there?

				DEPUTY
		Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
		casts out of that location.

				MURDOCH
		So that's where they're hiding.

					  CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		...and if there be anyone among you
		who has any reason why these two
		should not be joined in holy...

	Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
			(continuing)
		...in matrimony. Let them speak
		now...
			(under his breath)
		...please God...
			(aloud)
		...or forever hold their peace.

	WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

				MEAGAN
		Stop!

	Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing;
				 to Freddy)
		Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

				FREDDY
		You're a virgin?!

				MEAGAN
		Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

	Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
	around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

				FREDDY
		Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
		than your retard sister... okay,
		you've got the job.
			(to cultists)
		Get her ready.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

	Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
	station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
	the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
	out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
	and says:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
		State Trooper. I'm giving you until
		the count of three to come out with
		your hands up...

	A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
	hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
	other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
	calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Hand me that flare pistol.

	The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Good idea. Throw a little light on
		them -- see if we can spot their
		firing positions...

	As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
	carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
	to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
	He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
	screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
	commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright, now I'm through playing
		"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
		you punks to come out right now
		with your hands up.

	The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
	-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
	and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
	EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

	The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
	dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
	beside Freddy.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

	As the battle outside between the cultists and the
	cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
	down behind a fender to reload.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Well, it doesn't look like they're
		going to surrender.

				MURDOCH
		What we're going to need then is
		somebody to charge their lines --
		make a hole for us to slip in.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Where are you going to find anyone
		that crazy?

	Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
	police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

				MURDOCH
		Here comes one now...
			(yells)
		GO GIT 'EM, SON!

	Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
	Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
	side window as the ambulance zooms past.

	Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
	the ambulance.

	The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
	SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
	through the front gate.

	Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
	the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

				ERWIN
		That was easy enough...

	Erwin looks ahead and screams.

	ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
	directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
	machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
	ducks down.

	Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
	ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
	into the side of the station with a CRASH.

	Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
	cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
	smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
	machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
	the cultist just in time.

	As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
	greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
	OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
	punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
	Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
	Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
	towards the front door.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The wedding proceeds...

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Once again... if there be anyone
		among you who does not want these
		two people to be joined... let him
		speak now or forever hold his peace.

	Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
	reverend clears his throat to continue when...

	WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
	in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

				FREDDY
		Uh, oh...

	The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
	one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
	a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
	idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
	machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
	as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
	on the other side start POUNDING.

	Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
	slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
	it falls to the floor.

	Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
	behind him.

	Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
	wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
	looks up and says:

				ERWIN
		I can't wake them up. Freddy's
		got them trapped!

	Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
	couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
	Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
	of dream dope.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Go get him, boy!

	Jason staggers forward, falling into...


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
	entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
	head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
	the LIVING DEAD.

	Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
	shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

	Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
	boxing gloves.

	TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

				TED BUNDY
			(into microphone)
		Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
		to the fight of the century! I'm
		your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

	BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
	BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
	and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
	back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
	calls into the balcony:

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

	ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
	smoking.

				OSWALD
			(angry; defensive)
		It wasn't me!

	Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

				TED BUNDY
		In my left corner, weighing in at
		only ninety seven pounds... the
		nightmare master himself! The one!
		The only... Freddddddddy
		Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

	Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And on my right... weighing in at
		a whopping four hundred and thir-
		teen pounds... that killer of
		countless teenagers... the big
		guy...
			(gestures to Jason)
		Jason Voorhees!

	CHEERS and BOOS.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And the prize tonight... not one but
		TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
		ripe for the picking.

	Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
	Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Hey, have one now and save the other
		for the ride home. That's what I did.

	LAUGHTER from the crowd.

				MEAGAN
		Kick his ass, Jason!

	DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

	Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
	blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
	glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
	RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

	Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
	axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
	over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
	her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

				BLOODY MARY
		HEY!

	Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
	OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
	down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
	and shrugs:

				FREDDY
		Oh, well... I just axed for that!

	Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
	Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
	axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
	between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
	turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

				HITLER
		Peasants...

	DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
	into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
	his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
	starts in:

				HUMAN HEAD
		That's it, kiddo! You're really
		giving it to him out there! Use the
		left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
		That's the ticket to a knockout!

	Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
	the studio door.


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

	DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
	Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
	each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
	Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
	a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
	OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
	CHEERS.

	Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
	opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
	decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
	of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

	Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
	disgust.

	Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
	high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
	to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

	Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
	Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
	can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
	opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
	and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
	his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
	chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
	heavy metal boxing glove.

	Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
	massive glove for a blow.

	CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
	glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
	He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

	As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
	around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
	into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
	see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
	Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

	>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! Get up! Get up!

	ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
	water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
	up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
	wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

	Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
	Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
	the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jason! You've got to get up!

	JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
	him down... drowning him...

						  FLASH CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
	to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

	Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
	his killer comes into sharp focus.

	It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
	reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
	Jason down again, laughing.

						  HARD CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

	Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
	mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
	of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
	mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
	him up with him.

	Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
	ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


	INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
	he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
	the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
	pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
	real world.

				FREDDY
		Oh, shit!

	Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
	boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
	tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

	Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
	They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
	suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
	-- dead.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

	The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
	police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
	heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
	sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

				MURDOCH
		Now's my chance... give me sixty
		seconds to get in there then move
		in.

	Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
	running into the station.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
	and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

				MEAGAN
		What took you so long?!

	Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
	so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

				ERWIN
		What ever you do... don't let this
		guy drive.

	Meagan smiles at Jason.

				MEAGAN
		I knew you would come...

	Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
	fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
	scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

	The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
	then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
	disappear.

	In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
	monitor, laughing.

				ERWIN
		Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

	Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
	from the control room via a long thick cable running
	overhead.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		He's going for the satellite dish!
		If he uplinks with a communications
		satellite he can beam himself any-
		where in the world! We'll never be
		rid of him!

	Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
	past them, going through the ceiling to the...


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
	to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
	ready to beam Freddy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
	hard.


	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
	BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


	EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

	The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
	off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
	tumbling into deep space.

	The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

	Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
	and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
	skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
	One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

	ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
	solar prominence.


	INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
	a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
	dust billows up.

	Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
	Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
	this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

				ERWIN
		No! Wait!

	Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
	the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
	run to his side.

	Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
	chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
	out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin? Erwin?!

				MURDOCH
		He's dead... and so are you if you
		don't put your hands up right now!

	Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
	the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
	as he says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		It's time I taught you girls some
		respect for the law!

	In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
	cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

	PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
	SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
	large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
	turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		So... you wanna be a punk?

	Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Then die like a punk!

	Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
	hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
	jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
	pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
	with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
	see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

	As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
	hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
	of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
	muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
	the shotgun and...

	BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
	his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
	of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
	metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
	spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

	Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
	floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
	come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
	guns in panic.

				MEAGAN
		NO!

	Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
	FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
	grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
	past.

	More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
	start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
	is crowded with muzzle flash.

	More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
	hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

	The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
	up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

	VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
	opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
	passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
	cops in the studio.

	Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
	off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
	to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
	of his chest and head.

	Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
	SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
	the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
	gunsmoke in the room.

	As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
	then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

	Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
	reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
	pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

	Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
	rolls back -- he's dead.

	Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
	revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
	Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
	turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

				LIZZY
		You forgot to check under the bed.

	Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
	-- nada.

				MEAGAN
		No monsters here.

				LIZZY
		But what if they come back?

				MEAGAN
		Then we'll just have to kick their
		ass again.

	Lizzy giggles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		I love you too. Go to sleep.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
	to her from the bottom of the staircase.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Meagan?

	Meagan looks down at her parents.

				MEAGAN
		Yes, dad?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mom and I... well, we want to
		thank you for saving your sister's
		life... we know you went through
		a lot.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're going to be there for you
		from now on... for both of you!
		And that nice lawyer we hired for
		you said he thinks he can get all
		the charges dropped... except maybe
		for the grave robbing and human
		desecration ones.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Everything is going to be fine.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And I'm going to get sober...

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		We're going to be a normal, happy
		family again.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

				MEAGAN
		Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Goodnight, Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
	when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

				MEAGAN
		Hello?

				FREDDY
			(filtered)
		I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

	Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
	licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
	phone down.

				MEAGAN
			(sighs)
		I know...

	Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
	climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
	the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
	and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

					 BLACKNESS:

	The phone RINGS.

	ROLL END CREDITS:

	Then... at the very end...

					 CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

	Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
	the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
	when they went back to reality... waiting.

	Finally, somebody says:

				MONSTER
		I don't think they're coming back.

				TED BUNDY
		Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
		body can go home now.

	All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

					 CUT TO:

	BLACK... now it's over.

				THE END

EXT. A BAR IN BED-STUY - DAY

A large man in a Santa Claus suit and white beard is
entertaining a group of black children.  He leads them in
the singing of a Christmas Carol (Hark the Herald Angels
Sing).  The man is DETECTIVE FIRST GRADE JIMMY DOYLE.  His
attention is split between the children and the activity
inside the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DOYLE'S POV - DAY

The place is crowded with mid-day drinkers.  Dimly outlined
at the far end of the bar are TWO BLACK MEN involved in some
kind of transaction in which a package is exchanged for
money.  As the transaction seems to be completed, cut to

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

Santa Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,
above the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND
GRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes
of a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog
wagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his
apron, leaves the wagon, and runs toward the bar.

                         DOYLE
                   (as RUSSO passes him)
            The guy in the brown coat.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

RUSSO enter the bar on the run.  He stops and looks over the
room.

RUSSO'S POV

There are TWENTY or THIRTY MEN at the bar, at least TEN are
wearing brown coats!  The TWO MEN involved in the deal see
RUSSO and start to run.  One (THE BUYER) takes off out of
the back door.  The other (THE PUSHER) jumps over the bar
and heads for the front entrance.

                                                            3.


EXT. THE BAR - DAY

THE PUSHER dashes out past Santa Claus (DOYLE).  RUSSO
follows him and all three give chase.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

THREE FIGURES running down a New York tenement alley, the
first in flight, the others in pursuit.  We pick up the
incredible clutter of such an alley, mounts of rusting beer
cans, paper bags of garbage bulging and ripping open, old
bed springs, burned out mattresses, etc.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of BLACK PUSHER tripping on the tangle of trash
going up against the wall in his stumble, face toward the
camera, and the figures of RUSSO and DOYLE leaping upon him
from off-camera.  There is a blur or fast struggle as DOYLE
and RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.
BLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his
hand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.

                         RUSSO
            Son of a bitch!

The words are both warning and a grunt of pain.  As RUSSO
takes the blade and utters the words, we simultaneously go
to DOYLE crouching and snatching his .38 out of the right
ankle holster.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and the BLACK PUSHER, DOYLE pistol-
whipping him into submission with three lightening chops of
the gun to the PUSHER'S head.  DOYLE continues to beat the
man mercilessly into submission.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

3-shot of BLACK PUSHER sitting between DOYLE and RUSSO.
DOYLE is at the wheel.  BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his
hands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping
blood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.  All
three are breathing hard.

                         DOYLE
            What's your name, asshole?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Fuck you, Santa Claus!

DOYLE hits him across the face.

                                                            4.


                         RUSSO
            Your name is Willie Craven.

BLACK PUSHER doesn't look up.

                         DOYLE
            Who's your connection, Willie?
            What's his name?

No response.

                         RUSSO
            Who killed the old Jew in the
            laundromat?

BLACK PUSHER's brow furrows, looks up just a little.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't...

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            What?

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever pick your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't know what you're talkin'
            about.

                         DOYLE
            Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            No... yeah...

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever sit on the edge of the
            bed, take off your socks and stick
            your fingers between your toes?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Man, I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You made three sales to your
            roaches back there.  We had to
            chase you through all this shit and
            you tell me you're clean?

                                                            5.


                         RUSSO
            Who stuck up the laundromat?

                         DOYLE
            How about that time you were
            picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for
relief from the pressure of the inquisition.

                         RUSSO
                   (in pain)
            You better give me the guy who got
            the old Jew or you better give me
            something or you're just a memory
            in this town.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            That's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do
            nothin'.

The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion
and fear.

                         DOYLE
            You put a shiv in my partner.  Know
            what that means?  All winter I
            gotta listen to him gripe about his
            bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust
            your ass for those three bags -
            then I'm gonna nail you for pickin'
            your feet in Poughkeepsie.

EXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP
AND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT

DOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of
the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The
sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained
bandage on the left forearm.

                         DOYLE
            Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb
            guinea.

                         RUSSO
            How'd I know he had a knife.

                         DOYLE
            Never trust a nigger.

                         RUSSO
            He coulda been white.

                                                            6.


                         DOYLE
            Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?

                         RUSSO
            Not a chance.

RUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical
rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a
business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is
part of the inventory.

                         DOYLE
            Let's popeye around the Chez for a
            half hour, catch the end of the
            show and a couple drinks.

                         RUSSO
            Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.

DOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat
for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause,
sticks one in RUSSO's mouth.

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you
            say?

                         RUSSO
            Drink this.

                         DOYLE
            Whip it out.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

THE TITLES COMMENCE

                    THE FRENCH CONNECTION

Titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits
and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We
zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to
occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes
immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives
their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks
RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE
turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair
opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is
concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and
the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort
of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,
why they are there.

                                                            7.


INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick
certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems
too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and
CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's
attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that
emanate from the same large table.

                         DOYLE
            I make at least two junk connections
            at that table in the corner.  The
            guy is the stripe combo, I know him
            too.

                         RUSSO
            Hey, I thought we come for a drink.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close
foreground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.

                         DOYLE
            Who is that guy?

                         RUSSO
            Policy man in Queens.

                         DOYLE
            What about the last of the big-time
            spenders.  You make him?

RUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from
DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL
BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,
the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars
of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture
of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their
hair coiffed towers.

                         RUSSO
            No, you?

                         DOYLE
            Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He
            spreads it like the Russians are in
            Jersey.

                         RUSSO
            He probably sells insurance.  Owns
            a chicken farm in Hackensack.

                                                            8.


Zoom in slowly on SAL as he deals tips and orders.  Through
DOYLE's eyes, we go from Guest to Guest at SAL's table,
taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and
laugh, lost in the show chatter.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE finishing his drink, still looking at the table.

                         DOYLE
            Dig who's just come over.  The
            creep on the end.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

The camera pans down the table to dig the "creep on the end."

                         RUSSO (VO)
            Jewish Lucky from the Bronx... He
            don't look the same without a
            number across his chest.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE close in right profile, SAL's table in the far blurred
background.

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you say we wait and give him
            a tail?

                         RUSSO
            Give who a tail?

                         DOYLE
            The greaser with the blonde.

                         RUSSO
            What for -- you wanna play Hide the
            Salami with his old lady?

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- just for fun --

INT/EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

The view from the back seat of DOYLE's car.  DOYLE is at the
wheel, RUSSO packed uncomfortably into the corner at DOYLE's
right.  Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the
street the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is
parked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender
talking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for
a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips,
crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.

                                                            9.


One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going
through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing
the name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance
of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette
business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting
through the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his
pocket.

                         DOYLE
            Monica?  Who's Monica?

                         RUSSO
                   (handing him a cigarette)
            A and A, that's all you're
            interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

As soon as DOYLE has finished lighting the cigarette SAL and
his PARTY come bubbling out of the Club noisily, a little
drunkenly.  SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.

DOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand
on the ignition key.  He does not turn it.  He is waiting
for the cover of noise from the starting of SAL's car.
RUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend,
his head back, arms across his chest.

                         DOYLE
            Cloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us
            to Little Italy.

DOYLE reaches under his seat for the straw surveillance
hat - throws it up to read ledge of car.

                         RUSSO
            I'm telling you, Popeye, he owns a
            bagel mine in the Bronx.

A long view of the Club entrance.  SAL and ANGIE, a well-
built "classy" blonde with good legs, get into their black
Mercury sedan.  The Mercury takes off towards First Avenue.
We hear DOYLE's car start and we move off after them on the
last blink of tail-lights at the corner.

EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

Cabs, Daily News and Times delivery trucks, bakery vans and
a few cruising cabs, one or two passenger cars and a coasting
green and black police cruiser -- this is the 4:30 a.m.
traffic through which DOYLE moves.

A rear-window view of SAL and ANGIE BOCA, in animated
conversation.  His head is turned toward her, his hand
raised in a gesture.  ANGIE is sitting in a corner with her
back to the door, in profile to the back window.

                                                           10.


Her blonde head bobbles with laughter over some remark SAL
has made.

A long overhead view of the two cars wheeling in and out of
the sparse traffic.

Close shot of the license plate on BOCA's car.

Close shot DOYLE staring at license plate, memorizing it.

EXT. RATNER'S - DAY

BOCA and ANGIE exit restaurant, get into their car and drive
off.  Hold for DOYLE's car as it passes through after them.

EXT. MULBERRY STREET - DAY

Side close view of SAL turning south into Mott Street
panning to pick up the Italian names on the candy stores,
funeral parlors, bars, grocery stores, social clubs.

A long view of SAL's car from the DOYLE-RUSSO auto, over the
shoulders of the two cops.  DOYLE is leaning on the wheel of
his car.  He's against the curb about 100 yards behind SAL.

Medium close view of SAL in the middle of Mott Street,
walking quickly toward the opposite side of the street,
hands in the pocket of his white raincoat.  He glances over
his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car.

Close of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor
has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This
district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York.

Close rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level
of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at
that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights,
can be seen in the background walking around the cars,
across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway.

Medium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the
doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes
something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into
the doorway.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close from the front of DOYLE and RUSSO low against the
dashboard.

                         DOYLE
            It's a drop!

DOYLE's face, close, light smile.

                                                           11.


Long view of SAL walking down the sidewalk quickly for about
a quarter of a block while the headlights of his car, with
ANGIE apparently driving, move up with him.  At another
doorway, he looks back and then steps inside.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Long view of SAL's Mercury moving over Brooklyn Bridge.

Close shot of the DOYLE-RUSSO car from RUSSO's side.  BUDDY
now interested, watching.

EXT. BROOKLYN - DAY

Overhead view of cars circling block, first Mercury turning
corner, then DOYLE's Ford.

Long shot of the Mercury pulling up beside line of parked
cars (as seen from DOYLE-RUSSO car) stopping and parking.
Hold on Mercury as SAL and ANGIE get out of it.  SAL locking
it up, and starting to walk toward a line of parked cars.

Close shot from rear seat of DOYLE and RUSSO glancing at
each other.

SAL and ANGIE stop in the street beside beat-up white Dodge.
Without a word they get in.  Hold as they get in, SAL starts
and they begin to drive out of the spot.

Close on DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            It's startin' to cook, Cloudy, my
            man is cookin'...

A series of impressionist traveling shots of the white Dodge
and DOYLE's Ford moving through Brooklyn Streets, picking up
street signs of areas.

In near background, a candy-confectionery store.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO in profile driving past the
candy store as SAL and ANGIE open door and go in.

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO parked.  DOYLE is looking in
the rear-view mirror while BUDDY is turned around on the
seat, looking out the rear window.

A long shot, from the DOYLE-RUSSO viewpoint of the candy
store.  The door is open, the street is deserted.  Lights
are going on in the little shop.

                                                           12.


Hold on the storefront as SAL appears, this time in a candy
store operator's smock over a white undershirt, baggy slacks.
He's carrying a stack of newspapers.  Zoom in on SAL stacking
the Sunday Times and the Daily News on the rack in front of
the store as ANGIE appears in the doorway.  She's blackhaired
now, the blonde wig gone, also wearing a grey cotton smock
over a plain skirt and sweater, holding a cup of coffee.  We
hold on them for a beat, then

                                            CUT TO:

DOYLE and RUSSO close just looking at each other.  The look
says everything about the freak case they have stumbled into.

EXT. QUAY MARSEILLE SHIPYARD

1) Tight two shot then, 2) cut into blue prints.

                         CHARNIER

            par équipe.

                         MARCEL
            Le Syndicat exigera un minimum de 12.

                         CHARNIER
            Quelle importance.  Ce qui compte
            pour moi c'est d'avoir un chantier
            qui puisse recevoir les plus grands
            bateaux du monde.

                         MARCEL
            Dis moi vieille branche?  Comment
            fais tu pour rester si jeune avec
            la vie que tu mènes?

                         CHARNIER
            Quelle vie Marcel?  J'ai plus rien
            foutu depuis que je suis descendu
            de ces cabines.

                                                           13.

the most part VOICE OVER.

Various shots of SAL and ANGIE.  Several shots of DOYLE and
RUSSO in the CANDY STORE: reading magazines, having lunch

                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            Our friend's name is SALVATORE BOCA.
            They call him SAL.  He's a
            sweetheart.  He once was picked up
            on suspicion of armed robbery.
            Tried to hold up Tiffany's on Fifth
            Avenue!  In broad daylight!  Could
            have got two-and-a-half to five,
            but they wouldn't prosecute.  Also
            downtown they're sure he pulled off
            a contract on a guy named DeMarco.

ANGIE makes a tuna sandwich on a roll.  A cigarette dangles
from her lips.  SAL is in BG at cash register with customer.

                                                           18.


                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            Her name's Angie... Fast filly...
            she drew a suspended for shoplifting
            a year ago... only a kid, nineteen
            according to the marriage license.

From front of store looking to back.

                         DOYLE (V.O.)
            Yeah, nineteen goin' on fifty.
            What else?

RUSSO is at counter eating lunch with three others... ANGIE
serving.  She wears a sleeveless sweater; shows lots of tit.
RUSSO digs... she digs him.  A wise guy comes in, goes to
the back room.  SAL follows.

                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            He's had the store a year an'a
            half... takes in a fast seven grand
            a year.

            and hundred dollar tabs at the Chez?

down with magazine.  Orders coffee.

                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            The Merc's in his wife's name.
            Dodge belongs to his brother.

WARD'S ISLAND - DAY

A heavy-faced, dirty looking man in a Sanitation Dept.

                         RUSSO (V.O.)

SEVERAL SHOTS - DAY

EXT. CANDY STORE

LOU pulls up.  As LOU picks up SAL.  They drive to various

then goes on.  DOYLE and RUSSO watch from DOYLE's car.

SUYDAM STREET

                         DOYLE
            If that's not a drop or a pickup,
            I'll open a charge for you at
            Bloomingdale's.

                         RUSSO

            parole time in there night or day.

SAL arrives alone.  DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car across
street.

                         DOYLE
            They treat our boy like a king.
            Wonder why he don't bring his old
            lady?

SAL flirts with the BARMAID.

                         RUSSO
            There's your answer...

THROUGH RIDGEWOOD - DAY

Restaurants, stores, etc.

                         DOYLE
            Who's the greaser?

With SAL and his FATHER.

                         RUSSO
            It's his father.

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                                                           20.


                         DOYLE
            I think we oughta burn him on
            suspicion.

                         RUSSO
            Suspicion of what?

                         DOYLE
            Makin' wine in the basement.
                   (pause)
            He looks like that wop stooge used
            to drive for the Fracisi brothers.

LOU joins them.  He and SAL leave together after each kisses
and embraces the old man.

                         RUSSO
            Lay off with that wop stuff, will
            you?

EXT. WEINSTOCK'S APT. BUILDING - DAY

In the East 80's.  SAL exits.

                         DOYLE
            That's the third time he come here
            this week.  You got anything on the
            building?

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            The building's clean.  I checked
            the tenant list -- Don Ameche, the
            actor lives there -- oh, and
            somebody else.  Do the name Joel
            Weinstock ring a bell?

TIME LAPSE

Late day.  WEINSTOCK leaving building, nodding to doorman.

                         DOYLE
            You're kiddin'

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            No sir -- this is where Joel lives.

                         DOYLE
            He was the bank on that shipment
            outta Mexico three years ago.

                                                           21.


                         RUSSO
            So I've heard.

EXT. CANDY STORE - NIGHT

SAL and ANGIE leaving.

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you know -- he's takin' his
            wife out for a change.

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

INT. LEATHER FACTORY - DAY

Across street from Candy Store.  DOYLE and RUSSO at the
printing machine.

                         DOYLE
                   (at leather printing machine)
            Got a job for me when this is over,
            Mrs. Levene?

They have a view of the Candy Store across street.  Various
people go in and out.  Next to DOYLE, at a stamping machine,
is MRS. LEVENE, the factory owner.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What are you fellows looking for?
            What do you want from that nice
            candy store?

                         DOYLE
            We have reason to believe it's a
            front for the biggest counterfeiting
            operation in the country.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What?

                         DOYLE
            That's right.  They're trying to
            steal the formula for Hershey
            bars --

DOYLE continues his work at the print-out machine, while
observing the candy store.

We see SAL leaving the store.  He crosses to his car, near
the RUSSO car.  As he passes it, he sees RUSSO locked in
embrace with a lady in a babushka.  As SAL drives off, we
get a closer look at the "LADY" in the babushka: DETECTIVE
JAMES DOYLE.

                                                           22.


INT. RUSSO'S CAR ON TRIBORO BRIDGE CROSSING TO WARD'S ISLAND

                         DOYLE
            What the hell am I drivin' for?
            I'm a first grade Detective.
            You're a second grade guinea.

                         RUSSO
            I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.

SAL up ahead in the Mercury.

                         DOYLE
                   (at the wheel)
            What?

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND - BRIDGE

The Mercury crossing the bridge to the Island.

                         RUSSO
            He's goin' to Ward's Island.  We'll
            get spotted.  What the hell's he
            goin' there?

DOYLE-RUSSO car B.G.

                         DOYLE
            Maybe he's goin' to see his brother.

                         DOYLE
            Or could be another drop.  I guess
            he gets a free ride.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

A Brooklyn slum street on a morning in November.  It is
about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet.  A scattering of
tenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life.  There
are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all
appearing to be closed.  We look down the street and pick up
DOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.  They
are heading toward the bar.  A young man is coming out -
they grab him and throw him back.

INT. BAR ROOM - DAY

The Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO.
There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the
joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of
dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy
with conversation, laughter and music.

                                                           23.


DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to
the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at
his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt,
under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting
to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the
bar.

DOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of
the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.

                         DOYLE
            Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here!

Twenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle-
taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move
until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of
the customers doesn't.

                         DOYLE
            What's my name?

                         1ST MAN
            Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         1ST MAN
            Mr. Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         1ST MAN
            What?

DOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The
MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to
DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of
them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,
running the length of it.

Close of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming
the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the
magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking
at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the
customers.

Close shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking
into it.

Close shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one
of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on
the bar.

                                                           24.


Then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of
heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He
empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail
mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled
with tomato juice.

DOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours
the mixture into the ashcan.

                         DOYLE
            Milk shake anyone?

He wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to
step forward.  The MEN do not move at first.

                         DOYLE
            Move ass when I tell you.

They move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO
BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN.

                         DOYLE
            Put it on the bar.

Hands of the THREE MEN going into pockets.

Close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto
the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana
cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates.

                         DOYLE
                   (collecting the works)
            All right, you three clowns step
            into those phone booths, you're
            goin' in.  Go on.  Stand in there
            till I'm ready for you.

The three men turn and enter the individual phone booths.
They stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 Question.

                         DOYLE
            Everybody goes when the whistle
            blows.

RUSSO is with another man from whom he's just taken a set of
works.

                         RUSSO
            What's your story?

                         DANCER
            Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in
            show business.

                                                           25.


                         RUSSO
            You're in show business.

                         DANCER
            S'right.

                         DOYLE
            What do you do in show business?

                         DANCER
            I'm a dancer.

                         RUSSO
            All right, get up on that bar and
            dance.

                         DANCER
            What?

                         RUSSO
            Get up on the bar and show me how
            you work.  If I like it you don't
            have to go in.

                         DANCER
            You're for real?

                         JERRY LEON
            Hey man, why don't you let the
            fella alone.

                         RUSSO
                   (a shout)
            Am I talkin' to you -

                         JERRY LEON
            No, but I'm talkin' to you.

                         RUSSO
            I'm tellin' you to shut up and
            stand over there.

                         RUSSO
                   (to Dancer)
            Get up there.

The man climbs up on the bar.

                         DANCER
            I got no music!

                         RUSSO
            Fake it.

                                                           26.


The man goes into a fast tap dance.  But he only gets in a
few steps --

                         DOYLE
            All right, that's enough, you're
            under arrest.

RUSSO pulls the man off the bar, sends him into one of the
phone booths.

DOYLE coming down the front of the bar.  He stops before
another man, who has just come out of the toilet.

                         DOYLE
            What about you?  Can you stand a
            toss?

                         2ND MAN
            I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You don't use shit?

                         2ND MAN
            No.
                   (he goes for his wallet)


                         DOYLE
            Did I say you could move that
            hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?

                         2ND MAN
            No - no.

                         DOYLE
            Cause if I do.

DOYLE frisks the man.  Comes up with vial of pills and two
roaches.

                         DOYLE
            Wise guy, huh?  Let's see what else
            you got.
                   (to RUSSO)
            - Buddy!

He collars the man and shoves him towards the toilet.

RUSSO, eyes moving everywhere, hand on the gun.

                                                           27.


                         RUSSO
            If I see any shit on the floor,
            it's yours, so keep your eye on
            your neighbor.

Inside the toilet of the bar.  The MAN is up against the
wall.  DOYLE is only inches away.

The MAN is an AGENT and this is the only way DOYLE can get
immediate information from him without destroying the man's
cover.  Their conversation is in whispers.  And very fast.

                         DOYLE
            How's everything?

                         2ND MAN
            Everything is everything.

                         DOYLE
            How come there's nothing out there?
            That stuff is all milk.

                         2ND MAN
            There's nothing around.  Nobody's
            holding.

                         DOYLE
            I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.

                         2ND MAN
            Boca?

                         DOYLE
            B.O.C.A.

                         2ND MAN
            Doesn't register.

                         DOYLE
            Got a wife named Angie.

                         2ND MAN
            No, nothing.  There's only some talk.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         2ND MAN
            Coming in this week, week after.
            Everybody going to get well.

                         DOYLE
            Who brings it?

                                                           28.


                         2ND MAN
            Who knows?

                         DOYLE
            Where do you want it?

                         2ND MAN
            This side.

Door of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming
behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled
prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man
to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway
down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another
one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides
that would be futile too.

                         DOYLE
            I'm goin' check on this address in
            the Bronx, if you're bullshitting
            me, it's your ass.

                         RUSSO
            Tell everybody we'll be back in an
            hour.

                         DOYLE
                   (to all)
            We're goin' now!  Goodbye.

EXT. PASSENGER SHIP - DAY

Close shot of DEVEREAUX, New York harbor in the background,
being interviewed by television reporters on his arrival in
the U.S. abroad a passenger ship.  He is smiling, jovial,
charming.

                         REPORTER 1
            How long will you be here?

                         DEVEREAUX
            Not long enough.  Two... perhaps
            three... weeks at most.

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX and THREE TV REPORTERS, as
they talk, a crane moves into action behind them and lifts
out of hold.  LA VALLE is with DEVEREAUX as Translator and
Interpreter.

                         GIRL TV REPORTER
            Why did you come by ship, Mr.
            Devereaux?

                                                           29.


                         DEVEREAUX
            The next several weeks will be very
            difficult and the middle of the
            ocean is the only place where the
            telephone isn't ringing all the time.

                         REPORTER
            What will be the viewpoint of your
            documentary.

                         DEVEREAUX
            To make a Frenchman feel what it is
            like to be a New Yorker.

                         LA VALLE
            That's enough now, ladies and
            gentlemen.  M. Devereaux is due at
            his hotel in half an hour.

Overhead the Lincoln comes down from the hold of the ship.

EXT. WEST SIDE DRIVE - DAY

A long view of the pier from the opposite (east) side of
West Street, beneath the steel trusses and girders of the
West Side Drive and through the forest of cars that are
parked there, the jam of traffic that develops around every
unloading vessel.  It is a view that takes in the front end
of the Lincoln inching off the pier.  HENRI DEVEREAUX at the
wheel, turns to his right.  We watch until the point of view
on the sidewalk.  ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI are
standing there watching.  When the car (off-camera) turns
east on the way to the garage, NICOLI glances to CHARNIER.
CHARNIER does not look back.

EXT. DORAL HOTEL - LINCOLN PULLS IN - DAY

INT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT

Close shot of WALTER SIMONSON at desk in the large square
office he occupies as a Lieutenant of Detectives in charge
of the Manhattan Narcotics Bureau.  He is the immediate
superior of RUSSO and DOYLE, head of the 200-man narcotics
squad that polices Manhattan.

                         SIMONSON
                   (with coffee cup)
            All that is great -- but you guys
            work Bed-Stuy.  You're not supposed
            to be in Ridgewood.

DOYLE, RUSSO and SIMONSON

                                                           30.


                         DOYLE
            Detach us.  Let us have a shot at
            it, at least until we see if
            there's anything here or not.
            Everybody wants Weinstock, right?
            So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve
            it.

                         SIMONSON
            You couldn't burn a three-time
            loser with what you're bringing in
            here.  You know you stiffs could
            run yourselves an entrapment rap.
            The guy has done nothing -- Brooklyn
            is full of Candy Store guys with
            two cars who like to go to
            nightclubs.

                         RUSSO
            Put this little candy hustler
            together with Joel Weinstock and it
            could be we stumbled into a big
            score.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves to window)
            Big score!  He's dealin' a few bags
            here and there on the side.

                         DOYLE
            Simonson, I wouldn't be infringing
            on your coffee break if I thought
            he was a nickel and dimer.

                         SIMONSON
            Your hunches have backfired before,
            Doyle.

DOYLE, close, no comment.

Back to SIMONSON.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves back to stand
                   at desk)
            Jimmy, what the hell's happening
            with you lately?
                   (pause)
            You got more collars than any Narc
            in the bureau.  What was it.  Over
            100 last year?  Terrific.  But who?
                         (MORE)

                                                           31.


                         SIMONSON (CONT'D)
            You stop and shake down a bellboy
            because he's got three joints in
            his sock.  You hit a high school
            kid in short pants who looks like
            he's got a twitch.

RUSSO.  Getting it back on the track.

                         RUSSO
                   (moves in to desk)
            We got information that there's no
            shit in the street -- it's like a
            desert full of junkies with a big
            score coming in to make everybody
            well.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            This could be it, Walter.  This
            Candy Store guy, putting on a big
            show in a fancy nightclub with
            known connections all over him.
            Then on our own, after working the
            whole day and night, we tail him
            out to Brooklyn and sit on him for
            a week practically, and who do we
            come up with?  Joel Weinstock.
                   (he leans forward)
            You gotta let us have it.

THREE SHOT - RUSSO, DOYLE, SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
                   (pause, he turns to RUSSO)
            You really believe all this crap?

                         RUSSO
            I go with my partner.

A pause.

                         SIMONSON
            What'll it take?

                         RUSSO
            First a wire.

                         DOYLE
            Two wires.  One on the store and
            one on his house.

                                                           32.


                         SIMONSON
            You know I have to get a court
            order for wiretaps.

                         RUSSO
            Try... okay?

                         DOYLE
            We know you can do it, Walter.

They start to leave.

Close on SIMONSON.

                         SIMONSON
            Popeye...

Close on DOYLE at the door.  RUSSO beside him.

Back to SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
            You still pickin' your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?

  What's this crap.  I just          (He raps on table

  Well, if you can't do better
  than that, you can stick the
  cups.

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD (HUNTS POINT AND EAST RIVER) - DAY

HIGH ANGLE: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE
walking slowly together toward the camera.  They are at the
auto graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off
New York streets by the Police Department.  About twenty
other men are walking around, looking at the cars.

A POLICEMAN blows a whistle and the prospective car buyers
gather around the auction trailer in the b.g.

                         LA VALLE
            There are four auto graveyards like
            this one in the other boroughs,
            handling about a thousand vehicles
            a month.  Those that aren't claimed
            are auctioned here once a month.

                         MARIE
            Just for mistakes of parking?

                                                           34.


                         LA VALLE
            No.  Many are involved in crimes
            and confiscated... or just abandoned.
            This is, as you know, your prime
            source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

                         MARIE
                   (off camera)
            Darling, may I have this one?

Medium close shot MARIE, standing next to an LTD.

                         MARIE
            It looks so lonesome here.

CHARNIER and LA VALLE approach her.

                         CHARNIER
            It would look even more lonesome in
            our garage.

INT. THE AUCTION TRAILER - DAY

Within the large trailer, about TWENTY MEN are seated at two
long benches to each side.  Some are standing to the rear.
At the front, an AUCTIONEER stands at a lectern.  To his
left sits a CLERK at a small table.  The AUCTIONEER wears a
sweater and hat.  The buyers are tough types, young and old.
All have inventory lists.  The atmosphere is informal.  The
CHARNIERS and LA VALLE enter the trailer at the back.

                         AUCTIONEER
            Every car sold today must be
            removed at the purchaser's own
            expense.  We have no keys or
            anything to start the vehicles with.
            You buy 'em as you see 'em and
            where you see 'em.  All right, the
            first car offered is Number 24398.
            A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear
            fifteen dollars?

The bidding goes up to forty dollars.  A large BURLY MAN
wins the bid.  He goes up to the CLERK and accepts the bill
of sale.

                         AUCTIONEER
            We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station
            wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars?

                         LA VALLE
                   (aside to CHARNIER)
            Notice he will never mention the
            year of the car.

                                                           35.


                         AUCTIONEER
            I got a fifteen dollar bid going...
            Do I hear anymore...
            Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen?
            Twenty...
            Twenty-three...
            Anymore...
            Twenty-five.  Twenty-five once --
            Do I hear twenty-eight...
            All right, last call for twenty-
            five...

                         CHARNIER
                   (aside of LA VALLE)
            And these are the cars we're buying
            for shipment?

Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE.  They are facing
the AUCTIONEER.

                         LA VALLE
            Yes, sir.  That man in the dark
            jacket is our buyer.

            Takin' care o' business -- it's

                         SAL (V.O.)

            tonight --

                                                           36.

            -- Well finish all your meetin'
            people and get back here now -- and
            bring a pizza with you.

            I don't know where I'm gonna find a

            Sal --

                         SAL (V.O.)
            Yeah?

                         ANGIE (V.O.)
            Don't forget anchovies.
                   (she hangs up)


                         SAL (V.O.)
            This broad's crazy!

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND (UNDER WEST ABUTMENT OF THE HELLGATE
BRIDGE)

Pick up CHARNIER, MARIE and MAURICE LAVALLE

As the camera plays over the bridge: (in French)

                         CHARNIER (V.O.)
            It's beautiful.

                         LA VALLE (V.O.)
            It was built in 1917 - and was one
            of the two heaviest bridges in the
            world.  The arch is still the
            largest in the world.

                         CHARNIER
            Who financed it?

                                                           37.


                         LA VALLE
            Two railroads as part of a
            connecting railway which provided
            passage from New England to the
            South.  It was actually the first
            railroad through New York City.

                         MARIE
            Why is it called Hellgate?

                         LA VALLE
            The river at this point is the most
            dangerous on the East Coast.  Years
            ago, hundreds of ships went down
            here.

                         CHARNIER
            If this bridge were in Europe, it
            would be on every tourist's sight-
            seeing list.

                         LA VALLE
            Most New Yorkers never notice it -
            most Americans have never heard of
            it.

                         CHARNIER
            Look how gracefully they conceived
            that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It
            was built from both ends.  With no
            support in the middle.  Beautiful.

                         LA VALLE
            Mmm.

                         MARIE
            Alain is the only man I know who
            can become as enthusiastic about a
            bridge as he can about a woman.

                         CHARNIER
            Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

                         LA VALLE
            I'm afraid the rest of Ward's
            Island isn't nearly as romantic - a
            pollution plant, a hospital, a
            training school for garbage men and
            that area over there, where the old
            cars are kept, prior to being
            processed for shipment to, among
            other places, The Charnier Shipping
            Company, of Marseilles, France.

(NEAR CREMATORIUM)

                         MARIE
            What is that old building?

                         LA VALLE
            Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

                         MARIE
            What was it?

                         LA VALLE
            It was a crematorium.

                         MARIE
            For garbage?

                         LA VALLE
            For dead bodies.

INT. WHIP GIRL'S APT.

Close shot of NICOLI's face.  He's being whipped, and is
caught in an ecstasy of pain and pleasure.  The tempo of the
strokes rises.  Suddenly it reaches a crescendo and he
screams out in orgasm.

Close, full-length shot of a nude BLONDE GIRL, wearing only
black boots and silk panties.  She's walking away from the
camera, throwing aside a small cat-o-nine-tails flagellant
whip.  We can hear NICOLI's heavy breathing until the girl
speaks as she moves toward a couch.

Medium close shot of NICOLI, tying his tie shrugging into
overcoat.

Medium close shot of NICOLI, looking at the bills with a

                         WHIP GIRL
            You're Fifty Dollars short.

The look of anger turns to one of consternation as NICOLI
reacts to her.

                         WHIP GIRL
            M'sieru - the tab for this scene is
            a hundred and a half.

            with the scratch, you're gonna run
            into my man downstairs.

Medium close shot of NICOLI advancing on the WHIP GIRL as
she backs away and begins to cringe.  He grabs her and hurls
her back across the couch.

            This is the new American religion,
            professional football.  It is where
            everybody goes instead of church on
            Sunday to express that peculiar
            American taste for bloodshed and
            violence.

INT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - NIGHT

In Lower Manhattan.  There are SIX or EIGHT MATRONS still
there, stevedores and truck drivers.  Most of them are
clustered at the far end of the bar, where MUTCHIE, a gray-
haired gone-to-paunch Irishman with spectacles as thick as
pop-bottle bottoms stands behind the mahogany bar.  The
cluster of customers is involved in a typical New York
saloon argument.

DOYLE is ignoring the debate and watching the television.
He is approached by a small MAN in a long coat and baggy
suit with suspenders.  This is JESUS THE BOOSTER.

                         JESUS
            Hey, Bo.

                         DOYLE
            Hiya, Jesus.

                         JESUS
            Can you use a new suit for
            Christmans?

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you got?

JESUS reaches into his trousers and pulls out three suits
(jackets and pants).  They are of the latest style and
color, and still on hangers!

                         JESUS
            Whatta you?... a 44... 46?

DOYLE examines one of the jackets.

                                                           42.


                         DOYLE
            Where'd you get this fag shit?

                         JESUS
            This is what the tough guys are
            wearin'.  You know I only steal
            from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.

                         DOYLE
            Pass.

                         JESUS
            Forty dollars -- was $250.

                         DOYLE
            Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and
            burned.

JESUS blends into the crowd and we pick up the dialogue of
MUTCHIE and his cronies, BAD EDDIE, LEE and PUGGY.

                         MUTCHIE
            A big man could alluz beat a little
            man.  That's why Wilt Chamberlain
            could murder Jim Brown if they ever
            fought.

                         BAD EDDIE
            No chance.  Brown'd kill him.

                         MUTCHIE
            Chamberlain's seven foot tall,
            right?  He's got a twelve-foot
            reach.  It's geophysics.  He's
            punchin' down on you with leverage.
            He cave your chest in.

                         BAD EDDIE
            Best I ever seen was The Rock.  He
            was the calmest and the meanest.
            Guys like Sugar'd be pukin' before
            a fight.  Jake LaMotta'd be pukin'.
            Marciano was calm like he was goin'
            to church.  What about the night he
            fought LaStarza?  He hit him so
            hard he broke the blood vessels in
            LaStarza's arms.  He was the
            strongest meanest bastard ever lived.

                         PUGGY
            Hey, Mutchie, give us another bullet.

MUTCHIE pours him a straight Scotch in a shotglass.

                                                           43.


                         MUTCHIE
            Blackjack Burns coulds been the
            greatest ever --

                         PUGGY
            -- He was a stone tanker.

                         MUTCHIE
            That's right, he couldn't fight
            legit.  One night at the Garden
            about 1950, '51 -- he fought either
            Jake LaMotta or Gus Lesnevich, I
            think it was -- he took one o'
            those cream puff punches in the
            sixth -- the laziest left you ever
            seen -- missed him entirely.  Down
            goes Blackjack without even workin'
            up a sweat and the whole Garden
            gets up in its feet and I swear to
            Christ, everybody starts singin'
            "Dance With Me Henry."

                         LEE
            I fought a guy in Cleveland once.
            I knew he was a dirty fighter so I
            stick a crowbar in my crotch.
            Right here.  Second round he gives
            me a shot -- Boom -- he breaks his
            hand, the fight's over.

                         PUGGY
            Fuck it, I like nitroglycerin,
            that's my game.

                         MUTCHIE
            What about you, Doyle?  Who's the
            best fighter you ever seen?

                         DOYLE
                   (a few drinks behind him)
            Willie Mays.

                         BAD EDDIE & LEE
            Willie Mays?!

                         DOYLE
            With a baseball bat!  One swing!
            Knock your fuckin' head off.

TIME LAPSE.  The DRINKERS are gone.  MUTCHIE is at the bar
cleaning up.  DOYLE is in the open adjoining kitchen area
cooking breakfast.

                                                           44.


                         MUTCHIE
            What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin'
            from the cops?

                         DOYLE
            I hear the health department is
            going to close this joint for
            selling dirty beer.  I come by to
            help you carry out your money.

                         MUTCHIE
            They'll close you down if they ever
            get a look at those busted-valise
            broads you run with.

                         DOYLE
            You want some eggs.

                         MUTCHIE
            Why not?

                         DOYLE
                   (looking around for bacon)
            Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah!

                         DOYLE
                   (rattling pans,
                   looking around)
            Where the hell is it?

                         MUTCHIE
            Where the hell do you think it is,
            potato head?

DOYLE opens the door to the icebox.

                         MUTCHIE
            No wonder there's so many Mafia
            around.  Ya couldn't find a Puerto
            Rican in Spanish Harlem.

TIME LAPSE.  Almost morning.  Close on DOYLE and MUTCHIE
eating bacon and eggs.  MUTCHIE is standing behind the bar
as he eats, DOYLE is sitting in front of it.  They both have
a bottle of beer.

                                                           45.


                         MUTCHIE
            I got this little chick I'm tryin'
            to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I
            take her to Jilly's last night and
            she's tellin' me about how she
            wants to settle down one day, get
            married... I says, "Hey, this is
            1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old
            man lookin' to score with some
            pussy."

                         DOYLE
            Strike out, eh?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya
            look like a night's sleep wouldn't
            kill ya.

                         DOYLE
            A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.

                         MUTCHIE
            When ya go back on?

                         DOYLE
            Morning.  Sometime.

                         MUTCHIE
            Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool
            table for a couple hours.  The kid
            comes in at six will wake ya.  A
            couple eggs and a beer is cheaper
            than keepin' a dog around the joint.

EXT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - DAY

Close of DOYLE going to his car.  He stops for a light.
DOYLE is red-eyed and in need of a shave.  He fidgets
through his pockets looking for a cigarette but doesn't find
one.  As he drives along a GIRL CYCLIST comes into view
alongside.

Our view is DOYLE's view of her long, lean tapered legs.  If
he looks further, and DOYLE always looks further, he will
see there is a bra-band sweater covering her well-formed
breasts.  The pendulous swing is there as she bends over the
handlebars.

Close front view of DOYLE looking back to the light, then
back to the legs.

Close outside view, the cyclist, of DOYLE leaning out the
window with his badge in his hand.

                         DOYLE
            You got a pedaller's license?

                         GIRL
            What?

                         DOYLE
            You're under arrest.

            The judge gave you ten days on
            these.  Klein and Mulderig will be
            sitting in for the Federals.  Tell
            Doyle they'll make all the buys,
            and that they're to be kept informed
            of everything that goes down.

SIMONSON turns to MULDERIG.

            disguise is to limp into a room on
            his left foot and limp out on his
            right.  Whose brilliant hunches
            cost the death of a good officer --

Close of RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            If that's how you're coming in, why
            not stay home and save us all a lot
            of grief.

MULDERIG, close.

                         MULDERIG
            That's just my opinion.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Whyn't you shove it up your ass!

EXT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Long shot of RUSSO approaching housing project group of
buildings.  This is where DOYLE lives.

INT. HALLWAY TO DOYLE'S APARTMENT

RUSSO rings the bell.  No response.  He knocks.  Again
nothing.  He hears a shower working inside the apartment.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

No answer.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

                         DOYLE
                   (off, weakly)
            Yeah.

                         RUSSO
            It's Cloudy.  Open the door.

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            I can't.

                                                           48.


                         RUSSO
            Why not?

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            Let yourself in.

RUSSO reaches into his jacket pocket and gets a celluloid
card, his PBA card, which he slides into the door at the
lock.  He gives it a juggle and the lock is free but the
door moves grudgingly.

INT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The door to DOYLE's apartment, a close view from inside.
There's a bike propped against it and BUDDY RUSSO is trying
to push it open from the outside.

                         RUSSO
                   (behind door)
            What the hell you got holding the
            door?

The bike teeters and falls with a crash and RUSSO comes into
the room puzzled, exasperated.

INT. APARTMENT - RUSSO'S POV - DAY

DOYLE is anklecuffed to the bedpost at the foot of the bed.

                         RUSSO
            What happened to you?

                         DOYLE
                   (sleepy)
            The crazy kid handcuffed me to the
            bed.  With my own cuffs.

The shower goes off.  RUSSO puts the bike upright on its
stand and squeezes the horn, which makes a loud beep.

The BIKE GIRL appears in the bathroom door, wrapped in a
towel.

                         BIKE GIRL
            Oh!

RUSSO sees key on dresser - tosses it to DOYLE.  There are
clothes all over the place, the GIRL's cycling outfit,
DOYLE's pants and shoes and socks.  The decor is completely
impersonal.  RUSSO looks up.

                                                           49.


                         RUSSO
                   (looking at scrapbook
                   on dresser)
            You oughta get plastic covers for
            this stuff like I did - your
            scrapbook's a mess like everything
            else in your life.

RUSSO goes to chair.

                         DOYLE
            Gimme my pants.

RUSSO, who is half sitting on them, pulls the pants loose
and hands them to DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            You got the warrant?

                         RUSSO
                   (sitting)
            We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil
            Klein.

Close on DOYLE, buttoning his pants.

                         DOYLE
            What do we need those pricks for?

Medium close on RUSSO picking around through the clothes,
coming up with a pair of panties.  He holds them out.

                         RUSSO
            Because by actual count our bureau
            has exactly nine hundred eighteen
            dollars and fifty-four cents to
            make buys and Mulderig's Feds can
            get all of Uncle Sam's money he
            wants by just asking.

DOYLE sitting on bed, strapping the holster on his ankle.
He checks his gun.

                         DOYLE
            Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you?
            How good are the warrants?

                         RUSSO
                   (on the move down
                   hall, at bathroom door)
            Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

                                                           50.


DOYLE is checking various items that go in his briefcase -
notebook, handcuffs, book of laws, field reports, pencils,
binoculars, candy bars, etc.

Medium close shot of RUSSO looking toward the bathroom door.

                         RUSSO
            Hi!

RUSSO looks back to DOYLE.  There is the sound of a kickstand
being kicked back in place, the door opening and the GIRL
leaving.

Medium close shot of DOYLE tying the shoes, wincing.  Looking
up to the departing GIRL.

                         RUSSO
            Drive carefully!

EXT/INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of BILL MULDERIG in back seat.  BUDDY is in
front, next to DOYLE at the wheel.

                         MULDERIG
            Strictly small potatoes.

We can see DOYLE working to keep up with the black Mercury
as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge in fairly heavy traffic.
The Mercury cuts around in and out, DOYLE plunges after him.

                         MULDERIG
            You really know how to pick 'em,
            Doyle.

RUSSO turns his head in anger.

                         MULDERIG
            Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            Somebody told me the reason you did
            that was so's when you met a chick
            and rubbed against her she wouldn't
            know you were a cop.

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            I said that was bullshit.  It must
            be some kind of fast-draw gimmick
            or something.

                                                           51.


                         RUSSO
            Knock it off, Bill.

                         MULDERIG
            He's gettin' too far ahead.  You're
            gonna lose him.

DOYLE cuts into the next lane to a lot of horn-blowing and
comes to a dead, screeching stop.  DOYLE sits up sharply
erect in the seat, craning to see where SAL is going.  He
throws open the door and hurls himself out.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Rear medium close shot of DOYLE climbing up on the side of
the car to look ahead, then jumping down and running off.

DOYLE running as hard as he can.

Medium close side shot of SAL turning off the bridge onto
the FDR Drive, moving quickly and smoothly uptown.

DOYLE running to a stop, and staring ahead.  Breathing hard,
horns are blowing on the bridge and they drown out the words
as he curses, "Dirty Sonofabitch."

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

RUSSO is on the blower.

                         RUSSO
            Phil -- it's Cloudy -- we lost
            him --

Static comes over the two-way radio.

EXT. BOCA'S CAR COMES OFF RAMP, PAN TO

INT. KLEIN'S CAR - DAY

KLEIN is parked on Pearl Street below the Brooklyn Bridge.

                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            He just got off the Bridge - He's
            all yours if you can find him.
            Sonofabitch!

KLEIN starts his car.

EXT. A PARKING GARAGE IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL emerges from the garage and heads toward Madison Avenue.
He passes a man looking in a store window, PHIL KLEIN.
KLEIN follows him.

                                                           52.


EXT. A STREET IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL stops abruptly at the corner and turns around.  KLEIN is
forced to pass him and cross the street.

SAL crosses the street to his left, at a right angle to KLEIN.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - LATE DAY

SAL moving north on Madison Avenue.  He is walking in a
triangular trap of foot surveillance.  We begin to learn
this when we fall back twenty feet behind SAL and pick up
the figure of JIMMY DOYLE, moving at exactly the same pace.
While he keeps looking forward after SAL, he also looks
regularly to the left, across to the West side of Madison
where we quickly zoom in on the figure of BILL MULDERIG, who
is on an even line opposite SAL and moving almost precisely
in step with the subject of their surveillance.  MULDERIG
keeps an eye on SAL but is also glancing north ahead of SAL
to BUDDY RUSSO, who is 20 or 30 feet ahead of SAL, thus
forming the triangle of the A-B-C tail.

SAL bobbing along.

DOYLE following.

MULDERIG keeping pace.

RUSSO up front.

SAL suddenly turning East at the Northeast corner of 46th
Street, the block occupied by the Roosevelt Hotel.

MULDERIG yanking at his right ear.

RUSSO spinning around, hurrying back toward the corner.

DOYLE turning East at the Southeast corner of 46th Street.

RUSSO coming around the corner looking to DOYLE.

DOYLE indicating the Roosevelt entrance with his chin while
MULDERIG comes up to join DOYLE.

RUSSO moving quickly into the Roosevelt entrance on 46th
Street between Madison and Vanderbilt.

INT. ROOSEVELT LOBBY - DAY

Roosevelt lobby stairs with ALAIN CHARNIER, PIERRE NICOLI,
SAL greeting.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me.

                                                           53.


                         RUSSO
                   (he is moving through
                   the jam they form on
                   the stairs)
            Excuse me.

We move into the lobby of the Roosevelt and then spin around
quickly, to watch CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL moving upstairs
and out the door.

EXT. DAY

A distant view from the Northeast corner of 46th Street and
Madison Avenue of the Roosevelt Hotel marquee and the three
men under it, CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL.  They are in animated
conversation.

DOYLE and MULDERIG on the point-of-view corner across
Madison, MULDERIG with his back to the camera, DOYLE talking
and watching over Mulderig's shoulder.

Close shot DOYLE's face, eyes bright with excitement.

Long view of CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL under the marquee from
DOYLE's view, zooming in on CHARNIER, who continues to talk,
look up, then look back to SAL.

                         DOYLE
            You take Sal.  I'll stick with the
            beard if they split.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Rear view of ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI strolling
slowly down Madison Avenue in the Forties.

An overhead view of the pair, CHARNIER and NICOLI, including
DOYLE 20 or 30 yards behind, RUSSO across the street, even
with him.

CHARNIER and NICOLI window-shopping at Walter's Electric,
49th and 3rd Avenue.

RUSSO looking quizzically, puzzled, from a doorway.

CHARNIER and NICOLI are engaged in a running conversation
that we cannot hear.  But what CHARNIER is saying is simply
that he wants to get a pack of cigarettes before they turn
back and stop for dinner.

RUSSO looking to DOYLE for a signal.

                                                           54.


EXT. A CIGAR STORE - DAY

DOYLE already beginning to feel the cold, rubbing his hands
together, at the front of the place CHARNIER and NICOLI have
entered, trying to figure it out as CHARNIER and NICOLI
emerge, CHARNIER ripping the cellophane off a pack of
cigarettes, and they turn back in DOYLE's direction.

DOYLE, face to face with CHARNIER and NICOLI.  Straining to
hear, he picks up a few words of French.  Without losing
stride he steps off the curb and cuts across the street,
moving south, away from them, as they come north.  But
halfway across the street, we pick up RUSSO coming in his
direction, sharp enough to pick up the tail where DOYLE had
to drop it.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close view through window of ALAIN CHARNIER and
PIERRE NICOLI sitting at a table near the front windows of a
small restaurant.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A long shot of street zooming in on JIMMY DOYLE who is
freezing his ass off in the shadows of a doorway across the
street from the restaurant.  He is dancing from one foot to
the other, his shoulders hunched, occasionally cupping his
hands to his ears.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

A medium close shot of WAITER holding a bottle of Sainte
Emillion out for CHARNIER's inspection.  CHARNIER looks,
frowns, shakes head negatively.

DOYLE's feet.  He's standing on one foot, the other raised
and he's squeezing it with a chapped hand, as if trying to
get circulation back into it.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close shot of NICOLI watching the WAITER scoop coq au
vin onto his plate.

Close shot of CHARNIER taking a large forkful of food into
his mouth, chewing and nodding at NICOLI.

Medium close shot of RUSSO standing in front of DOYLE while
DOYLE fishes a piece of pizza out of the bag and lets it
fold into his mouth, then licks his fingers.

                         RUSSO
            You want the red or the white?

                         DOYLE
            Pour it in your ear.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close view of CHARNIER through the window of the
restaurant, sipping expresso.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Close shot of the pastry tray, rows of Napoleons, strawberry
and peach tarts, a frothing-frenzied rum cake, etc.

NICOLI close, looking like he's about to have an orgasm,
glancing toward CHARNIER and then the tray.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Close shot of RUSSO peering at the restaurant.  DOYLE's face
right behind him, peering over RUSSO's shoulder, trying to
drink coffee from a paper container and also moving slightly
against the cold and the pain of the shoes.

EXT. FIRST AVENUE - DAY (EXT. COPAIN)

Rear long view of CHARNIER and NICOLI on Madison in the
Forties strolling to a corner where NICOLI is splitting for
the Edison Hotel (West 46th Street) while CHARNIER goes on
to the Westbury on upper Madison.  They part with a wave and
a nod.  Hold on them as BUDDY RUSSO comes into view, moving
off after NICOLI.  DOYLE follow CHARNIER.

Medium close shot of DOYLE leaning on elbow on the counter,
half-turned to keep an eye on the elevators.

                         DOYLE
            That guy just walked in.  What's
            his name?

Close on CLERK and DOYLE.

                         DESK CLERK
            I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.

                         DOYLE
                   (showing badge)
            He got off on six.

                         DESK CLERK
            We have four rooms and six suites
            on six.  There's a man in almost
            every one of them.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Little shorter than me.  Well-
            dressed.  About forty-five or fifty
            with salt-and-pepper hair, a beard.

Close of CLERK.  Thinks it over.

                         DESK CLERK
            There's nobody like that on six.

DOYLE AND CLERK

                         DESK CLERK
            Perhaps he's visiting a guest.

                         DOYLE
            No, I figure he stays here.  Where's
            your registration?

CLERK gets out registration log book, goes through list as
DOYLE waits.

                         DESK CLERK
            There may be two... no, three who
            could fit it.

                         DOYLE
            Names.

                                                           57.

            A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here
            alone.

                         DOYLE
            Where from?

                         DESK CLERK
            Des Moines.

                         DOYLE
            What's he do?

                         DESK CLERK
            Businessman.  Owns a department
            store in Des Moines, I think.

DOYLE is taking down the information on a pad.

                         DESK CLERK
            Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would
            be another.  He's in shipping.

                         DOYLE
            Yeh?  Who else?

                         DESK CLERK
            And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I
            don't know what he does.

                         DOYLE
            This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?

                         DESK CLERK
            I think so.  But they're in Room
            408.  On the fourth floor.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE

                         DESK CLERK
            That's in France.

                         DOYLE
            Yeah, I know.

EXT. WESTBURY HOTEL ON MADISON AVENUE - NIGHT

Medium close shot of DOYLE standing in another doorway, this
one in Madison Avenue, opposite and a little up the street
from the Westbury.  It is about 2 o'clock in the morning and
there's not much traffic.  DOYLE looks like a man almost too
tired to stand.  We hear a car pull up (off camera).

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - NIGHT

View from the front seat of a sedan of DOYLE falling into
the corner of the back seat.  RUSSO reaches across the seat
from the camera to hand DOYLE a brown paper container of
coffee.  He opens it between his knees and scalds his mouth
with it.  RUSSO hands over another gift, a pint of Canadian
Club.  DOYLE takes a big swig.

Rear close view of BILL MULDERIG at the wheel of the car,
looking at DOYLE in the rear-view mirror.

                         MULDERIG
            You about ready for a break?

A view of MULDERIG at the wheel, RUSSO twisted around in the
seat, looking back at DOYLE and putting the cap back on the
bottle.  When DOYLE isn't sipping at the coffee-whiskey,
he's looking out the window of the car at the entrance of
the hotel.  He looks beat.

                         DOYLE
            The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure.
            Also he made me.  Stayin' on four
            but went up to six -- cute.

                         RUSSO
            The other guy's a frog too.  Checked
            in at the Edison.  Had a hooker
            sent up.

                         MULDERIG
            Christ you should o' collared him
            right there.

                         DOYLE
            Who's on him?

                         RUSSO
            Phil Klein.

                                                           59.


                         DOYLE
            What about Sal?

RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            We put him to bed for the night.

MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
            You look like shit.

DOYLE AND MULDERIG - INTERCUT

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Look.  My partner and I found this
            case and I don't want no Feds
            screwing it up.

                         MULDERIG
            Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn
            thing.

                         DOYLE
            Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off
            and I'll knock you into the middle
            of next week.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Jimmy, cool it.  Nothin's goin'
            down tonight.  Cop a few zzz's
            while you can.

Close shot, DOYLE.

INT. WEINSTOCK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Close shot of CHEMIST with a small lab layout spread in
front of him -- burner, test tubes, etc.  The MAN's wearing
an ordinary business suit and both the table and the
background indicate that this is not a lab, but somebody's
library or den -- and a fashionable one, with photos, a
signed picture of Lyndon Johnson, etc., on the panelled walls.

The CHEMIST is running a Thiele test on a small mound of
powder.  Heroin from CHARNIER's shipment.

Medium close shot of JOEL WEINSTOCK and SAL BOCA sitting
opposite the CHEMIST.

                                                           60.


SAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy
snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are
interested; SAL quite nervously.

The CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the
size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin.

He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister
test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny
alcohol lamp.

He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case,
fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the
heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.

He places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open
rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the
burnmeister tube, about three inches in.

With a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp.

We watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the
white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the
mineral oil and

The mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220° - 230°.

The faces of the three men are filled with wonder and
anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a
cheering section, rooting the hometeam home.

The longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer
the heroin.  The mercury stops at 240°!

                         CHEMIST
            Absolutely dynamite!  89.5 proof!
            Best I've ever seen!  If the rest
            is like this, you'll be dealing for
            two years on this load.

Close on WEINSTOCK, relaxed, smoking a large cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Retail is not my end of the business.
            Are you telling me it's worth the
            half million?

Medium close of the CHEMIST.

                         CHEMIST
            How many kilos?

                         SAL
            Sixty.

                                                           61.


                         CHEMIST
            Six kilos at eight big ones a
            kilo...
                   (he nods)
            I'd say it should be able to take a
            seven to one hit in the street.

                         SAL
            By the time it gets down to nickel
            bags it's at least thirty-two
            million!

Medium close of WEINSTOCK and BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Thank you, Howard.  Take what's
            left there with you and goodnight.

The CHEMIST packs his apparatus and leaves.

                         SAL
            I guess we got a deal, eh?

Medium close shot of WEINSTOCK alone, appraising BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            We got a test.  A deal for half a
            million dollars, maybe.

SAL, whose cool is easily shattered.

                         SAL
            Joel, the man is in a hurry.  He
            wants the bread and he wants to go
            back to France.  He ain't gonna
            hang around and play games.  He's
            one o' the shrewdest cats I ever
            run across.

WEINSTOCK, close.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What am I, a shmuck?  What's the
            hurry?  He could see a couple of
            shows and visit the top of the
            Empire State Building.

INTERCUT SAL, WEINSTOCK

                         SAL
            Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot
            o' time settin' this one up.

                                                           62.


                         WEINSTOCK
            So whatta you want a badge?  It's
            your first major league game Sal.
            One thing I learned, move calmly,
            move cautiously.  You'll never be
            sorry.

                         SAL
            I been damn careful up to now.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Which is why your phone lines are
            tapped and the Feds are crawlin'
            all over you like flies.

                         SAL
            I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't
            got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin'
            you, he'll take the deal somewhere
            else.

WEINSTOCK

                         WEINSTOCK
            He could go someplace else with his
            sixty kilos of heroin and see how
            easy it is to pull together a half
            million cash.  He wouldn't find
            there was any hurry to do this kind
            of business.

SAL, a little desperate.

                         SAL
            Look, the stuff is here.  We could
            set up the switch in an hour.  I'm
            tellin' you, Mr. Weinstock, he'll
            split if we don't move.  This guy
            is everything they say he is.

WEINSTOCK taking SAL apart with his eyes over the cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What about you, Sal?  Are you
            everything they say you are?

Close of SAL's worried face.

            No.

            Then how come you're leaning on it.

Close shot of HOOKER.

                         DOYLE

DOYLE looking right and left, the form of the GIRL climbing
into the vehicle.  He puts surveillance hat on back seat.

INT. DAN'S LUNCH - DAY

DOYLE is standing at an island counter in a coffee-doughnuts
joint.  The COUNTERMAN is paying no attention to him but is
instead emptying coffee from a large dispenser into a pot.

                         DOYLE
            You gonna wait on me or am I gonna
            sit here all day?

The COUNTERMAN responds quickly to DOYLE's voice.

A kid pushes a broom past, getting rid of a collection of
cigarette butts, etc.

                         KID
            What you mean?

                         DOYLE
            You still dealin' shit?

                         KID
            Jesus, no, Doyle.  I'm clean.  I'm
            working twelve hours a day here.

Close shot of DOYLE talking around a mouthful of doughnut.

                         DOYLE
            When they going to make you chairman
            of the board?

Medium close shot of DOYLE and the KID.  DOYLE puts down the
coffee cup.  Waves the KID closer.  The KID moves closer,
DOYLE frisks him quickly, expertly, then rips up the kid's
jacket and takes a 12-inch toadsticker out of the kid's
waistband.

Close shot of DOYLE looking at the knife, snapping the
button and watching the blade flash out.

                         DOYLE
            You clean your fingernails with this.

Close shot of KID.

                         KID

DOYLE, pushing button and letting the blade fall into closed
position.

                         DOYLE
            Yeah, I guess so.

DOYLE hands the knife back to the kid.  HECTOR goes back to
work.  DOYLE eats.

DOYLE climbing back into his car, knees on the seat, reaching
over into the back.

Close shot over the rear seat of DOYLE picking up the straw
hat, which has been jammed into the corner by the contours
of the Hooker's tail.  He straightens it as much as possible
and throws it under the driver's seat.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Medium shot of DOYLE on foot popeyeing up Madison Avenue in
the vicinity of the Westbury.  As unobtrusively as possible,
he's looking for the tail that should be there covering
CHARNIER.  DOYLE is on the East side of the street, and the
Westbury is on the West.  He pokes his head into a couple of
doorways, checks the cars parked at the curb, looks up to a
couple of the mezzanine shops along the street.  He sees
PHIL KLEIN and ANOTHER AGENT talking together totally
oblivious to the front entrance.  MULDERIG in a cigar store
looks to his wristwatch, then goes inside the store.

Close shot of DOYLE frowning, puzzled.  There doesn't seem
to be anybody alert.  He looks over to the hotel.

Westbury Hotel entrance from DOYLE's Point of View.  CHARNIER
steps out of hotel entrance, turns south.  The two AGENTS
and MULDERIG have not seen his exit.

Close on DOYLE in a doorway.

CHARNIER, carrying an umbrella, strolling blithely down the
street, in DOYLE's direction but on the opposite side of the
street.  Zoom in on his face, reflecting no concern, no
problems, then zoom back to DOYLE's position.  Pan to the
hotel entrance as DOYLE looks for somebody else.  Where the
hell is CHARNIER's surveillance?

Very quickly, DOYLE's nervous glances.

CHARNIER close.

A long view of the street.

at the Times, glancing toward the tracks and the rumble of a
train in the distance.

Side rear view of CHARNIER close in the foreground, DOYLE
moving into view in the background, not looking toward
CHARNIER, keeping his face turned mostly away from the
Frenchman.

MULDERIG in phone booth at Westbury.

                         MULDERIG
            Yeah, we got the Westbury covered
            like a tent.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him
            down at the subway at Times Square.
            What the hell's goin' on?  I make
            him coming right out of the hotel
            free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.

Close shot of CHARNIER strolling past the telephone booth,
DOYLE looking down.

                         DOYLE
            I don't care how many bartenders
            are sick.  I don't work in that
            joint.  What the hell kind of a
            union are you running down there?

Long view of CHARNIER and DOYLE about thirty feet apart on
the platform, a second train approaching.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN

reappears on the platform.  DOYLE steps off.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Close view of subway doors hissing shut and an umbrella
being raised at the last moment by an off-camera hand
(CHARNIER's).  The doors jerk open in the safety spasm.
There is a blur of the a fabric moving across the camera,
blocking the view of the doors.  It is only a moment.  When
it clears, the doors are closed again, the umbrella is gone.
But we don't know what happened and the train isn't moving.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DOYLE'S CAR

Rear close view of DOYLE peeking into the forward car to see
where CHARNIER is sitting.

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Quick, shocked close view of that car, revealing that
CHARNIER isn't there among the twenty passengers dozing or
moping in their seats.  There is a blurred flash as if
DOYLE's own eyes are spinning frantically back to the
windows of his own car.

A view from CHARNIER's position of DOYLE chasing the train,
anger and hatred and frustration storming across his face.

EXT. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY - MOSHOLU EXIT

A long view from the bottom of the steep embankments above
Harlem River Drive in Washington Heights.  Sprayed along the
face of the cliff is a disaster -- an overturned city bus
and a car with which it apparently collided.  The scene is
lighted with flares.  Police rescue WORKERS and FIREMEN are
scrambling up and down the face of the cliff.  They are
carrying BODIES out of the bus and the car, COPS pulling
them out through the windows, leading them on stretchers.
There are shouted orders and some moans and cries from the
wreckage.  In the foreground is LT. WALTER SIMONSON, involved
in the operation, but also involved in a hassle with DOYLE,
MULDERIG and RUSSO who are standing with him.  An officer
approaches SIMONSON with a set of heroin works.

                                                           69.


                         OFFICER
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This belonged to the kid who was
            drivin' the sports car.  17 years
            old.  His girlfriend OD'd in the
            car.  We found this set of works in
            her arm.

Medium close shot of DOYLE and SIMONSON.  DOYLE couldn't
care if Rome was burning on the hill; he's only interested
in his case.

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Where the hell was the surveillance?
            "Go to bed." That's all you could
            say.  You couldn't keep track of a
            bleeding elephant in a snowbank.

SIMONSON, eyes on the hill, glancing to DOYLE with irritation.

                         SIMONSON
            Jimmy, it doesn't matter anymore.
            If there was a deal it must have
            gone down by now.  We blew it!  We
            blew our cover and we blew the
            warrants --

                         MULDERIG
            Charnier and his wife checked out
            of the Westbury.  Nicoli checked

            This fella Nicoli's got a record in
            France, Walter.  He's wanted for
            questioning in the murder of a
            French cop.

                         DOYLE
            I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

                         MULDERIG
            That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in
            the subway and you blew our cover.
            If they haven't moved already
            they're not gonna move now.

                         DOYLE
            Walter, I can make this case if the
            Feds will get the hell out of my way.

                                                           70.


                         MULDERIG
            With pleasure -- it's all yours.
            Walter, if anything develops outta
            this charade give me a call.

Medium shot of SIMONSON, DOYLE, MULDERIG and RUSSO.  Lights
flashing around them; stretchers going by with bodies.

                         RUSSO
                   (to MULDERIG)
            My ass.  The only reason you're in
            this is because you've got a big
            expense account for buying junk and
            you like to see your picture in the
            papers.

                         DOYLE
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This is my case.  Get these guys
            off my back and let me handle it.

SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
            For chrissake, will you come off
            that "my case" bullshit.  This has
            been a whore's dream from the start.

DOYLE, close.

                         DOYLE
            The deal hasn't gone down yet
            Walter -- I know it, I can feel it.

Close shot of MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            The last time you were dead certain
            we ended up with a dead cop.

A fist, DOYLE's, comes from off-camera and connects with
MULDERIG's chin.  As his head flies back.

DOYLE and MULDERIG slugging and grappling with each other,
RUSSO leaping in to yank them apart.  SIMONSON grabbing
MULDERIG's arm and holding him back.

SIMONSON, close.

                         SIMONSON
                   (roaring)
            That's enough.  Get the hell out of
            here.

                                                           71.

                   turning back)
            Jimmy, you wasted two months - no
            collars are comin' in while you two
            been out jerkin' off.  Now go back

the shuttle line.

EXT. DEPT. OF COMMERCE, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

CHARNIER and an UNDERSECRETARY on the steps of the building,
shaking hands.  Two other OFFICIALS are on hand and while we
don't hear their conversation, their manner is extremely
attentive to CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            It has been highly informative and
            a personal pleasure to see you again.

                         UNDERSECRETARY
            I only hope we cut through to some
            meaningful proposals in the next
            month or so.  The pleasure was
            mine, Mr. Charnier.  When will we
            see you again?

                         CHARNIER
            Soon, probably in the Spring.

                                                           72.


Close shot of CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            Goodbye.

                         UNDERSECRETARY
                   (off camera)
            Goodbye.  Good trip home.

Rear close shot of CHARNIER joining SAL BOCA on the sidewalk
and the two of them moving off together.

Close shot of SAL, somewhat nervous about trying to peddle
his problems to CHARNIER.

                         SAL
            Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I
            will need a few more days though,
            the boys think we oughta cool it
            for awhile -- make sure there's no
            heat.

                         CHARNIER
                   (manner outwardly pleasant)
            You must take me for an imbecile.
            Why do you think I asked you to
            meet me in Washington?  I haven't
            spent five minutes in New York City
            without the company of a gendarme.

                         SAL
            Look, I'll level with you -- I need
            a little more time -- I got to
            shift gears.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you having trouble raising the
            half million?

                         SAL
            Hell no -- my end is covered -- my
            associates just feel we ought to
            wait for a more opportune time to
            make the switch.

Stop, Cover.

                                                           73.


                         CHARNIER
            It has to be by the end of this week.

                         SAL
            Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be
            reasonable.

                         CHARNIER
            It's your problem.

                         SAL
            It's yours too!

Full length shot of CHARNIER and BOCA, CHARNIER leaning over
to shake his hand.

                         CHARNIER
            So nice to have seen you again.

CHARNIER turns and walks off, leaving SAL looking after him
as we zoom back to a Point of View about a hundred yards
down the street.

Close of PHIL KLEIN, just watching.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Close shot of MRS. CHARNIER, sitting by the window of two
seats on the shuttle, looking out and babbling at CHARNIER.
(DIALOGUE IN FRENCH).

                         MARIE
            Look, darling, they sell these at
            the Smithsonian.

She extracts a necklace and bracelet of shark's teeth from
an elegant alligator bag.

Camera moves back to take in CHARNIER looking from the Wall
Street Journal to the native craft bracelets.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you sure it is dead?

                         MARIE
            I'm going to put them on the cat.

                         CHARNIER
            That's a relief.

Close shot of CHARNIER, tenderly, lovingly.

                                                           74.


                         CHARNIER
            You did find something for yourself,
            of course.

MARIE, close.

                         MARIE
            Of course.  But I am not going to
            tell you what it is until we are
            back in Marseilles.

CHARNIER and MARIE.  He folds up the paper, smiling at her.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me a moment, darling.

CHARNIER's view of the plane interior, walking back toward
the rear of the cabin.  The seats are occupied by military-
business-government TYPES making the shuttle run.  Not every
seat is filled.  We come to an empty one on which someone
has deposited an attache case.  It is the seat next to
PIERRE NICOLI, whose hand reaches out to remove it and we
follow the arm to NICOLI's face.

Close shot of CHARNIER and NICOLI sitting. (DIALOGUE IN
FRENCH)

                         CHARNIER
            I'm afraid they've become a bit...
            over-cautious.  Our American friends.

                         NICOLI
            What happens to the schedule?

                         CHARNIER
            We must follow it.

                         NICOLI
            But will they?

CHARNIER shrugs.

                         CHARNIER
            I don't know.  Boca is scared.
            He's not strong enough.  He sees
            policemen in his soup.

                         NICOLI
            He is not wrong.

                         CHARNIER
            Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed
            me on the subway, he's the eager one.

                                                           75.


                         NICOLI
            Let me take him out.

Close of CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            There'll be someone else.

                         NICOLI
            What difference does it make?
            We'll be out of the country Friday.

Close shot of CHARNIER alone.

EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE DOYLE'S APARTMENT BLDG. - DAY

A complex of buildings similar to Lefrak City.  A medium
close view of a LITTLE GIRL about to run DOYLE down with a
two-wheel bicycle.  Two shots ring out in quick succession
and tear up the concrete at a point where he would have been
walking a moment earlier.

DOYLE diving for the cover of a tree.  The rifle goes off a
third time and MOTHERS begin to scream on the benches of the
playground area.

                         DOYLE
                   (yelling)
            Everybody, down!  Get down on the
            ground!

DOYLE behind the tree, pulling his gun out of the ankle
holster.  He holds the gun ready and tries to look around.
Ping, another shot that drives him back.

Long panning view, DOYLE's view, from the ground, of all the
rooftops in the area.  A blank.  The background sound is
still screaming crying. "Call the police." "The man's got a
gun." "Help!  Help!" The view is still slow, careful under
the pressure of the panic.  There's another shot.

Long shot of rifle smoke rising from NICOLI's sniper position.

Exterior view of the concrete tunnels, DOYLE running from
them toward the building, dodging and ducking behind
playground equipment and benches as he does.  He's shouting
as he runs.

                         DOYLE
            Get down!  It's a sniper.  Get down!

Medium shot of DOYLE dashing into the lobby of his building
to a Spanish kid in the window of building.

Exterior shot of rooftop door opening slowly, DOYLE coming
through the opening, gun at the ready.

Panning shot of the rooftop, DOYLE's view, stopping for a
beat at the rifle and box of cartridges lying beside the
parapet, moving on.  The roof's empty.  DOYLE sees NICOLI
below, grabs rifle and cartridge.

DOYLE running to the parapet, looking over.

Shot of the street, traffic, elevated tracks in the distance.
Long searching look of the streets and the people.  The
view, which is DOYLE's, passes over one man in a dark suit,
stops and goes back.  Zap!  It's NICOLI walking quickly but
not in any panic toward the El.

DOYLE's face.  He runs to parapet, fires at NICOLI.  Misses.

DOYLE running across the roof and through the door.

DOYLE bursting out of the elevator at the bottom, through a
crowd of WOMEN and KIDS who scream as they did in the
playground.

Medium close view of DOYLE running as fast as he can.

right in front of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Stop that guy.  He's wanted by the
            police!

Side medium close shot of DOYLE turning and plunging back
through the doorway of platform exit.

INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

In one corner of the train is a transit policeman.  He's
observed Doyle shouting and gesturing at NICOLI who sits
nervously aware of the policeman's presence.  Long longs
between them.  Finally, the officer decides to approach
NICOLI.

NICOLI panics and runs.  The officer goes after him and
traps him against the door between cars.

INT. TOKEN BOOTH - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE with badge at token booth.

                         DOYLE
            Where's the next stop?  Going into
            the city?

                         TOKEN ATTENDANT
                   (glancing out in
                   direction the train

open.

                         DOYLE
            Police!

Medium close shot of DOYLE dragging MIDDLE-AGED MALE DRIVER
out from behind the wheel as he shouts.

                         DRIVER
            What the hell?

                         DOYLE
                   (diving behind the wheel)
            Police!  Emergency!

            Blind sonofabitch!

            next station!

                         MOTORMAN
            I got to stop.

                         NICOLI
            Touch the brake and I'll blow you
            in half.

                         MOTORMAN
            The signal lights are automatic.
            If I go through a red I'll be
            automatically braked.

The MOTORMAN pales, his hand goes to his left side in a
gesture of anxiety, possibly pain.

                                                           79.

stopping.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Medium close shot of CROWD on train pushing toward the
MOTORMAN's cab.  They are upset over the missed stop.  The
CONDUCTOR seems to be the most annoyed.

He's pushing hardest toward the camera to complain.

                         VOICES
            Didn't stop.
            Went right through there...
            Hey, man, that's my station...
            Where the hell's he going?
            Hey, stop the car...

Close shot of NICOLI's back, half in the MOTORMAN's cab, as
he faces the CROWD.  Now the cries turn to:

                         VOICES
            He's got a gun...
            The motorman's gone crazy...
            Oh my God!

                         NICOLI
            Get back.

                         CONDUCTOR
            Hey, you can't...

Side view of NICOLI, the MOTORMAN in the background the
CONDUCTOR leaping at NICOLI.  NICOLI burns him; one gut shot.
The car turns to pandemonium of screams.  The CONDUCTOR is
hurled back into the crowd by force of the blast.  The
MOTORMAN throws back his head in fright, and the beginning
of a coronary.

EXT/INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE from back seat, twisting, turning the
car in a wild demonstration of pursuit driving around cars,

                                                           80.


We move out through the windshield for a lurching, spinning,
twisting view of the tracks overhead, the street signs and
lights flashing by in a reeling montage of movement, the
train roaring above it all.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Close side shot of NICOLI turning to cover the MOTORMAN, who
is clutching in pain, slumping toward the controls.

                         MOTORMAN
                   (gasping)
            I can't breathe.

NICOLI glances quickly to his left, out the window to the
next station.

Long, low view of the tracks, partially NICOLI's view.
There are red blinkers on the side of the tracks.  Red
lights up ahead.  That's the back of another train.  It has
stopped and we're hurtling toward it.

Wide shot of screaming pack of subway riders, fighting their
way back from NICOLI, succeeding only in turning themselves
into a tightly contained mob.  Now the words they cry are:

The leader train sits waiting about twenty yards out of the
station.  As the onrushing train approaches, it passes
through the yellow signal light at the rear of the station.

EXT. CLOSE SHOT THE TRIP LOCK - DAY

As the onrushing car pulls equal to the red signal light at
the front of the station, the tiny trip lock on the track
springs up, activating the safety brake.  The trains avoid
collision by a few feet as the front car screeches to a halt.

INT. THE ONRUSHING TRAIN - DAY

The passengers are thrown violently to the ground.

NICOLI gets to his feet and forces open one of the doors.

EXT. 62ND STREET TRACKS - DAY

NICOLI makes his way out of the train and runs along the
tracks for a few yards, narrowly avoiding the third rail.
He climbs onto the station platform, to the shock and
amazement of several onlookers.  He is dazed and disheveled,
no longer a hunter.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE 62ND STREET STATION - DAY

NICOLI staggers down the stairs to the street, unarmed.

DOYLE is waiting at the foot of the stairs.

NICOLI sees him, turns in desperation to run back up.

EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car to the street.  We
can see the Lincoln.  The lights of a car appear on the left
and come down the street past the Lincoln, slowly, like a
man looking for a place to park.  We can make out, but just
barely with the help of the street lights, four people in
the car.

DOYLE in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner
of the Lincoln in the background.  While we are looking in
silence, there is a glimmering flow in the far corner, the
beginning of approaching headlights again.  They grown
brighter and DOYLE's foreground profile turns to watch it
come.

                         DOYLE
                   (softly)
            Same car.

                         RUSSO
            Third time around.

RUSSO and MULDERIG straightening up, leaning close to window
to peer out.

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car of the approaching
vehicle, which suddenly switches off its lights and turns on
its parking blinkers.  It comes abreast of the Lincoln and
stops.  The men get out and chase the Lincoln.

View through windshield at the four men.  DOYLE is now up
straight and at the wheel.  He's leaning forward, his hand
on the key of the car.  He glances back to MULDERIG.

                         DOYLE
                   (to car radio)
            Let's him 'em.

View of the hood.  All hell breaks loose, headlights,
including DOYLE's flash on and form a spotlight on the
Lincoln and the figures around it.  Frozen in the headlights,
confused, startled, and disbelieving are FIVE PUERTO RICANS
with a variety of auto-stripping tools in their hands: lug
wrenches, tire irons, pinch bars, monkey wrenches, etc.
DOYLE drives right up to them.  The camera leaps out of the
car with him and runs toward the men.  We hear voices
shouting.

                         VOICES
            Police!  Don't move... get you...
            hands up... you're under arrest...

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Close view of DOYLE holding his gun on one of the terrorized-
looking Puerto Ricans.  The KID's hands are rising
tentatively.  He's too scared to move.

                         DOYLE
            Up!  Up, you sonofabitch!

In the background, the scene is being duplicated by two or
three others.

Overhead view of this headlight and flashlight arena of
about 10 or 12 DETECTIVES forming small clusters, throwing
these guys up against cars, pulling their arms around behind
them and throwing cuffs on them while others rapidly frisk
them for weapons, taking away one pistol, a couple of knives.

MULDERIG and DOYLE looking at their MAN up against the
Lincoln as RUSSO finishes snapping handcuffs on him.

                         DOYLE
            Of all the goddam cars they had to
            pick to steal hubcaps.

Close shot of the front end of the Lincoln, upended on a
hoist attached to a police tow truck.  The area is less
brightly lighted by headlights now.  Some cars have departed
with the Puerto Rican AUTO STRIPPERS.  DOYLE's interest
focuses on the car.  We pick him up as we pan to him sitting
on the running board of the tow truck, talking with its
DRIVER, who is making a report on a clipboard.  MULDERIG and
RUSSO are standing nearby, talking to TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

                         DOYLE
                   (looking up and around)
            A bunch of lousy little spic car
            thieves.

                         MULDERIG
            Nothing in there except a New York
            street map.

                         DOYLE
            Tumble it.  One end to the other.

RUSSO jotting in his note pad, then glancing up to the off-
camera DOYLE.

DOYLE, medium close, hands jamming into his pockets, staring
at the ground with RUSSO and MULDERIG.

                                                           86.


INT. POLICE GARAGE - DAY

A montage as the Lincoln is being disassembled.  First it is
weighed.  We then see the MECHANIC drain the gas, pull apart
the transmission and check through the brake drums, rip out
the seats.

MECHANIC ducking out from under the car, moving toward off-
camera DOYLE.

                         MECHANIC
            Nobody's been under there with
            anything but a grease gun since if
            came off the line.

DOYLE's hand reaches out from off-camera and takes a
cigarette package out of the MECHANIC's pocket.

                         DOYLE
            I don't buy it.  The stuff is on
            this car.

                         MECHANIC
            Then you find it.  I can't.

INT. POLICE SERGEANT'S OFFICE AT GARAGE - DAY

Shot of DEVEREAUX and LA VALLE.

                         LA VALLE
            The car was lost sometime this
            evening.  First they send us to
            Pier One -- then they send us
            here --

                         DESK SERGEANT
            I don't understand why you had it
            parked on the waterfront.  You're
            staying at the Doral and you lose
            your car somewhere out by the
            Brooklyn Bridge.

                         LA VALLE
            In point of fact, M. Devereaux is
            scouting locations for a film for
            French Television.  He left the car
            to look at some point of interest.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving, excitable)
            We were told by the Police
            Commissioner's office that the car
            was brought to this garage.  I
            demand its immediate return.

                                                           87.


                         DESK SERGEANT
            If you'll be patient, Mr. Devereaux.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving)
            I have been patient enough.  There
            is no reason I should have to waste
            time with this red tape.

                         LA VALLE
            Mr. Devereaux is an extremely
            important guest of this country.
            He is working with the absolute
            cooperation and participation of
            your government.  Here are his
            credentials from the French
            Consulate.
                   (showing them)
            Unless you wish to see this episode
            portrayed in his film I suggest you
            locate his car immediately.

Police MECHANIC in background.

                         MECHANIC
            What are you looking for?  Is it as
            big as an orange or an elephant's
            ass?  I've been over every inch --
            top to bottom.  If you could give
            me a club -- to the size...

                         RUSSO
                   (doing rough figures
                   on a piece of scratch paper)
            What was the weight of the car when
            you got it, Irv?

                         MECHANIC
                   (consulting his notes)
            4,839 pounds.

                         RUSSO
                   (consulting Lincoln
                   Specification Book)
            You're sure?
                   (he does quick addition)
            The manufacturer's spec says it
            should weigh 4,719 pounds.  This
            one's carrying roughly 120 extra
            pounds somewhere.

He produces a copy of a ship's manifold.

                                                           88.


                         RUSSO
            When it was booked in at Marseilles
            it weighed the same.  120 pounds
            overweight.  Jimmy has to be right.

The THREE MEN turn again to stare at the Lincoln.  The
MECHANIC lowers the hoist, thoughtfully.

                         MECHANIC
            I ripped everything out except the
            Rocker panels.

                         DEVEREAUX
            What's that?

They look at each other for a long moment.

MECHANIC starts to undo the side Rocker pans.  JIMMY pulls
the pan off and sticks his arm into the enclosure.  Feeling
around inside he pulls out the first kilo-sized plastic
container as several others start tumbling out after.  BUDDY
and DOYLE are smiling at each other as they continue to pull
the bags out.  Several of the other MECHANICS in the garage
are gathered around the happy moment.  They repeat this
action on the other side of the car.

RUSSO enters garage sergeant's bullpen.  DEVEREAUX and LA
VALLE are still arguing with the SERGEANT.

                         RUSSO
            Got it for you, Randy -- it just
            came in from downtown.  Who's
            Devereaux?

                         LA VALLE
            This is M. Devereaux.

                         RUSSO
            I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we
            get reports on a couple hundred
            vehicles a night.  Sometimes it's a
            little tough to keep track.

                         DEVEREAUX
            You mean the car's here now?

                         RUSSO
            Yeah -- fine -- it's okay -- not
            even a scratch.  You're all set.
                   (handing DEVEREAUX keys)

                         RUSSO
            Someone stole it right off the
            street, huh?  You're gonna have to
            pay the tow away charge.

                         DEVEREAUX
            I was told these things happen in
            New York -- but one never expects it.

                         RUSSO
            Yeah.  Well, it's in perfect shape.
            You must lead a charming life.

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX turning to face CHARNIER, who
has been waiting for him.

                         CHARNIER
            Did you pick up the car?

                         DEVEREAUX
            It is waiting for you in the garage.

                         CHARNIER
            Did they follow you?

                         DEVEREAUX
            I wasn't looking.

                         CHARNIER
            Henri... I need one more favor from
            you.  I know I am imposing...

                         DEVEREAUX
            My friend, I am not sure about what
            is going on -- but for me, I am
            finished.

                         CHARNIER
            Not quite -- you are in it whether
            you like it or not.  The police
            know you brought the car into the
            country.  This makes you an
            accomplice.

                                                           90.


                         DEVEREAUX
            An accomplice to what?!  What have
            you gotten me into, Alain?  You
            asked me to do you a favor -- and I
            did what you asked -- but you've
            taken advantage of me.  I have my
            reputation --

CHARNIER pulls DEVEREAUX further aside.

                         CHARNIER
            Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust
            me -- this is an extremely
            complicated situation to which
            there is a simple solution if you
            do exactly what I tell you.  It's
            worth more money to you.

                         DEVEREAUX
            Goodbye.

DEVEREAUX turns and walks into the crowded lobby leaving
ALAIN standing alone.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Medium close shot of the Lincoln.  The Rocker panels are
open and the junk is being unloaded.  CHARNIER is standing
by two suitcases of cash.  He takes a bundle out of the

sure it's money all the way through; puts it in a separate
stack that will go into the rocker panels of a nearby junk

Crematorium.

EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

After a chase around the graveyard RUSSO burns SAL who dies
among the wrecked cars.

WEINSTOCK and the CHEMIST emerge from the cars.  Hands in

            He's gone, Jimmy.  Bill is dead.

DOYLE full figure, close.  A long pause -- and then --

                         DOYLE
            The sonofabitch is in here somewhere.
            I saw him -- I'm gonna get him.

DOYLE exits down the corridor.  The others staring after him.

EXT. CREMATORIUM

Within the building no one is visible.  Overhead, the
Hellgate Bridge, sounds of New York, jets, auto traffic, and
an approaching Penn Central train.

EXT. A BAR IN BED-STUY - DAY

A large man in a Santa Claus suit and white beard is
entertaining a group of black children.  He leads them in
the singing of a Christmas Carol (Hark the Herald Angels
Sing).  The man is DETECTIVE FIRST GRADE JIMMY DOYLE.  His
attention is split between the children and the activity
inside the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DOYLE'S POV - DAY

The place is crowded with mid-day drinkers.  Dimly outlined
at the far end of the bar are TWO BLACK MEN involved in some
kind of transaction in which a package is exchanged for
money.  As the transaction seems to be completed, cut to

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

Santa Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,
above the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND
GRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes
of a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog
wagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his
apron, leaves the wagon, and runs toward the bar.

                         DOYLE

            The guy in the brown coat.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

RUSSO enter the bar on the run.  He stops and looks over the
room.

RUSSO'S POV

There are TWENTY or THIRTY MEN at the bar, at least TEN are
wearing brown coats!  The TWO MEN involved in the deal see
RUSSO and start to run.  One (THE BUYER) takes off out of
the back door.  The other (THE PUSHER) jumps over the bar
and heads for the front entrance.

                                                            3.


EXT. THE BAR - DAY

THE PUSHER dashes out past Santa Claus (DOYLE).  RUSSO
follows him and all three give chase.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

THREE FIGURES running down a New York tenement alley, the
first in flight, the others in pursuit.  We pick up the
incredible clutter of such an alley, mounts of rusting beer
cans, paper bags of garbage bulging and ripping open, old
bed springs, burned out mattresses, etc.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of BLACK PUSHER tripping on the tangle of trash
going up against the wall in his stumble, face toward the
camera, and the figures of RUSSO and DOYLE leaping upon him
from off-camera.  There is a blur or fast struggle as DOYLE
and RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.
BLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his
hand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.

                         RUSSO
            Son of a bitch!

The words are both warning and a grunt of pain.  As RUSSO
takes the blade and utters the words, we simultaneously go
to DOYLE crouching and snatching his .38 out of the right
ankle holster.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and the BLACK PUSHER, DOYLE pistol-
whipping him into submission with three lightening chops of
the gun to the PUSHER'S head.  DOYLE continues to beat the
man mercilessly into submission.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

3-shot of BLACK PUSHER sitting between DOYLE and RUSSO.
DOYLE is at the wheel.  BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his
hands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping
blood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.  All
three are breathing hard.

                         DOYLE
            What's your name, asshole?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Fuck you, Santa Claus!

DOYLE hits him across the face.

                                                            4.


                         RUSSO
            Your name is Willie Craven.

BLACK PUSHER doesn't look up.

                         DOYLE
            Who's your connection, Willie?
            What's his name?

No response.

                         RUSSO
            Who killed the old Jew in the
            laundromat?

BLACK PUSHER's brow furrows, looks up just a little.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't...

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            What?

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever pick your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't know what you're talkin'
            about.

                         DOYLE
            Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            No... yeah...

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever sit on the edge of the
            bed, take off your socks and stick
            your fingers between your toes?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Man, I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You made three sales to your
            roaches back there.  We had to
            chase you through all this shit and
            you tell me you're clean?

                                                            5.


                         RUSSO
            Who stuck up the laundromat?

                         DOYLE
            How about that time you were
            picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for
relief from the pressure of the inquisition.

                         RUSSO
                   (in pain)
            You better give me the guy who got
            the old Jew or you better give me
            something or you're just a memory
            in this town.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            That's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do
            nothin'.

The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion
and fear.

                         DOYLE
            You put a shiv in my partner.  Know
            what that means?  All winter I
            gotta listen to him gripe about his
            bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust
            your ass for those three bags -
            then I'm gonna nail you for pickin'
            your feet in Poughkeepsie.

EXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP
AND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT

DOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of
the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The
sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained
bandage on the left forearm.

                         DOYLE
            Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb
            guinea.

                         RUSSO
            How'd I know he had a knife.

                         DOYLE
            Never trust a nigger.

                         RUSSO
            He coulda been white.

                                                            6.


                         DOYLE
            Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?

                         RUSSO
            Not a chance.

RUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical
rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a
business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is
part of the inventory.

                         DOYLE
            Let's popeye around the Chez for a
            half hour, catch the end of the
            show and a couple drinks.

                         RUSSO
            Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.

DOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat
for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause,
sticks one in RUSSO's mouth.

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you
            say?

                         RUSSO
            Drink this.

                         DOYLE
            Whip it out.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

THE TITLES COMMENCE

                    THE FRENCH CONNECTION

Titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits
and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We
zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to
occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes
immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives
their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks
RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE
turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair
opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is
concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and
the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort
of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,
why they are there.

                                                            7.


INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick
certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems
too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and
CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's
attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that
emanate from the same large table.

                         DOYLE
            I make at least two junk connections
            at that table in the corner.  The
            guy is the stripe combo, I know him
            too.

                         RUSSO
            Hey, I thought we come for a drink.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close
foreground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.

                         DOYLE
            Who is that guy?

                         RUSSO
            Policy man in Queens.

                         DOYLE
            What about the last of the big-time
            spenders.  You make him?

RUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from
DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL
BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,
the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars
of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture
of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their
hair coiffed towers.

                         RUSSO
            No, you?

                         DOYLE
            Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He
            spreads it like the Russians are in
            Jersey.

                         RUSSO
            He probably sells insurance.  Owns
            a chicken farm in Hackensack.

                                                            8.


Zoom in slowly on SAL as he deals tips and orders.  Through
DOYLE's eyes, we go from Guest to Guest at SAL's table,
taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and
laugh, lost in the show chatter.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE finishing his drink, still looking at the table.

                         DOYLE
            Dig who's just come over.  The
            creep on the end.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

The camera pans down the table to dig the "creep on the end."

                         RUSSO (VO)
            Jewish Lucky from the Bronx... He
            don't look the same without a
            number across his chest.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE close in right profile, SAL's table in the far blurred
background.

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you say we wait and give him
            a tail?

                         RUSSO
            Give who a tail?

                         DOYLE
            The greaser with the blonde.

                         RUSSO
            What for -- you wanna play Hide the
            Salami with his old lady?

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- just for fun --

INT/EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

The view from the back seat of DOYLE's car.  DOYLE is at the
wheel, RUSSO packed uncomfortably into the corner at DOYLE's
right.  Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the
street the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is
parked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender
talking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for
a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips,
crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.

                                                            9.


One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going
through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing
the name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance
of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette
business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting
through the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his
pocket.

                         DOYLE
            Monica?  Who's Monica?

                         RUSSO
                   (handing him a cigarette)
            A and A, that's all you're
            interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

As soon as DOYLE has finished lighting the cigarette SAL and
his PARTY come bubbling out of the Club noisily, a little
drunkenly.  SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.

DOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand
on the ignition key.  He does not turn it.  He is waiting
for the cover of noise from the starting of SAL's car.
RUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend,
his head back, arms across his chest.

                         DOYLE
            Cloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us
            to Little Italy.

DOYLE reaches under his seat for the straw surveillance
hat - throws it up to read ledge of car.

                         RUSSO
            I'm telling you, Popeye, he owns a
            bagel mine in the Bronx.

A long view of the Club entrance.  SAL and ANGIE, a well-
built "classy" blonde with good legs, get into their black
Mercury sedan.  The Mercury takes off towards First Avenue.
We hear DOYLE's car start and we move off after them on the
last blink of tail-lights at the corner.

EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

Cabs, Daily News and Times delivery trucks, bakery vans and
a few cruising cabs, one or two passenger cars and a coasting
green and black police cruiser -- this is the 4:30 a.m.
traffic through which DOYLE moves.

A rear-window view of SAL and ANGIE BOCA, in animated
conversation.  His head is turned toward her, his hand
raised in a gesture.  ANGIE is sitting in a corner with her
back to the door, in profile to the back window.

                                                           10.


Her blonde head bobbles with laughter over some remark SAL
has made.

the sparse traffic.

panning to pick up the Italian names on the candy stores,
funeral parlors, bars, grocery stores, social clubs.

A long view of SAL's car from the DOYLE-RUSSO auto, over the
shoulders of the two cops.  DOYLE is leaning on the wheel of
his car.  He's against the curb about 100 yards behind SAL.

Medium close view of SAL in the middle of Mott Street,
walking quickly toward the opposite side of the street,
hands in the pocket of his white raincoat.  He glances over
his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car.

Close of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor
has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This
district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York.

Close rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level
of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at
that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights,
can be seen in the background walking around the cars,
across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway.

Medium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the
doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes
something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into
the doorway.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close from the front of DOYLE and RUSSO low against the
dashboard.

                         DOYLE
            It's a drop!

DOYLE's face, close, light smile.

                                                           11.


Long view of SAL walking down the sidewalk quickly for about
a quarter of a block while the headlights of his car, with
ANGIE apparently driving, move up with him.  At another
doorway, he looks back and then steps inside.

it up, and starting to walk toward a line of parked cars.

Close shot from rear seat of DOYLE and RUSSO glancing at
each other.

SAL and ANGIE stop in the street beside beat-up white Dodge.
Without a word they get in.  Hold as they get in, SAL starts
and they begin to drive out of the spot.

Close on DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            It's startin' to cook, Cloudy, my
            man is cookin'...

A series of impressionist traveling shots of the white Dodge

the rear-view mirror while BUDDY is turned around on the
seat, looking out the rear window.

A long shot, from the DOYLE-RUSSO viewpoint of the candy
store.  The door is open, the street is deserted.  Lights
are going on in the little shop.

                                                           12.


Hold on the storefront as SAL appears, this time in a candy
store operator's smock over a white undershirt, baggy slacks.
He's carrying a stack of newspapers.  Zoom in on SAL stacking
the Sunday Times and the Daily News on the rack in front of
the store as ANGIE appears in the doorway.  She's blackhaired
now, the blonde wig gone, also wearing a grey cotton smock
over a plain skirt and sweater, holding a cup of coffee.  We
hold on them for a beat, then

                                            CUT TO:

DOYLE and RUSSO close just looking at each other.  The look
says everything about the freak case they have stumbled into.

EXT. QUAY MARSEILLE SHIPYARD

                         CHARNIER
            Quelle importance.  Ce qui compte
            pour moi c'est d'avoir un chantier
            qui puisse recevoir les plus grands
            bateaux du monde.

                         MARCEL

            foutu depuis que je suis descendu
            de ces cabines.

            Lay off with that wop stuff, will
            you?

EXT. WEINSTOCK'S APT. BUILDING - DAY

In the East 80's.  SAL exits.

                         DOYLE
            That's the third time he come here
            this week.  You got anything on the
            building?

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            The building's clean.  I checked
            the tenant list -- Don Ameche, the
            actor lives there -- oh, and
            somebody else.  Do the name Joel
            Weinstock ring a bell?

TIME LAPSE

Late day.  WEINSTOCK leaving building, nodding to doorman.

                         DOYLE
            You're kiddin'

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            No sir -- this is where Joel lives.

                         DOYLE
            He was the bank on that shipment
            outta Mexico three years ago.

                                                           21.


                         RUSSO
            So I've heard.

EXT. CANDY STORE - NIGHT

SAL and ANGIE leaving.

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you know -- he's takin' his
            wife out for a change.

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

INT. LEATHER FACTORY - DAY

Across street from Candy Store.  DOYLE and RUSSO at the
printing machine.

                         DOYLE
                   (at leather printing machine)
            Got a job for me when this is over,
            Mrs. Levene?

They have a view of the Candy Store across street.  Various
people go in and out.  Next to DOYLE, at a stamping machine,
is MRS. LEVENE, the factory owner.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What are you fellows looking for?
            What do you want from that nice
            candy store?

                         DOYLE
            We have reason to believe it's a
            front for the biggest counterfeiting
            operation in the country.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What?

                         DOYLE
            That's right.  They're trying to
            steal the formula for Hershey
            bars --

DOYLE continues his work at the print-out machine, while
observing the candy store.

We see SAL leaving the store.  He crosses to his car, near
the RUSSO car.  As he passes it, he sees RUSSO locked in
embrace with a lady in a babushka.  As SAL drives off, we
get a closer look at the "LADY" in the babushka: DETECTIVE
JAMES DOYLE.

                                                           22.


INT. RUSSO'S CAR ON TRIBORO BRIDGE CROSSING TO WARD'S ISLAND

                         DOYLE
            What the hell am I drivin' for?
            I'm a first grade Detective.
            You're a second grade guinea.

                         RUSSO
            I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.

SAL up ahead in the Mercury.

                         DOYLE
                   (at the wheel)
            What?

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND - BRIDGE

The Mercury crossing the bridge to the Island.

                         RUSSO
            He's goin' to Ward's Island.  We'll
            get spotted.  What the hell's he
            goin' there?

DOYLE-RUSSO car B.G.

                         DOYLE
            Maybe he's goin' to see his brother.

                         DOYLE
            Or could be another drop.  I guess
            he gets a free ride.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

A Brooklyn slum street on a morning in November.  It is
about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet.  A scattering of
tenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life.  There
are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all
appearing to be closed.  We look down the street and pick up
DOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.  They
are heading toward the bar.  A young man is coming out -
they grab him and throw him back.

INT. BAR ROOM - DAY

The Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO.
There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the
joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of
dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy
with conversation, laughter and music.

                                                           23.


DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to
the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at
his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt,
under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting
to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the
bar.

DOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of
the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.

                         DOYLE
            Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here!

Twenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle-
taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move
until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of
the customers doesn't.

                         DOYLE
            What's my name?

                         1ST MAN
            Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         1ST MAN
            Mr. Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         1ST MAN
            What?

DOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The
MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to
DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of
them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,
running the length of it.

Close of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming
the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the
magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking
at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the
customers.

Close shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking
into it.

Close shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one
of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on
the bar.

                                                           24.


Then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of
heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He
empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail
mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled
with tomato juice.

DOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours
the mixture into the ashcan.

                         DOYLE
            Milk shake anyone?

He wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to
step forward.  The MEN do not move at first.

                         DOYLE
            Move ass when I tell you.

They move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO
BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN.

                         DOYLE
            Put it on the bar.

Hands of the THREE MEN going into pockets.

Close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto
the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana
cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates.

                         DOYLE
                   (collecting the works)
            All right, you three clowns step
            into those phone booths, you're
            goin' in.  Go on.  Stand in there
            till I'm ready for you.

The three men turn and enter the individual phone booths.
They stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 Question.

                         DOYLE
            Everybody goes when the whistle
            blows.

RUSSO is with another man from whom he's just taken a set of
works.

                         RUSSO
            What's your story?

                         DANCER
            Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in
            show business.

                                                           25.


                         RUSSO
            You're in show business.

                         DANCER
            S'right.

                         DOYLE
            What do you do in show business?

                         DANCER
            I'm a dancer.

                         RUSSO
            All right, get up on that bar and
            dance.

                         DANCER
            What?

                         RUSSO
            Get up on the bar and show me how
            you work.  If I like it you don't
            have to go in.

                         DANCER
            You're for real?

                         JERRY LEON
            Hey man, why don't you let the
            fella alone.

                         RUSSO
                   (a shout)
            Am I talkin' to you -

                         JERRY LEON
            No, but I'm talkin' to you.

                         RUSSO
            I'm tellin' you to shut up and
            stand over there.

                         RUSSO
                   (to Dancer)
            Get up there.

The man climbs up on the bar.

                         DANCER
            I got no music!

                         RUSSO
            Fake it.

                                                           26.


The man goes into a fast tap dance.  But he only gets in a
few steps --

                         DOYLE
            All right, that's enough, you're
            under arrest.

RUSSO pulls the man off the bar, sends him into one of the
phone booths.

DOYLE coming down the front of the bar.  He stops before
another man, who has just come out of the toilet.

                         DOYLE
            What about you?  Can you stand a
            toss?

                         2ND MAN
            I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You don't use shit?

                         2ND MAN
            No.
                   (he goes for his wallet)


                         DOYLE
            Did I say you could move that
            hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?

                         2ND MAN
            No - no.

                         DOYLE
            Cause if I do.

DOYLE frisks the man.  Comes up with vial of pills and two
roaches.

                         DOYLE
            Wise guy, huh?  Let's see what else
            you got.
                   (to RUSSO)
            - Buddy!

He collars the man and shoves him towards the toilet.

RUSSO, eyes moving everywhere, hand on the gun.

                                                           27.


                         RUSSO
            If I see any shit on the floor,
            it's yours, so keep your eye on
            your neighbor.

Inside the toilet of the bar.  The MAN is up against the
wall.  DOYLE is only inches away.

The MAN is an AGENT and this is the only way DOYLE can get
immediate information from him without destroying the man's
cover.  Their conversation is in whispers.  And very fast.

                         DOYLE
            How's everything?

                         2ND MAN
            Everything is everything.

                         DOYLE
            How come there's nothing out there?
            That stuff is all milk.

                         2ND MAN
            There's nothing around.  Nobody's
            holding.

                         DOYLE
            I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.

                         2ND MAN
            Boca?

                         DOYLE
            B.O.C.A.

                         2ND MAN
            Doesn't register.

                         DOYLE
            Got a wife named Angie.

                         2ND MAN
            No, nothing.  There's only some talk.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         2ND MAN
            Coming in this week, week after.
            Everybody going to get well.

                         DOYLE
            Who brings it?

                                                           28.


                         2ND MAN
            Who knows?

                         DOYLE
            Where do you want it?

                         2ND MAN
            This side.

Door of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming
behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled
prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man
to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway
down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another
one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides
that would be futile too.

                         DOYLE
            I'm goin' check on this address in
            the Bronx, if you're bullshitting
            me, it's your ass.

                         RUSSO
            Tell everybody we'll be back in an
            hour.

                         DOYLE
                   (to all)
            We're goin' now!  Goodbye.

EXT. PASSENGER SHIP - DAY

Close shot of DEVEREAUX, New York harbor in the background,
being interviewed by television reporters on his arrival in
the U.S. abroad a passenger ship.  He is smiling, jovial,
charming.

                         REPORTER 1
            How long will you be here?

                         DEVEREAUX
            Not long enough.  Two... perhaps
            three... weeks at most.

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX and THREE TV REPORTERS, as
they talk, a crane moves into action behind them and lifts
out of hold.  LA VALLE is with DEVEREAUX as Translator and
Interpreter.

                         GIRL TV REPORTER
            Why did you come by ship, Mr.
            Devereaux?

                                                           29.


                         DEVEREAUX
            The next several weeks will be very
            difficult and the middle of the
            ocean is the only place where the
            telephone isn't ringing all the time.

                         REPORTER
            What will be the viewpoint of your
            documentary.

                         DEVEREAUX
            To make a Frenchman feel what it is
            like to be a New Yorker.

                         LA VALLE
            That's enough now, ladies and
            gentlemen.  M. Devereaux is due at
            his hotel in half an hour.

Overhead the Lincoln comes down from the hold of the ship.

EXT. WEST SIDE DRIVE - DAY

A long view of the pier from the opposite (east) side of
West Street, beneath the steel trusses and girders of the
West Side Drive and through the forest of cars that are
parked there, the jam of traffic that develops around every
unloading vessel.  It is a view that takes in the front end
of the Lincoln inching off the pier.  HENRI DEVEREAUX at the
wheel, turns to his right.  We watch until the point of view
on the sidewalk.  ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI are
standing there watching.  When the car (off-camera) turns
east on the way to the garage, NICOLI glances to CHARNIER.
CHARNIER does not look back.

EXT. DORAL HOTEL - LINCOLN PULLS IN - DAY

INT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT

Close shot of WALTER SIMONSON at desk in the large square
office he occupies as a Lieutenant of Detectives in charge
of the Manhattan Narcotics Bureau.  He is the immediate
superior of RUSSO and DOYLE, head of the 200-man narcotics
squad that polices Manhattan.

                         SIMONSON
                   (with coffee cup)
            All that is great -- but you guys
            work Bed-Stuy.  You're not supposed
            to be in Ridgewood.

DOYLE, RUSSO and SIMONSON

                                                           30.


                         DOYLE
            Detach us.  Let us have a shot at
            it, at least until we see if
            there's anything here or not.
            Everybody wants Weinstock, right?
            So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve
            it.

                         SIMONSON
            You couldn't burn a three-time
            loser with what you're bringing in
            here.  You know you stiffs could
            run yourselves an entrapment rap.
            The guy has done nothing -- Brooklyn
            is full of Candy Store guys with
            two cars who like to go to
            nightclubs.

                         RUSSO
            Put this little candy hustler
            together with Joel Weinstock and it
            could be we stumbled into a big
            score.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves to window)
            Big score!  He's dealin' a few bags
            here and there on the side.

                         DOYLE
            Simonson, I wouldn't be infringing
            on your coffee break if I thought
            he was a nickel and dimer.

                         SIMONSON
            Your hunches have backfired before,
            Doyle.

DOYLE, close, no comment.

Back to SIMONSON.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves back to stand
                   at desk)
            Jimmy, what the hell's happening
            with you lately?
                   (pause)
            You got more collars than any Narc
            in the bureau.  What was it.  Over
            100 last year?  Terrific.  But who?

                         SIMONSON (CONT'D)
            You stop and shake down a bellboy
            because he's got three joints in
            his sock.  You hit a high school
            kid in short pants who looks like
            he's got a twitch.

RUSSO.  Getting it back on the track.

                         RUSSO
                   (moves in to desk)
            We got information that there's no
            shit in the street -- it's like a
            desert full of junkies with a big
            score coming in to make everybody
            well.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            This could be it, Walter.  This
            Candy Store guy, putting on a big
            show in a fancy nightclub with
            known connections all over him.
            Then on our own, after working the
            whole day and night, we tail him
            out to Brooklyn and sit on him for
            a week practically, and who do we
            come up with?  Joel Weinstock.
                   (he leans forward)
            You gotta let us have it.

            You really believe all this crap?

                         RUSSO
            I go with my partner.

A pause.

                         SIMONSON
            What'll it take?

                         RUSSO
            First a wire.

                         DOYLE

            You know I have to get a court
            order for wiretaps.

                         RUSSO
            Try... okay?

                         DOYLE
            We know you can do it, Walter.

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD (HUNTS POINT AND EAST RIVER) - DAY

HIGH ANGLE: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE
walking slowly together toward the camera.  They are at the
auto graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off
New York streets by the Police Department.  About twenty
other men are walking around, looking at the cars.

A POLICEMAN blows a whistle and the prospective car buyers
gather around the auction trailer in the b.g.

                         LA VALLE
            There are four auto graveyards like
            this one in the other boroughs,
            handling about a thousand vehicles
            a month.  Those that aren't claimed
            are auctioned here once a month.

                         MARIE
            Just for mistakes of parking?

                                                           34.


                         LA VALLE
            No.  Many are involved in crimes
            and confiscated... or just abandoned.
            This is, as you know, your prime
            source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

                         MARIE
                   (off camera)
            Darling, may I have this one?

Medium close shot MARIE, standing next to an LTD.

                         MARIE
            It looks so lonesome here.

CHARNIER and LA VALLE approach her.

                         CHARNIER
            It would look even more lonesome in
            our garage.

INT. THE AUCTION TRAILER - DAY

Within the large trailer, about TWENTY MEN are seated at two
long benches to each side.  Some are standing to the rear.
At the front, an AUCTIONEER stands at a lectern.  To his
left sits a CLERK at a small table.  The AUCTIONEER wears a
sweater and hat.  The buyers are tough types, young and old.
All have inventory lists.  The atmosphere is informal.  The
CHARNIERS and LA VALLE enter the trailer at the back.

                         AUCTIONEER
            Every car sold today must be
            removed at the purchaser's own
            expense.  We have no keys or
            anything to start the vehicles with.
            You buy 'em as you see 'em and
            where you see 'em.  All right, the
            first car offered is Number 24398.
            A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear
            fifteen dollars?

The bidding goes up to forty dollars.  A large BURLY MAN
wins the bid.  He goes up to the CLERK and accepts the bill
of sale.

                         AUCTIONEER
            We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station
            wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars?

                         LA VALLE
                   (aside to CHARNIER)
            Notice he will never mention the
            year of the car.

                                                           35.


                         AUCTIONEER
            I got a fifteen dollar bid going...
            Do I hear anymore...
            Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen?
            Twenty...
            Twenty-three...
            Anymore...
            Twenty-five.  Twenty-five once --
            Do I hear twenty-eight...
            All right, last call for twenty-
            five...

            for shipment?

            jacket is our buyer.

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND (UNDER WEST ABUTMENT OF THE HELLGATE
BRIDGE)

Pick up CHARNIER, MARIE and MAURICE LAVALLE

As the camera plays over the bridge: (in French)

                         CHARNIER (V.O.)
            It's beautiful.

                         LA VALLE (V.O.)
            It was built in 1917 - and was one
            of the two heaviest bridges in the
            world.  The arch is still the
            largest in the world.

                         CHARNIER
            Who financed it?

                                                           37.


                         LA VALLE
            Two railroads as part of a
            connecting railway which provided
            passage from New England to the
            South.  It was actually the first
            railroad through New York City.

                         MARIE
            Why is it called Hellgate?

                         LA VALLE
            The river at this point is the most
            dangerous on the East Coast.  Years
            ago, hundreds of ships went down
            here.

                         CHARNIER
            If this bridge were in Europe, it
            would be on every tourist's sight-
            seeing list.

                         LA VALLE
            Most New Yorkers never notice it -
            most Americans have never heard of
            it.

                         CHARNIER
            Look how gracefully they conceived
            that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It
            was built from both ends.  With no
            support in the middle.  Beautiful.

                         LA VALLE
            Mmm.

                         MARIE
            Alain is the only man I know who
            can become as enthusiastic about a
            bridge as he can about a woman.

                         CHARNIER
            Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

                                                           38.


                         LA VALLE
            I'm afraid the rest of Ward's
            Island isn't nearly as romantic - a
            pollution plant, a hospital, a
            training school for garbage men and
            that area over there, where the old
            cars are kept, prior to being
            processed for shipment to, among
            other places, The Charnier Shipping
            Company, of Marseilles, France.

(NEAR CREMATORIUM)

                         MARIE
            What is that old building?

                         LA VALLE
            Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

                         MARIE
            What was it?

                         LA VALLE
            It was a crematorium.

                         MARIE
            For garbage?

                         LA VALLE
            For dead bodies.

INT. WHIP GIRL'S APT.

Close shot of NICOLI's face.  He's being whipped, and is
caught in an ecstasy of pain and pleasure.  The tempo of the
strokes rises.  Suddenly it reaches a crescendo and he
screams out in orgasm.

Close, full-length shot of a nude BLONDE GIRL, wearing only
black boots and silk panties.  She's walking away from the

whip.  We can hear NICOLI's heavy breathing until the girl
speaks as she moves toward a couch.

                                                           40.


                         WHIP GIRL
            You're Fifty Dollars short.

The look of anger turns to one of consternation as NICOLI
reacts to her.

                         WHIP GIRL
            M'sieru - the tab for this scene is
            a hundred and a half.
                   (he moves to door)
            Hey Frenchie - if you don't come up
            with the scratch, you're gonna run
            into my man downstairs.

Medium close shot of NICOLI advancing on the WHIP GIRL as
she backs away and begins to cringe.  He grabs her and hurls
her back across the couch.

                         WHIP GIRL
            Don't hit me.  Don't.  Please.

We hear the door slam as she sobs.

                         WHIP GIRL
            You filthy faggot sonofabitch.

INT. CUTTING ROOM - DAY

his narration (DIALOGUE IN FRENCH)

                         DEVEREAUX
            This is the new American religion,
            professional football.  It is where
            everybody goes instead of church on
            Sunday to express that peculiar
            American taste for bloodshed and
            violence.

Several close shots of the violent action.

Intercut with faces of the crowd.

                         DEVEREAUX
            These men, playing a "game" - make
            more money each year than many
            important business leaders, artists
            or government officials.

            It tells us something about this
            country and how its men live, or go
            to war with a smile, and sometimes
            die without a cause.

INT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - NIGHT

In Lower Manhattan.  There are SIX or EIGHT MATRONS still
there, stevedores and truck drivers.  Most of them are
clustered at the far end of the bar, where MUTCHIE, a gray-
haired gone-to-paunch Irishman with spectacles as thick as
pop-bottle bottoms stands behind the mahogany bar.  The
cluster of customers is involved in a typical New York
saloon argument.

DOYLE is ignoring the debate and watching the television.
He is approached by a small MAN in a long coat and baggy
suit with suspenders.  This is JESUS THE BOOSTER.

                         JESUS
            Hey, Bo.

                         DOYLE
            Hiya, Jesus.

                         JESUS
            Can you use a new suit for
            Christmans?

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you got?

JESUS reaches into his trousers and pulls out three suits
(jackets and pants).  They are of the latest style and
color, and still on hangers!

                         JESUS
            Whatta you?... a 44... 46?

DOYLE examines one of the jackets.

                                                           42.


                         DOYLE
            Where'd you get this fag shit?

                         JESUS
            This is what the tough guys are
            wearin'.  You know I only steal
            from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.

                         DOYLE
            Pass.

                         JESUS
            Forty dollars -- was $250.

                         DOYLE
            Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and
            burned.

JESUS blends into the crowd and we pick up the dialogue of
MUTCHIE and his cronies, BAD EDDIE, LEE and PUGGY.

                         MUTCHIE
            A big man could alluz beat a little
            man.  That's why Wilt Chamberlain
            could murder Jim Brown if they ever
            fought.

                         BAD EDDIE
            No chance.  Brown'd kill him.

                         MUTCHIE
            Chamberlain's seven foot tall,
            right?  He's got a twelve-foot
            reach.  It's geophysics.  He's
            punchin' down on you with leverage.
            He cave your chest in.

                         BAD EDDIE
            Best I ever seen was The Rock.  He
            was the calmest and the meanest.
            Guys like Sugar'd be pukin' before
            a fight.  Jake LaMotta'd be pukin'.
            Marciano was calm like he was goin'
            to church.  What about the night he
            fought LaStarza?  He hit him so
            hard he broke the blood vessels in
            LaStarza's arms.  He was the
            strongest meanest bastard ever lived.

                         PUGGY
            Hey, Mutchie, give us another bullet.

MUTCHIE pours him a straight Scotch in a shotglass.

                                                           43.


                         MUTCHIE
            Blackjack Burns coulds been the
            greatest ever --

                         PUGGY
            -- He was a stone tanker.

                         MUTCHIE
            That's right, he couldn't fight
            legit.  One night at the Garden
            about 1950, '51 -- he fought either
            Jake LaMotta or Gus Lesnevich, I
            think it was -- he took one o'
            those cream puff punches in the
            sixth -- the laziest left you ever
            seen -- missed him entirely.  Down
            goes Blackjack without even workin'
            up a sweat and the whole Garden
            gets up in its feet and I swear to
            Christ, everybody starts singin'
            "Dance With Me Henry."

                         LEE
            I fought a guy in Cleveland once.
            I knew he was a dirty fighter so I
            stick a crowbar in my crotch.
            Right here.  Second round he gives
            me a shot -- Boom -- he breaks his
            hand, the fight's over.

                         PUGGY
            Fuck it, I like nitroglycerin,
            that's my game.

                         MUTCHIE
            What about you, Doyle?  Who's the
            best fighter you ever seen?

                         DOYLE
                   (a few drinks behind him)
            Willie Mays.

                         BAD EDDIE & LEE
            Willie Mays?!

                         DOYLE
            With a baseball bat!  One swing!
            Knock your fuckin' head off.

TIME LAPSE.  The DRINKERS are gone.  MUTCHIE is at the bar
cleaning up.  DOYLE is in the open adjoining kitchen area
cooking breakfast.

                                                           44.


                         MUTCHIE
            What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin'
            from the cops?

                         DOYLE
            I hear the health department is
            going to close this joint for
            selling dirty beer.  I come by to
            help you carry out your money.

                         MUTCHIE
            They'll close you down if they ever
            get a look at those busted-valise
            broads you run with.

                         DOYLE
            You want some eggs.

                         MUTCHIE
            Why not?

                         DOYLE
                   (looking around for bacon)
            Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah!

                         DOYLE
                   (rattling pans,
                   looking around)
            Where the hell is it?

                         MUTCHIE
            Where the hell do you think it is,
            potato head?

DOYLE opens the door to the icebox.

                         MUTCHIE
            No wonder there's so many Mafia
            around.  Ya couldn't find a Puerto
            Rican in Spanish Harlem.

TIME LAPSE.  Almost morning.  Close on DOYLE and MUTCHIE
eating bacon and eggs.  MUTCHIE is standing behind the bar
as he eats, DOYLE is sitting in front of it.  They both have
a bottle of beer.

                                                           45.


                         MUTCHIE
            I got this little chick I'm tryin'
            to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I
            take her to Jilly's last night and
            she's tellin' me about how she
            wants to settle down one day, get
            married... I says, "Hey, this is
            1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old
            man lookin' to score with some
            pussy."

                         DOYLE
            Strike out, eh?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya
            look like a night's sleep wouldn't
            kill ya.

                         DOYLE
            A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.

                         MUTCHIE
            When ya go back on?

                         DOYLE
            Morning.  Sometime.

                         MUTCHIE
            Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool
            table for a couple hours.  The kid
            comes in at six will wake ya.  A
            couple eggs and a beer is cheaper
            than keepin' a dog around the joint.

EXT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - DAY

Close of DOYLE going to his car.  He stops for a light.
DOYLE is red-eyed and in need of a shave.  He fidgets
through his pockets looking for a cigarette but doesn't find
one.  As he drives along a GIRL CYCLIST comes into view
alongside.

Our view is DOYLE's view of her long, lean tapered legs.  If
he looks further, and DOYLE always looks further, he will
see there is a bra-band sweater covering her well-formed
breasts.  The pendulous swing is there as she bends over the
handlebars.

Close front view of DOYLE looking back to the light, then
back to the legs.

Close outside view, the cyclist, of DOYLE leaning out the
window with his badge in his hand.

                                                           46.


                         DOYLE
            You got a pedaller's license?

                         GIRL
            What?

                         DOYLE
            You're under arrest.

INT. SIMONSON OFFICE - DAY

Medium close shot of RUSSO and SIMONSON.  PHIL KLEIN, a
federal narcotics agent, is reading aloud from an article in
the New York Daily News.  MULDERIG is listening and sipping
coffee.

            Walter?

Medium close of SIMONSON and RUSSO

                         MULDERIG
            Christ, by the time you get out all
            this shit'll be legal.

Wide shot of room, taking in SIMONSON, RUSSO, MULDERIG and
PHIL KLEIN.  SIMONSON hands BUDDY a stack of warrants.

                         SIMONSON
                   (rises, to RUSSO)
            The judge gave you ten days on
            these.  Klein and Mulderig will be
            sitting in for the Federals.  Tell
            Doyle they'll make all the buys,
            and that they're to be kept informed
            of everything that goes down.

SIMONSON turns to MULDERIG.

                         SIMONSON
            You know Doyle, don't you Bill?

Close of MULDERIG.

                                                           47.


                         MULDERIG
                   (rises)
            Sure, I know Popeye.  The Master of
            undercover, whose brilliant idea of
            disguise is to limp into a room on
            his left foot and limp out on his
            right.  Whose brilliant hunches
            cost the death of a good officer --

Close of RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            If that's how you're coming in, why
            not stay home and save us all a lot
            of grief.

MULDERIG, close.

                         MULDERIG
            That's just my opinion.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Whyn't you shove it up your ass!

EXT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Long shot of RUSSO approaching housing project group of
buildings.  This is where DOYLE lives.

INT. HALLWAY TO DOYLE'S APARTMENT

RUSSO rings the bell.  No response.  He knocks.  Again
nothing.  He hears a shower working inside the apartment.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

No answer.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

                         DOYLE
                   (off, weakly)
            Yeah.

                         RUSSO
            It's Cloudy.  Open the door.

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            I can't.

                                                           48.


                         RUSSO
            Why not?

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            Let yourself in.

RUSSO reaches into his jacket pocket and gets a celluloid
card, his PBA card, which he slides into the door at the
lock.  He gives it a juggle and the lock is free but the
door moves grudgingly.

INT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The door to DOYLE's apartment, a close view from inside.
There's a bike propped against it and BUDDY RUSSO is trying
to push it open from the outside.

                         RUSSO
                   (behind door)
            What the hell you got holding the
            door?

The bike teeters and falls with a crash and RUSSO comes into
the room puzzled, exasperated.

INT. APARTMENT - RUSSO'S POV - DAY

DOYLE is anklecuffed to the bedpost at the foot of the bed.

                         RUSSO
            What happened to you?

                         DOYLE
                   (sleepy)
            The crazy kid handcuffed me to the
            bed.  With my own cuffs.

The shower goes off.  RUSSO puts the bike upright on its
stand and squeezes the horn, which makes a loud beep.

The BIKE GIRL appears in the bathroom door, wrapped in a
towel.

                         BIKE GIRL
            Oh!

RUSSO sees key on dresser - tosses it to DOYLE.  There are
clothes all over the place, the GIRL's cycling outfit,
DOYLE's pants and shoes and socks.  The decor is completely
impersonal.  RUSSO looks up.

                                                           49.


                         RUSSO
                   (looking at scrapbook
                   on dresser)
            You oughta get plastic covers for
            this stuff like I did - your
            scrapbook's a mess like everything
            else in your life.

RUSSO goes to chair.

                         DOYLE
            Gimme my pants.

RUSSO, who is half sitting on them, pulls the pants loose
and hands them to DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            You got the warrant?

                         RUSSO
                   (sitting)
            We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil
            Klein.

Close on DOYLE, buttoning his pants.

                         DOYLE
            What do we need those pricks for?

Medium close on RUSSO picking around through the clothes,
coming up with a pair of panties.  He holds them out.

                         RUSSO
            Because by actual count our bureau
            has exactly nine hundred eighteen
            dollars and fifty-four cents to
            make buys and Mulderig's Feds can
            get all of Uncle Sam's money he
            wants by just asking.

DOYLE sitting on bed, strapping the holster on his ankle.
He checks his gun.

                         DOYLE
            Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you?
            How good are the warrants?

                         RUSSO
                   (on the move down
                   hall, at bathroom door)
            Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

                                                           50.


DOYLE is checking various items that go in his briefcase -
notebook, handcuffs, book of laws, field reports, pencils,
binoculars, candy bars, etc.

Medium close shot of RUSSO looking toward the bathroom door.

                         RUSSO
            Hi!

RUSSO looks back to DOYLE.  There is the sound of a kickstand
being kicked back in place, the door opening and the GIRL
leaving.

Medium close shot of DOYLE tying the shoes, wincing.  Looking
up to the departing GIRL.

                         RUSSO
            Drive carefully!

EXT/INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of BILL MULDERIG in back seat.  BUDDY is in
front, next to DOYLE at the wheel.

                         MULDERIG
            Strictly small potatoes.

We can see DOYLE working to keep up with the black Mercury
as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge in fairly heavy traffic.
The Mercury cuts around in and out, DOYLE plunges after him.

                         MULDERIG
            You really know how to pick 'em,
            Doyle.

RUSSO turns his head in anger.

                         MULDERIG
            Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            Somebody told me the reason you did
            that was so's when you met a chick
            and rubbed against her she wouldn't
            know you were a cop.

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            I said that was bullshit.  It must
            be some kind of fast-draw gimmick
            or something.

                                                           51.


                         RUSSO
            Knock it off, Bill.

                         MULDERIG
            He's gettin' too far ahead.  You're
            gonna lose him.

DOYLE cuts into the next lane to a lot of horn-blowing and
comes to a dead, screeching stop.  DOYLE sits up sharply
erect in the seat, craning to see where SAL is going.  He
throws open the door and hurls himself out.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Rear medium close shot of DOYLE climbing up on the side of
the car to look ahead, then jumping down and running off.

DOYLE running as hard as he can.

Medium close side shot of SAL turning off the bridge onto
the FDR Drive, moving quickly and smoothly uptown.

DOYLE running to a stop, and staring ahead.  Breathing hard,
horns are blowing on the bridge and they drown out the words
as he curses, "Dirty Sonofabitch."

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

RUSSO is on the blower.

                         RUSSO
            Phil -- it's Cloudy -- we lost
            him --

Static comes over the two-way radio.

EXT. BOCA'S CAR COMES OFF RAMP, PAN TO

INT. KLEIN'S CAR - DAY

KLEIN is parked on Pearl Street below the Brooklyn Bridge.

                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            He just got off the Bridge - He's
            all yours if you can find him.
            Sonofabitch!

KLEIN starts his car.

EXT. A PARKING GARAGE IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL emerges from the garage and heads toward Madison Avenue.
He passes a man looking in a store window, PHIL KLEIN.
KLEIN follows him.

                                                           52.


EXT. A STREET IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL stops abruptly at the corner and turns around.  KLEIN is
forced to pass him and cross the street.

SAL crosses the street to his left, at a right angle to KLEIN.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - LATE DAY

SAL moving north on Madison Avenue.  He is walking in a
triangular trap of foot surveillance.  We begin to learn
this when we fall back twenty feet behind SAL and pick up
the figure of JIMMY DOYLE, moving at exactly the same pace.
While he keeps looking forward after SAL, he also looks
regularly to the left, across to the West side of Madison
where we quickly zoom in on the figure of BILL MULDERIG, who
is on an even line opposite SAL and moving almost precisely
in step with the subject of their surveillance.  MULDERIG
keeps an eye on SAL but is also glancing north ahead of SAL
to BUDDY RUSSO, who is 20 or 30 feet ahead of SAL, thus
forming the triangle of the A-B-C tail.

SAL bobbing along.

DOYLE following.

MULDERIG keeping pace.

RUSSO up front.

SAL suddenly turning East at the Northeast corner of 46th
Street, the block occupied by the Roosevelt Hotel.

INT. ROOSEVELT LOBBY - DAY

Roosevelt lobby stairs with ALAIN CHARNIER, PIERRE NICOLI,
SAL greeting.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me.

                                                           53.


                         RUSSO
                   (he is moving through
                   the jam they form on
                   the stairs)
            Excuse me.

We move into the lobby of the Roosevelt and then spin around
quickly, to watch CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL moving upstairs
and out the door.

EXT. DAY

A distant view from the Northeast corner of 46th Street and
Madison Avenue of the Roosevelt Hotel marquee and the three
men under it, CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL.  They are in animated
conversation.

DOYLE and MULDERIG on the point-of-view corner across
Madison, MULDERIG with his back to the camera, DOYLE talking
and watching over Mulderig's shoulder.

Close shot DOYLE's face, eyes bright with excitement.

Long view of CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL under the marquee from
DOYLE's view, zooming in on CHARNIER, who continues to talk,
look up, then look back to SAL.

                         DOYLE
            You take Sal.  I'll stick with the
            beard if they split.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Rear view of ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI strolling
slowly down Madison Avenue in the Forties.

with him.

CHARNIER and NICOLI window-shopping at Walter's Electric,
49th and 3rd Avenue.

RUSSO looking quizzically, puzzled, from a doorway.

CHARNIER and NICOLI are engaged in a running conversation
that we cannot hear.  But what CHARNIER is saying is simply
that he wants to get a pack of cigarettes before they turn
back and stop for dinner.

RUSSO looking to DOYLE for a signal.

                                                           54.


EXT. A CIGAR STORE - DAY

DOYLE already beginning to feel the cold, rubbing his hands
together, at the front of the place CHARNIER and NICOLI have
entered, trying to figure it out as CHARNIER and NICOLI
emerge, CHARNIER ripping the cellophane off a pack of
cigarettes, and they turn back in DOYLE's direction.

DOYLE, face to face with CHARNIER and NICOLI.  Straining to
hear, he picks up a few words of French.  Without losing
stride he steps off the curb and cuts across the street,
moving south, away from them, as they come north.  But
halfway across the street, we pick up RUSSO coming in his
direction, sharp enough to pick up the tail where DOYLE had
to drop it.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close view through window of ALAIN CHARNIER and
PIERRE NICOLI sitting at a table near the front windows of a
small restaurant.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A long shot of street zooming in on JIMMY DOYLE who is

the other, his shoulders hunched, occasionally cupping his
hands to his ears.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

A medium close shot of WAITER holding a bottle of Sainte
Emillion out for CHARNIER's inspection.  CHARNIER looks,

DOYLE's feet.  He's standing on one foot, the other raised
and he's squeezing it with a chapped hand, as if trying to
get circulation back into it.

Medium close shot of RUSSO standing in front of DOYLE while
DOYLE fishes a piece of pizza out of the bag and lets it
fold into his mouth, then licks his fingers.

                         RUSSO
            You want the red or the white?

                         DOYLE
            Pour it in your ear.

glancing toward CHARNIER and then the tray.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Close shot of RUSSO peering at the restaurant.  DOYLE's face
right behind him, peering over RUSSO's shoulder, trying to
drink coffee from a paper container and also moving slightly
against the cold and the pain of the shoes.

EXT. FIRST AVENUE - DAY (EXT. COPAIN)

Rear long view of CHARNIER and NICOLI on Madison in the
Forties strolling to a corner where NICOLI is splitting for
the Edison Hotel (West 46th Street) while CHARNIER goes on
to the Westbury on upper Madison.  They part with a wave and
a nod.  Hold on them as BUDDY RUSSO comes into view, moving
off after NICOLI.  DOYLE follow CHARNIER.

half-turned to keep an eye on the elevators.

                         DOYLE
            That guy just walked in.  What's
            his name?

Close on CLERK and DOYLE.

                         DESK CLERK
            I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.

                         DOYLE
                   (showing badge)
            He got off on six.

                         DESK CLERK
            We have four rooms and six suites
            on six.  There's a man in almost
            every one of them.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Little shorter than me.  Well-
            dressed.  About forty-five or fifty
            with salt-and-pepper hair, a beard.

Close of CLERK.  Thinks it over.

                         DESK CLERK
            There's nobody like that on six.

DOYLE AND CLERK

                         DESK CLERK
            Perhaps he's visiting a guest.

                         DOYLE
            No, I figure he stays here.  Where's
            your registration?

CLERK gets out registration log book, goes through list as
DOYLE waits.

                         DESK CLERK
            There may be two... no, three who
            could fit it.

                         DOYLE
            Names.

            A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here
            alone.

                         DOYLE
            Where from?

                         DESK CLERK
            Des Moines.

                         DOYLE
            What's he do?

                         DESK CLERK
            Businessman.  Owns a department
            store in Des Moines, I think.

DOYLE is taking down the information on a pad.

                         DESK CLERK
            Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would
            be another.  He's in shipping.

                         DOYLE
            Yeh?  Who else?

                         DESK CLERK
            And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I
            don't know what he does.

                         DOYLE
            This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?

                         DESK CLERK
            I think so.  But they're in Room
            408.  On the fourth floor.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Yeah, I know.

EXT. WESTBURY HOTEL ON MADISON AVENUE - NIGHT

Medium close shot of DOYLE standing in another doorway, this
one in Madison Avenue, opposite and a little up the street
from the Westbury.  It is about 2 o'clock in the morning and
there's not much traffic.  DOYLE looks like a man almost too
tired to stand.  We hear a car pull up (off camera).

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - NIGHT

View from the front seat of a sedan of DOYLE falling into
the corner of the back seat.  RUSSO reaches across the seat
from the camera to hand DOYLE a brown paper container of
coffee.  He opens it between his knees and scalds his mouth
with it.  RUSSO hands over another gift, a pint of Canadian
Club.  DOYLE takes a big swig.

Rear close view of BILL MULDERIG at the wheel of the car,
looking at DOYLE in the rear-view mirror.

                         MULDERIG
            You about ready for a break?

A view of MULDERIG at the wheel, RUSSO twisted around in the
seat, looking back at DOYLE and putting the cap back on the
bottle.  When DOYLE isn't sipping at the coffee-whiskey,
he's looking out the window of the car at the entrance of
the hotel.  He looks beat.

                         DOYLE
            The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure.
            Also he made me.  Stayin' on four
            but went up to six -- cute.

                         RUSSO
            The other guy's a frog too.  Checked
            in at the Edison.  Had a hooker
            sent up.

                         MULDERIG
            Christ you should o' collared him
            right there.

                         DOYLE
            Who's on him?

                         RUSSO
            Phil Klein.

                                                           59.

            What about Sal?

RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            We put him to bed for the night.

MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
            You look like shit.

DOYLE AND MULDERIG - INTERCUT

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Look.  My partner and I found this
            case and I don't want no Feds
            screwing it up.

                         MULDERIG
            Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn
            thing.

                         DOYLE
            Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off
            and I'll knock you into the middle
            of next week.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Jimmy, cool it.  Nothin's goin'
            down tonight.  Cop a few zzz's
            while you can.

Close shot, DOYLE.

INT. WEINSTOCK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Close shot of CHEMIST with a small lab layout spread in
front of him -- burner, test tubes, etc.  The MAN's wearing
an ordinary business suit and both the table and the
background indicate that this is not a lab, but somebody's
library or den -- and a fashionable one, with photos, a
signed picture of Lyndon Johnson, etc., on the panelled walls.

The CHEMIST is running a Thiele test on a small mound of
powder.  Heroin from CHARNIER's shipment.

Medium close shot of JOEL WEINSTOCK and SAL BOCA sitting
opposite the CHEMIST.

                                                           60.


SAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy
snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are
interested; SAL quite nervously.

The CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the
size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin.

He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister
test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny
alcohol lamp.

He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case,
fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the
heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.

He places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open
rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the
burnmeister tube, about three inches in.

With a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp.

We watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the
white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the
mineral oil and

The mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220° - 230°.

The faces of the three men are filled with wonder and
anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a
cheering section, rooting the hometeam home.

The longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer
the heroin.  The mercury stops at 240°!

                         CHEMIST
            Absolutely dynamite!  89.5 proof!
            Best I've ever seen!  If the rest
            is like this, you'll be dealing for
            two years on this load.

Close on WEINSTOCK, relaxed, smoking a large cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Retail is not my end of the business.
            Are you telling me it's worth the
            half million?

Medium close of the CHEMIST.

                         CHEMIST
            How many kilos?

                         SAL

                         CHEMIST
            Six kilos at eight big ones a
            kilo...
                   (he nods)
            I'd say it should be able to take a
            seven to one hit in the street.

                         SAL
            By the time it gets down to nickel
            bags it's at least thirty-two
            million!

Medium close of WEINSTOCK and BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Thank you, Howard.  Take what's
            left there with you and goodnight.

The CHEMIST packs his apparatus and leaves.

                         SAL
            I guess we got a deal, eh?

Medium close shot of WEINSTOCK alone, appraising BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            We got a test.  A deal for half a
            million dollars, maybe.

SAL, whose cool is easily shattered.

                         SAL
            Joel, the man is in a hurry.  He
            wants the bread and he wants to go
            back to France.  He ain't gonna
            hang around and play games.  He's
            one o' the shrewdest cats I ever
            run across.

WEINSTOCK, close.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What am I, a shmuck?  What's the
            hurry?  He could see a couple of
            shows and visit the top of the
            Empire State Building.

INTERCUT SAL, WEINSTOCK

                         SAL
            Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot
            o' time settin' this one up.

                                                           62.


                         WEINSTOCK
            So whatta you want a badge?  It's
            your first major league game Sal.
            One thing I learned, move calmly,
            move cautiously.  You'll never be
            sorry.

                         SAL
            I been damn careful up to now.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Which is why your phone lines are
            tapped and the Feds are crawlin'
            all over you like flies.

                         SAL
            I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't
            got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin'
            you, he'll take the deal somewhere
            else.

WEINSTOCK

                         WEINSTOCK
            He could go someplace else with his
            sixty kilos of heroin and see how
            easy it is to pull together a half
            million cash.  He wouldn't find
            there was any hurry to do this kind
            of business.

SAL, a little desperate.

                         SAL
            Look, the stuff is here.  We could
            set up the switch in an hour.  I'm
            tellin' you, Mr. Weinstock, he'll
            split if we don't move.  This guy
            is everything they say he is.

WEINSTOCK taking SAL apart with his eyes over the cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What about you, Sal?  Are you
            everything they say you are?

Close of SAL's worried face.

young Black HOOKER leaning against a lamppost, smiling at a
passing PEDESTRIAN.  Hold on her as the car moves on,

            No.

                         DOYLE
            Then how come you're leaning on it.

Close shot of HOOKER.

                         DOYLE
            I ever bust you?

            I never seen you before.

DOYLE and the HOOKER.

            Get your ass in the car.

DOYLE looking right and left, the form of the GIRL climbing
into the vehicle.  He puts surveillance hat on back seat.

INT. DAN'S LUNCH - DAY

DOYLE is standing at an island counter in a coffee-doughnuts
joint.  The COUNTERMAN is paying no attention to him but is
instead emptying coffee from a large dispenser into a pot.

                         DOYLE
            You gonna wait on me or am I gonna
            sit here all day?

The COUNTERMAN responds quickly to DOYLE's voice.

jelly squeezing out onto his fingers.

                                                           64.


A kid pushes a broom past, getting rid of a collection of
cigarette butts, etc.

                         DOYLE
            Hey!

Close shot of KID, about 16, looking up from the broom
toward DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
                   (off camera)
            C'mere... C'mere!

Medium close shot of DOYLE and the KID, DOYLE eating and
drinking.

                         DOYLE
            Can you stand a toss, Hector?

                         KID
            What you mean?

                         DOYLE
            You still dealin' shit?

                         KID
            Jesus, no, Doyle.  I'm clean.  I'm
            working twelve hours a day here.

Close shot of DOYLE talking around a mouthful of doughnut.

                         DOYLE
            When they going to make you chairman
            of the board?

Medium close shot of DOYLE and the KID.  DOYLE puts down the
coffee cup.  Waves the KID closer.  The KID moves closer,
DOYLE frisks him quickly, expertly, then rips up the kid's
jacket and takes a 12-inch toadsticker out of the kid's
waistband.

Close shot of DOYLE looking at the knife, snapping the
button and watching the blade flash out.

                         DOYLE
            You clean your fingernails with this.

Close shot of KID.

                         KID
            Rather be caught with it than
            without it.

DOYLE, pushing button and letting the blade fall into closed
position.

                         DOYLE
            Yeah, I guess so.

DOYLE hands the knife back to the kid.  HECTOR goes back to
work.  DOYLE eats.

EXT. DAN'S LUNCH - DAY

DOYLE climbing back into his car, knees on the seat, reaching
over into the back.

Close shot over the rear seat of DOYLE picking up the straw
hat, which has been jammed into the corner by the contours
of the Hooker's tail.  He straightens it as much as possible
and throws it under the driver's seat.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Medium shot of DOYLE on foot popeyeing up Madison Avenue in
the vicinity of the Westbury.  As unobtrusively as possible,
he's looking for the tail that should be there covering
CHARNIER.  DOYLE is on the East side of the street, and the
Westbury is on the West.  He pokes his head into a couple of
doorways, checks the cars parked at the curb, looks up to a
couple of the mezzanine shops along the street.  He sees
PHIL KLEIN and ANOTHER AGENT talking together totally
oblivious to the front entrance.  MULDERIG in a cigar store
looks to his wristwatch, then goes inside the store.

Close shot of DOYLE frowning, puzzled.  There doesn't seem
to be anybody alert.  He looks over to the hotel.

Westbury Hotel entrance from DOYLE's Point of View.  CHARNIER
steps out of hotel entrance, turns south.  The two AGENTS
and MULDERIG have not seen his exit.

Close on DOYLE in a doorway.

CHARNIER, carrying an umbrella, strolling blithely down the
street, in DOYLE's direction but on the opposite side of the
street.  Zoom in on his face, reflecting no concern, no
problems, then zoom back to DOYLE's position.  Pan to the
hotel entrance as DOYLE looks for somebody else.  Where the
hell is CHARNIER's surveillance?

Very quickly, DOYLE's nervous glances.

CHARNIER close.

A long view of the street.

                                                           66.


CHARNIER moving along.

The hotel entrance.

Close shot of DOYLE going through the glancing movements,
his eyes showing CHARNIER getting farther and farther down
Madison Avenue.  But there's still nobody following him.

moving down the street after CHARNIER.

subway entrance stairs.  Hold on the empty stairs.  Then
DOYLE's painful, scuffed shoes, follow.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

Close shot CHARNIER standing on the subway platform, looking
at the Times, glancing toward the tracks and the rumble of a
train in the distance.

Side rear view of CHARNIER close in the foreground, DOYLE
moving into view in the background, not looking toward
CHARNIER, keeping his face turned mostly away from the
Frenchman.

the train pulls in.  CHARNIER is folding up his paper to
board.  DOYLE is moving toward the train.

the wall.

DOYLE close, barking into the phone.

                         DOYLE
            I'm sittin' on Frog One.

MULDERIG in phone booth at Westbury.

                         MULDERIG
            Yeah, we got the Westbury covered
            like a tent.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him
            down at the subway at Times Square.
            What the hell's goin' on?  I make
            him coming right out of the hotel
            free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.

Close shot of CHARNIER strolling past the telephone booth,
DOYLE looking down.

                         DOYLE
            I don't care how many bartenders
            are sick.  I don't work in that
            joint.  What the hell kind of a
            union are you running down there?

Long view of CHARNIER and DOYLE about thirty feet apart on
the platform, a second train approaching.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN

A close view of DOYLE just inside the doors of the car
sneaking a peek at the platform.  We can see that CHARNIER
is not there.  He's on the train.  Suddenly CHARNIER
reappears on the platform.  DOYLE steps off.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

Long view from DOYLE's vantage point of CHARNIER standing
with his back to the train, looking up like a man who can't
make up his mind, then turning to his left, away from DOYLE
and getting back on the train.

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Close view of subway doors hissing shut and an umbrella
being raised at the last moment by an off-camera hand
(CHARNIER's).  The doors jerk open in the safety spasm.
There is a blur of the a fabric moving across the camera,
blocking the view of the doors.  It is only a moment.  When
it clears, the doors are closed again, the umbrella is gone.
But we don't know what happened and the train isn't moving.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DOYLE'S CAR

Rear close view of DOYLE peeking into the forward car to see
where CHARNIER is sitting.

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Quick, shocked close view of that car, revealing that
CHARNIER isn't there among the twenty passengers dozing or
moping in their seats.  There is a blurred flash as if
DOYLE's own eyes are spinning frantically back to the
windows of his own car.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

Medium shot of DOYLE jumping out of train, CHARNIER jumping
back on - train takes off.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

DOYLE.  He gives him a little wave.

A view from CHARNIER's position of DOYLE chasing the train,
anger and hatred and frustration storming across his face.

EXT. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY - MOSHOLU EXIT

A long view from the bottom of the steep embankments above
Harlem River Drive in Washington Heights.  Sprayed along the
face of the cliff is a disaster -- an overturned city bus
and a car with which it apparently collided.  The scene is
lighted with flares.  Police rescue WORKERS and FIREMEN are
scrambling up and down the face of the cliff.  They are
carrying BODIES out of the bus and the car, COPS pulling
them out through the windows, leading them on stretchers.
There are shouted orders and some moans and cries from the
wreckage.  In the foreground is LT. WALTER SIMONSON, involved
in the operation, but also involved in a hassle with DOYLE,
MULDERIG and RUSSO who are standing with him.  An officer
approaches SIMONSON with a set of heroin works.

                                                           69.


                         OFFICER
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This belonged to the kid who was
            drivin' the sports car.  17 years
            old.  His girlfriend OD'd in the
            car.  We found this set of works in
            her arm.

Medium close shot of DOYLE and SIMONSON.  DOYLE couldn't
care if Rome was burning on the hill; he's only interested
in his case.

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Where the hell was the surveillance?
            "Go to bed." That's all you could
            say.  You couldn't keep track of a
            bleeding elephant in a snowbank.

SIMONSON, eyes on the hill, glancing to DOYLE with irritation.

                         SIMONSON
            Jimmy, it doesn't matter anymore.
            If there was a deal it must have
            gone down by now.  We blew it!  We
            blew our cover and we blew the
            warrants --

                         MULDERIG
            Charnier and his wife checked out
            of the Westbury.  Nicoli checked
            out of the Edison --

                         RUSSO
            This fella Nicoli's got a record in
            France, Walter.  He's wanted for
            questioning in the murder of a
            French cop.

                         DOYLE
            I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

                         MULDERIG
            That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in
            the subway and you blew our cover.
            If they haven't moved already
            they're not gonna move now.

                         DOYLE
            Walter, I can make this case if the
            Feds will get the hell out of my way.

                                                           70.


                         MULDERIG
            With pleasure -- it's all yours.
            Walter, if anything develops outta
            this charade give me a call.

Medium shot of SIMONSON, DOYLE, MULDERIG and RUSSO.  Lights
flashing around them; stretchers going by with bodies.

                         RUSSO
                   (to MULDERIG)
            My ass.  The only reason you're in
            this is because you've got a big
            expense account for buying junk and
            you like to see your picture in the
            papers.

                         DOYLE
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This is my case.  Get these guys
            off my back and let me handle it.

SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
            For chrissake, will you come off
            that "my case" bullshit.  This has
            been a whore's dream from the start.

DOYLE, close.

                         DOYLE
            The deal hasn't gone down yet
            Walter -- I know it, I can feel it.

Close shot of MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            The last time you were dead certain
            we ended up with a dead cop.

A fist, DOYLE's, comes from off-camera and connects with
MULDERIG's chin.  As his head flies back.

DOYLE and MULDERIG slugging and grappling with each other,
RUSSO leaping in to yank them apart.  SIMONSON grabbing
MULDERIG's arm and holding him back.

SIMONSON, close.

                         SIMONSON
                   (roaring)
            That's enough.  Get the hell out of
            here.

                                                           71.

            Jimmy, you wasted two months - no
            collars are comin' in while you two

EXT. DEPT. OF COMMERCE, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

CHARNIER and an UNDERSECRETARY on the steps of the building,
shaking hands.  Two other OFFICIALS are on hand and while we
don't hear their conversation, their manner is extremely
attentive to CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            It has been highly informative and
            a personal pleasure to see you again.

                         UNDERSECRETARY
            I only hope we cut through to some
            meaningful proposals in the next
            month or so.  The pleasure was
            mine, Mr. Charnier.  When will we
            see you again?

                         CHARNIER
            Soon, probably in the Spring.

                                                           72.

                         CHARNIER

            Goodbye.  Good trip home.

his problems to CHARNIER.

                         SAL
            Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I
            will need a few more days though,
            the boys think we oughta cool it
            for awhile -- make sure there's no
            heat.

                         CHARNIER
                   (manner outwardly pleasant)
            You must take me for an imbecile.
            Why do you think I asked you to
            meet me in Washington?  I haven't
            spent five minutes in New York City
            without the company of a gendarme.

                         SAL
            Look, I'll level with you -- I need
            a little more time -- I got to
            shift gears.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you having trouble raising the
            half million?

                         SAL
            Hell no -- my end is covered -- my
            associates just feel we ought to
            wait for a more opportune time to
            make the switch.

Stop, Cover.

                                                           73.


                         CHARNIER
            It has to be by the end of this week.

                         SAL
            Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be
            reasonable.

                         CHARNIER
            It's your problem.

                         SAL
            It's yours too!

Full length shot of CHARNIER and BOCA, CHARNIER leaning over
to shake his hand.

                         CHARNIER
            So nice to have seen you again.

CHARNIER turns and walks off, leaving SAL looking after him
as we zoom back to a Point of View about a hundred yards
down the street.

Close of PHIL KLEIN, just watching.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Close shot of MRS. CHARNIER, sitting by the window of two
seats on the shuttle, looking out and babbling at CHARNIER.
(DIALOGUE IN FRENCH).

                         MARIE
            Look, darling, they sell these at
            the Smithsonian.

She extracts a necklace and bracelet of shark's teeth from
an elegant alligator bag.

Camera moves back to take in CHARNIER looking from the Wall
Street Journal to the native craft bracelets.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you sure it is dead?

                         MARIE
            I'm going to put them on the cat.

                         CHARNIER
            That's a relief.

Close shot of CHARNIER, tenderly, lovingly.

                                                           74.


                         CHARNIER
            You did find something for yourself,
            of course.

MARIE, close.

                         MARIE
            Of course.  But I am not going to
            tell you what it is until we are
            back in Marseilles.

CHARNIER and MARIE.  He folds up the paper, smiling at her.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me a moment, darling.

CHARNIER's view of the plane interior, walking back toward
the rear of the cabin.  The seats are occupied by military-
business-government TYPES making the shuttle run.  Not every
seat is filled.  We come to an empty one on which someone
has deposited an attache case.  It is the seat next to
PIERRE NICOLI, whose hand reaches out to remove it and we
follow the arm to NICOLI's face.

Close shot of CHARNIER and NICOLI sitting. (DIALOGUE IN
FRENCH)

                         CHARNIER
            I'm afraid they've become a bit...
            over-cautious.  Our American friends.

                         NICOLI
            What happens to the schedule?

                         CHARNIER
            We must follow it.

                         NICOLI
            But will they?

CHARNIER shrugs.

                         CHARNIER
            I don't know.  Boca is scared.
            He's not strong enough.  He sees
            policemen in his soup.

                         NICOLI
            He is not wrong.

                         CHARNIER
            Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed
            me on the subway, he's the eager one.

                                                           75.


                         NICOLI
            Let me take him out.

Close of CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            There'll be someone else.

                         NICOLI
            What difference does it make?
            We'll be out of the country Friday.

Close shot of CHARNIER alone.

EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE DOYLE'S APARTMENT BLDG. - DAY

A complex of buildings similar to Lefrak City.  A medium
close view of a LITTLE GIRL about to run DOYLE down with a
two-wheel bicycle.  Two shots ring out in quick succession
and tear up the concrete at a point where he would have been
walking a moment earlier.

DOYLE diving for the cover of a tree.  The rifle goes off a
third time and MOTHERS begin to scream on the benches of the
playground area.

                         DOYLE
                   (yelling)
            Everybody, down!  Get down on the
            ground!

DOYLE behind the tree, pulling his gun out of the ankle
holster.  He holds the gun ready and tries to look around.
Ping, another shot that drives him back.

Long panning view, DOYLE's view, from the ground, of all the
rooftops in the area.  A blank.  The background sound is
still screaming crying. "Call the police." "The man's got a
gun." "Help!  Help!" The view is still slow, careful under
the pressure of the panic.  There's another shot.

Long shot of rifle smoke rising from NICOLI's sniper position.

Exterior view of the concrete tunnels, DOYLE running from
them toward the building, dodging and ducking behind
playground equipment and benches as he does.  He's shouting
as he runs.

                         DOYLE
            Get down!  It's a sniper.  Get down!

Medium shot of DOYLE dashing into the lobby of his building
to a Spanish kid in the window of building.

below, grabs rifle and cartridge.

DOYLE running to the parapet, looking over.

Shot of the street, traffic, elevated tracks in the distance.
Long searching look of the streets and the people.  The
view, which is DOYLE's, passes over one man in a dark suit,
stops and goes back.  Zap!  It's NICOLI walking quickly but
not in any panic toward the El.

DOYLE's face.  He runs to parapet, fires at NICOLI.  Misses.

DOYLE running across the roof and through the door.

DOYLE bursting out of the elevator at the bottom, through a
crowd of WOMEN and KIDS who scream as they did in the
playground.

Medium close view of DOYLE running as fast as he can.

right in front of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Stop that guy.  He's wanted by the
            police!

Side medium close shot of DOYLE turning and plunging back
through the doorway of platform exit.

INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

In one corner of the train is a transit policeman.  He's
observed Doyle shouting and gesturing at NICOLI who sits
nervously aware of the policeman's presence.  Long longs
between them.  Finally, the officer decides to approach
NICOLI.

NICOLI panics and runs.  The officer goes after him and
traps him against the door between cars.

INT. TOKEN BOOTH - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE with badge at token booth.

                         DOYLE

            the city?

                         TOKEN ATTENDANT
                   (glancing out in
                   direction the train

            Police!

Medium close shot of DOYLE dragging MIDDLE-AGED MALE DRIVER
out from behind the wheel as he shouts.

                         DRIVER
            What the hell?

                         DOYLE
                   (diving behind the wheel)
            Police!  Emergency!

            Blind sonofabitch!

            next station!

                         MOTORMAN
            I got to stop.

                         NICOLI
            Touch the brake and I'll blow you
            in half.

                         MOTORMAN
            The signal lights are automatic.
            If I go through a red I'll be
            automatically braked.

The MOTORMAN pales, his hand goes to his left side in a
gesture of anxiety, possibly pain.

                                                           79.

stopping.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Medium close shot of CROWD on train pushing toward the
MOTORMAN's cab.  They are upset over the missed stop.  The
CONDUCTOR seems to be the most annoyed.

He's pushing hardest toward the camera to complain.

                         VOICES
            Didn't stop.
            Went right through there...
            Hey, man, that's my station...
            Where the hell's he going?
            Hey, stop the car...

Close shot of NICOLI's back, half in the MOTORMAN's cab, as
he faces the CROWD.  Now the cries turn to:

                         VOICES
            He's got a gun...
            The motorman's gone crazy...
            Oh my God!

                         NICOLI
            Get back.

                         CONDUCTOR
            Hey, you can't...

Side view of NICOLI, the MOTORMAN in the background the
CONDUCTOR leaping at NICOLI.  NICOLI burns him; one gut shot.

MOTORMAN throws back his head in fright, and the beginning
of a coronary.

lights flashing by in a reeling montage of movement, the
train roaring above it all.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Close side shot of NICOLI turning to cover the MOTORMAN, who
is clutching in pain, slumping toward the controls.

            I can't breathe.

NICOLI glances quickly to his left, out the window to the
next station.

Long, low view of the tracks, partially NICOLI's view.
There are red blinkers on the side of the tracks.  Red
lights up ahead.  That's the back of another train.  It has
stopped and we're hurtling toward it.

Wide shot of screaming pack of subway riders, fighting their
way back from NICOLI, succeeding only in turning themselves
into a tightly contained mob.  Now the words they cry are:

                         VOICES
            We'll crash.
            Won't somebody please help me.
            Murder
            He's a killer.

            Timezit?

                         RUSSO
            Four.

EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car to the street.  We
can see the Lincoln.  The lights of a car appear on the left
and come down the street past the Lincoln, slowly, like a
man looking for a place to park.  We can make out, but just
barely with the help of the street lights, four people in
the car.

DOYLE in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner
of the Lincoln in the background.  While we are looking in
silence, there is a glimmering flow in the far corner, the
beginning of approaching headlights again.  They grown
brighter and DOYLE's foreground profile turns to watch it
come.

                         DOYLE
                   (softly)
            Same car.

                         RUSSO
            Third time around.

RUSSO and MULDERIG straightening up, leaning close to window
to peer out.

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car of the approaching
vehicle, which suddenly switches off its lights and turns on
its parking blinkers.  It comes abreast of the Lincoln and
stops.  The men get out and chase the Lincoln.

View through windshield at the four men.  DOYLE is now up
straight and at the wheel.  He's leaning forward, his hand
on the key of the car.  He glances back to MULDERIG.

                         DOYLE
                   (to car radio)
            Let's him 'em.

View of the hood.  All hell breaks loose, headlights,
including DOYLE's flash on and form a spotlight on the
Lincoln and the figures around it.  Frozen in the headlights,
confused, startled, and disbelieving are FIVE PUERTO RICANS
with a variety of auto-stripping tools in their hands: lug
wrenches, tire irons, pinch bars, monkey wrenches, etc.
DOYLE drives right up to them.  The camera leaps out of the
car with him and runs toward the men.  We hear voices
shouting.

                         VOICES
            Police!  Don't move... get you...
            hands up... you're under arrest...

                                                           85.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Close view of DOYLE holding his gun on one of the terrorized-
looking Puerto Ricans.  The KID's hands are rising
tentatively.  He's too scared to move.

                         DOYLE
            Up!  Up, you sonofabitch!

In the background, the scene is being duplicated by two or
three others.

Overhead view of this headlight and flashlight arena of
about 10 or 12 DETECTIVES forming small clusters, throwing
these guys up against cars, pulling their arms around behind
them and throwing cuffs on them while others rapidly frisk
them for weapons, taking away one pistol, a couple of knives.

MULDERIG and DOYLE looking at their MAN up against the
Lincoln as RUSSO finishes snapping handcuffs on him.

                         DOYLE
            Of all the goddam cars they had to
            pick to steal hubcaps.

Close shot of the front end of the Lincoln, upended on a
hoist attached to a police tow truck.  The area is less
brightly lighted by headlights now.  Some cars have departed
with the Puerto Rican AUTO STRIPPERS.  DOYLE's interest
focuses on the car.  We pick him up as we pan to him sitting
on the running board of the tow truck, talking with its
DRIVER, who is making a report on a clipboard.  MULDERIG and
RUSSO are standing nearby, talking to TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

                         DOYLE
                   (looking up and around)
            A bunch of lousy little spic car
            thieves.

                         MULDERIG
            Nothing in there except a New York
            street map.

                         DOYLE
            Tumble it.  One end to the other.

RUSSO jotting in his note pad, then glancing up to the off-
camera DOYLE.

DOYLE, medium close, hands jamming into his pockets, staring
at the ground with RUSSO and MULDERIG.

                                                           86.


INT. POLICE GARAGE - DAY

A montage as the Lincoln is being disassembled.  First it is
weighed.  We then see the MECHANIC drain the gas, pull apart
the transmission and check through the brake drums, rip out
the seats.

MECHANIC ducking out from under the car, moving toward off-
camera DOYLE.

                         MECHANIC
            Nobody's been under there with
            anything but a grease gun since if
            came off the line.

DOYLE's hand reaches out from off-camera and takes a
cigarette package out of the MECHANIC's pocket.

                         DOYLE
            I don't buy it.  The stuff is on
            this car.

                         MECHANIC
            Then you find it.  I can't.

INT. POLICE SERGEANT'S OFFICE AT GARAGE - DAY

Shot of DEVEREAUX and LA VALLE.

                         LA VALLE
            The car was lost sometime this
            evening.  First they send us to
            Pier One -- then they send us
            here --

                         DESK SERGEANT
            I don't understand why you had it
            parked on the waterfront.  You're
            staying at the Doral and you lose
            your car somewhere out by the
            Brooklyn Bridge.

                         LA VALLE
            In point of fact, M. Devereaux is
            scouting locations for a film for
            French Television.  He left the car
            to look at some point of interest.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving, excitable)
            We were told by the Police
            Commissioner's office that the car
            was brought to this garage.  I
            demand its immediate return.

                                                           87.


                         DESK SERGEANT
            If you'll be patient, Mr. Devereaux.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving)
            I have been patient enough.  There
            is no reason I should have to waste
            time with this red tape.

                         LA VALLE
            Mr. Devereaux is an extremely
            important guest of this country.
            He is working with the absolute
            cooperation and participation of
            your government.  Here are his
            credentials from the French
            Consulate.
                   (showing them)
            Unless you wish to see this episode
            portrayed in his film I suggest you
            locate his car immediately.

Shot of DOYLE and RUSSO near the Lincoln, now up on hoists.
Police MECHANIC in background.

                         MECHANIC
            What are you looking for?  Is it as
            big as an orange or an elephant's
            ass?  I've been over every inch --
            top to bottom.  If you could give
            me a club -- to the size...

                         RUSSO
                   (doing rough figures
                   on a piece of scratch paper)
            What was the weight of the car when
            you got it, Irv?

                         MECHANIC
                   (consulting his notes)
            4,839 pounds.

                         RUSSO
                   (consulting Lincoln
                   Specification Book)
            You're sure?
                   (he does quick addition)
            The manufacturer's spec says it
            should weigh 4,719 pounds.  This
            one's carrying roughly 120 extra
            pounds somewhere.

He produces a copy of a ship's manifold.

                                                           88.


                         RUSSO
            When it was booked in at Marseilles
            it weighed the same.  120 pounds
            overweight.  Jimmy has to be right.

The THREE MEN turn again to stare at the Lincoln.  The
MECHANIC lowers the hoist, thoughtfully.

                         MECHANIC
            I ripped everything out except the
            Rocker panels.

                         DEVEREAUX
            What's that?

They look at each other for a long moment.

MECHANIC starts to undo the side Rocker pans.  JIMMY pulls
the pan off and sticks his arm into the enclosure.  Feeling
around inside he pulls out the first kilo-sized plastic
container as several others start tumbling out after.  BUDDY
and DOYLE are smiling at each other as they continue to pull
the bags out.  Several of the other MECHANICS in the garage
are gathered around the happy moment.  They repeat this
action on the other side of the car.

RUSSO enters garage sergeant's bullpen.  DEVEREAUX and LA
VALLE are still arguing with the SERGEANT.

                         RUSSO
            Got it for you, Randy -- it just
            came in from downtown.  Who's
            Devereaux?

                         LA VALLE
            This is M. Devereaux.

                         RUSSO
            I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we
            get reports on a couple hundred
            vehicles a night.  Sometimes it's a
            little tough to keep track.

                         DEVEREAUX
            You mean the car's here now?

                         RUSSO
            Yeah -- fine -- it's okay -- not
            even a scratch.  You're all set.
                   (handing DEVEREAUX keys)


RUSSO walking with DEVEREAUX and LA VALLE.

                                                           89.


                         RUSSO
            Someone stole it right off the
            street, huh?  You're gonna have to
            pay the tow away charge.

                         DEVEREAUX
            I was told these things happen in
            New York -- but one never expects it.

                         RUSSO
            Yeah.  Well, it's in perfect shape.
            You must lead a charming life.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DORAL - DAY

toward the camera. (DIALOGUE IN FRENCH)

                         CHARNIER
            Henri...

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX turning to face CHARNIER, who
has been waiting for him.

                         CHARNIER
            Did you pick up the car?

                         DEVEREAUX
            It is waiting for you in the garage.

                         CHARNIER
            Did they follow you?

                         DEVEREAUX
            I wasn't looking.

                         CHARNIER
            Henri... I need one more favor from
            you.  I know I am imposing...

                         DEVEREAUX
            My friend, I am not sure about what
            is going on -- but for me, I am
            finished.

                         CHARNIER
            Not quite -- you are in it whether
            you like it or not.  The police
            know you brought the car into the
            country.  This makes you an
            accomplice.

                                                           90.


                         DEVEREAUX
            An accomplice to what?!  What have
            you gotten me into, Alain?  You
            asked me to do you a favor -- and I
            did what you asked -- but you've
            taken advantage of me.  I have my
            reputation --

CHARNIER pulls DEVEREAUX further aside.

                         CHARNIER
            Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust
            me -- this is an extremely
            complicated situation to which
            there is a simple solution if you
            do exactly what I tell you.  It's
            worth more money to you.

                         DEVEREAUX
            Goodbye.

DEVEREAUX turns and walks into the crowded lobby leaving
ALAIN standing alone.

EXT. HOTEL STREET - DAY

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Medium close shot of the Lincoln.  The Rocker panels are
open and the junk is being unloaded.  CHARNIER is standing
by two suitcases of cash.  He takes a bundle out of the
suitcase, riffs the deck of bills with his fingers to make
sure it's money all the way through; puts it in a separate
stack that will go into the rocker panels of a nearby junk
car.  WEINSTOCK is standing next to the CHEMIST, with his
testing equipment.  The MECHANICS are under the Lincoln and
passing out the kilos of heroin, BOCA is helping them.  The
kilos are concealed in the floor boards of the old garage.

                         DOYLE
            The sonofabitch is in here somewhere.
            I saw him -- I'm gonna get him.

DOYLE exits down the corridor.  The others staring after him.

EXT. CREMATORIUM

Within the building no one is visible.  Overhead, the
Hellgate Bridge, sounds of New York, jets, auto traffic, and
an approaching Penn Central train.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

	A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
	surround it.

	CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

	The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
	WORLD OF LIQUOR.

	TITLE CARD:

				BIG SPRING, TEXAS
			   109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
			345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

	A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
	a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
	in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
	mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

	It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
	off duty for the day.

	The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


	INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
	stool behind the counter.

	A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

	A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

				MCGRAW
		Hot goddamn day!

				PETE
		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

				MCGRAW
		Not even for lunch?

				PETE
		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

				MCGRAW
		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

				PETE
		Whatsamatter?

				MCGRAW
			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

				PETE
		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

				MCGRAW
		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

				PETE
		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

				MCGRAW
		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

				PETE
		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

				MCGRAW
		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

				MCGRAW
		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

				PETE
		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

				PETE
		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

				SETH
		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

				PETE
		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

				SETH
		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

				SETH
		Were you giving that pig signals?

				PETE
		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

				SETH
		He says you were scratching.

				PETE
		I wasn't scratching!

				SETH
		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

				PETE
		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

				RICHARD
		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

				PETE
		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

				SETH
		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

				MCGRAW
		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

				PETE
		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

				RICHARD
			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

				PETE
			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

				PETE
		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

				SETH
		What the fuck is wrong with you --

				RICHARD
		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

				SETH
		Start the car.

				RICHARD
		You believe me don't cha?

				SETH
		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


				SETH
			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
		I told you that bastard said, "Help
		us!"

				PETE
			(yelling)
		I never said help us!

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Well that don't matter now, 'cause
		you got about two fuckin' seconds
		to live! Richie!

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		Yeah?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		When I count three, shoot out the
		bottles behind him!

				RICHARD
		Gotcha!

				SETH
		One... Two... Three.


	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.



	EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
	flames.

				SETH
		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

				RICHARD
		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

				SETH
		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

				RICHARD
		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
	starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
	hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

				SETH
		Low profile. Do you know what the
		words "low profile" mean?

	CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

	The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
	the street, and speeds off down the road.

	We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
	behind it, as the store burns out of control.

	OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

	Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY

	The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
	OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
	trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
	prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
	boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

	The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
	and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
	on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

	AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

	The rest of the titles play over black as the song
	continues.

	CREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS

								  CUT TO:

	EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
	290.

	SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':

		   FORT STOCKTON
		238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER


	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

				JACOB
		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

				SCOTT
		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

				SCOTT AND KATE
		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

				JACOB
		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

				SCOTT
		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

				KATE
		-- you got your microwave --

				SCOTT
		-- you got your sink --

				KATE
		-- you got your shower --

				SCOTT
		-- see this, television!

				KATE
		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

				JACOB
		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

				SCOTT
			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

				KATE
			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

				JACOB
		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

				KATE
		Ain't it the truth.

				SCOTT
		Why do you want to stop?

				JACOB
		I'm exhausted.

				SCOTT
		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

				JACOB
		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

				KATE
		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

				SCOTT
		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

				KATE
		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

				JACOB
		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

				KATE
		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

				JACOB
		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

				KATE
			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

				JACOB
		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

				KATE
		That happens, you'll get it back.

				JACOB
		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

				KATE
		What do you think Mom would say?

				JACOB
		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE UP: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it. RING.


	INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A
	standard issue Texas motel. Richard sits outside in the car.
	Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five
	times.

				TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)
		Hold your horses!

	An OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter.
	He's eating a BBQ rib.

				OLD-TIMER
			(rough)
		Whatcha want?

				SETH
		Whatcha think I want, ya mean old
		bastard? I wanna room.


	EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

	Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
	radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
	walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
	and drives them to their room.

				RICHARD
		Do they have cable?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have an X-rated channel?

				SETH
		No.

				RICHARD
		Do they have a waterbed?

				SETH
		They don't have anything except four
		walls and a roof, and that's all we
		need.

	Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
	trunk close to the door.

	The two brothers get out of the car.

				SETH
			(tossing Richie the motel keys)
		Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

	Richie opens the door.

	Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
	empty.

	CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

	TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

	SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
		up in the trunk.

	She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
	scared and looks an absolute mess.

				SETH
		Don't say a word.

	The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
	the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
	trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
	see any, slams the door.


	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY

	Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

				SETH
		You. Plant yourself in that chair.

	She sits down in the chair.

				HOSTAGE
		What are you planning on doing with --

				SETH
		-- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
		talk. You wanna get on my good side?
		Just sit still and don't make a peep.

	She shuts up.

	Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
	wound.

				SETH
		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

				SETH
		How's it feel?

				RICHARD
		How ya think, it hurts like a
		son-of-a-bitch.

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

				SETH
		I got both rooms on either side of us,
		so we don't gotta worry about
		eavesdropping assholes. How's that
		feel? You okay?

				RICHARD
		Feels good.

				SETH
		I'm gonna go get the money.

	He heads for the door.


	EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY

	Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
	the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.


	INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY

	Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
	the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping
	stations. Seth looks at his watch.

				SETH
		It's about five o'clock.
			(to hostage)
		What time does it get dark around
		here?

				HOSTAGE
		About seven.

				SETH
		Good. I'm going towards the border to
		check things out while it's still
		daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
		rendezvous.

				RICHARD
		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

				SETH
		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

				RICHARD
		Did you even to try to negotiate?

				SETH
		These guys ain't spic fire cracker
		salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's
		scripture. So it is written, so shall
		it be done. You want sanctuary, you
		pay the price, and the price is thirty
		percent.

				RICHARD
		All I'm saying --

				SETH
		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

				SETH
		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

				HOSTAGE
		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

				SETH
		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good. Then let me explain the house
		rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about
		rule number one?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

				SETH
		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

				SETH
		Open your eyes.

	She does.

				SETH
		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my
		word. Okay?

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I'll be back in a bit.

	He exits.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


				RICHARD
		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

				RICHARD
		Come on.

	She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
	next to him.


	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the
	middle of a conversation with the party on the other end.

				SETH
		Things are real hot here. Crossing's
		gonna be a bitch.
			(pause)
		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border
		as possible? Texas wants our balls.
		The quicker we're in your protection,
		the better I'll feel.
			(pause)
		Okay, where?
			(pause)
		The Titty Twister?
			(he laughs)
		I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
		see you and your men at the "Titty
		Twister" tomorrow morning.
			(pause)
		Bye, my friend.

	Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his
	Zippo lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving
	the frame empty, a subtitle appears:

	INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows,
	watching TV, taking on hits from a water bong in the
	shape of a wizard.

	ON TV

	A local newscaster named KELLY HOUGE is reporting a story
	about the brothers.

				KELLY HOUGE
			(talking to camera)
		This bloody crime spree started just a

		Having served eight years of his

		was brought to Wichita Municipal court
		house for his first parole hearing. It
		was while at the court house that this
		man...

	MUG SHOT OF RICHARD GECKO

				KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
		... his younger brother Richard Gecko,

	VIDEO INTERVIEW

	Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

				STANLEY CHASE
		For the time being we are very
		confident we will apprehend the
		fugitives in the next forty-eight
		hours. The Bureau, local law
		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

				STANLEY CHASE
		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

				STANLEY CHASE
		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

				KELLY HOUGE
		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

				STANLEY CHASE
		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

				STANLEY CHASE
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

								  CUT TO:

	RICHARD SMILES.

				RICHARD
			(Newscaster's voice)
		Is it safe to assume since the law
		enforcement authorities in the great
		state of Texas are homosexuals of a
		sick and deviate nature, that they
		will be too busy fucking each other
		up the ass to actually catch The
		Gecko Brothers?
			(in an FBI voice)
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

	He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
	Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

				CASPER
		Would you play with me?

	A big burly COP turns around.

				COP
		Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

	The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

	Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
	take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

				RICHARD
		Shit, I started to get worried. Where
		the fuck ya been?

				SETH
		Sight seein'.

				RICHARD
		What'd ya see?

				SETH
		Cops.

				RICHARD
		Didya look at the border?

	Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
	and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
	the TV

				SETH
		Yeah, I saw the border. Through
		binoculars from on top of a high
		building. That's about as close as I
		risked getting. What's the TV say?

				RICHARD
		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		I gotta figure a way to get across
		that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
		around El Paso our lives ain't worth
		a shit.

				RICHARD
		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

				SETH
		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

				RICHARD
		How do you know?

				SETH
		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
		our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
		is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
		rendezvous on the other side, then
		Carlos and his boys will escort us to
		El Ray and --

	Seth stops talking and looks around.

				SETH
		Where's the woman?

				RICHARD
		What?

	Seth's out of his chair.

				SETH
		What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
		woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
		is she, Richard!?

				RICHARD
		She's in the other room.

				SETH
		What the fuck is she doin' there?!

	He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

				RICHARD
		Seth, before you open the door, let
		me explain what happened.

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

	Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
	room with the dead body.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

				RICHARD
		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
		just explain what happened.

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

				SETH
		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
		explanation. What's the matter with
		you?

				RICHARD
			(low and calm)
		There's nothing wrong with me,
		brother. That woman tried to escape
		and I did what I had to do.

				SETH
		No.
			(pause)
		That woman wouldn't of said shit if
		she had a mouthful.

				RICHARD
		Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
		wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
		became a whole different person.

				SETH
			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

				RICHARD
		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

				SETH
		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

				RICHARD
		Seth, if you were me --

				SETH
		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

				RICHARD
		Yes.

				SETH
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

				RICHARD
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

				SETH
			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

				KATE
		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

				KATE
		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

				JACOB
		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

				KATE
		It's a flop house.

				JACOB
		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

				KATE
		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

				JACOB
		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

				KATE
		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
	THUD... THUD...

				KATE
		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

				JACOB
		Watch where you're going!

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

				SCOTT
		What's this guy's problem?

				JACOB
		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

	HONK!

				JACOB
		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

				KATE
		Creepy guy.

	SETH

	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

				JACOB
		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

				RICHARD
		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

				JACOB
			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

				JACOB
		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

				SETH
		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

				RICHARD
		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

				RICHARD
		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

				JACOB
		Jacob.

				SETH
		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

				RICHARD
		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

				SETH
			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

				JACOB
		He's my son.

				SETH
		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

				JACOB
		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

				SETH
		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

				JACOB
		What's this about, money?

				SETH
		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

				SETH
			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

				KATE
		What's going on?

				RICHARD
		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

				JACOB
			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

				SETH
		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

				JACOB
		On the dresser.

				SETH
		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

	CLOSE-UP KATE
		
	She smiles at him.

				KATE
		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
		
				RICHARD
		Sure.


				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

				SETH
		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

				SETH
			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

				SETH
		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		Do you believe me?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

				JACOB
		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

				SETH
		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

				JACOB
		Not a chance.

				SETH
		Come again?

				JACOB
		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

				SETH
		Sorry, I need everybody.

				JACOB
		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

				SETH
			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

				SETH
		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

				SETH
		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

				SETH
		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
	the Lone Star night.


	INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

	Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
	and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

				KATE
		Excuse me.

	Richard zeros in on her.

				RICHARD
		What?

				KATE
		Where are you taking us?

				RICHARD
		Mexico.

				KATE
		What's in Mexico?

				RICHARD
		Mexicans.

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
	wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
	seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
	calmly.

				SETH
			(reading his driver's license)
		Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
		ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
		course it is.
			(motioning behind him)
		What are their names?

				JACOB
		Scott and Kate.

	Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

				SETH
		Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
		Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

				SETH
		Who's this?

				JACOB
		My wife.

				SETH
		Where is the little lady?

				JACOB
		In heaven.

				SETH
		She's dead?

				JACOB
		Yes, she is.

				SETH
		How'd she die?

				JACOB
		Auto wreck.

				SETH
		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

				JACOB
		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

				SETH
		Died instantly?

				JACOB
		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

				SETH
		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

				JACOB
		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

				SETH
		Is this real?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

				JACOB
		Real McCoy.

				SETH
		You're a preacher?

				JACOB
		I was a minister.

				SETH
		Was? As in not anymore?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Why'd ya quit?

				JACOB
		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

				SETH
		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

				JACOB
		How do I know you'll keep your word?

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

				JACOB
		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

				SETH
		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Didn't like it, did ya?

				JACOB
		No, I didn't.

				SETH
		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

				JACOB
		You won't let him touch her?

				SETH
		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

				SETH
		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

				SETH
			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

				JACOB
		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

				SETH
		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

				KATE
		Yeah.

				SETH
		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

				KATE
		Yeah, we got a bible.

				SETH
		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

				SETH
		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

				SETH
		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

				JACOB
		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

				SETH
		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

				SETH
		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

				RICHARD
		Did ya mean what you said back there?

	Kate turns to him.

				KATE
		What?

				RICHARD
		In the room. Were you serious, or were
		you just foolin' around? I'm just
		bringing it up, 'cause if you really
		want me to do that for you, I will.

				KATE
		Do what?

				RICHARD
			(in a whisper)
		What you said to me in the room.

				KATE
			(whispers back)
		What did I say?

				RICHARD
			(whisper)
		You asked me if I would --

				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		What?

	Seth and Jacob.

				SETH
		I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say
		talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say
		to one another. So cut the chatter.

	Richard turns to Kate.

				RICHARD
			(quiet)
		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

				SETH
		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

				SETH
		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

				JACOB
		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

				SETH
		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

				JACOB
		I don't have the slightest idea.

				SETH
		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

				SCOTT
		What are you gonna do?

				JACOB
		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

				SCOTT
		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

				RICHARD
		This isn't gonna work.

				SETH
		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

				RICHARD
		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

				SETH
		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

				RICHARD
			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

				SETH
			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

				RICHARD
		What does that mean?

				SETH
			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

				RICHARD
		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

				SETH
		No, I didn't.

				RICHARD
		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

				SETH
		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

				RICHARD
		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

				SETH
			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

				RICHARD
			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

				SETH
			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

				RICHARD
			(quiet back)
		Or what?

	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		

				JACOB
		Have you forgotten about your sister?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

				JACOB
		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

				JACOB
		What about Kate?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

				JACOB
		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

				SCOTT
		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

				JACOB
		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

				SCOTT
		He's running the show.

				JACOB
		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

				BORDER GUARD
		How many with you?

				JACOB
		Just my son and I.

				BORDER GUARD
		What is your purpose in Mexico?

				JACOB
		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

				RICHARD
		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

				SETH
		This ain't the time.

				RICHARD
		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		What was that?

				JACOB
		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		You said it was just you and your son.

				JACOB
		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

				BORDER GUARD
		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

	CLOSE-UP KATE

	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

				KATE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

				KATE
		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

				KATE
		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

				BORDER GUARD
		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

								  CUT TO:

	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

				SCOTT
		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

				SETH
		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

				SETH
			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

				SETH
		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

				SETH
		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

				JACOB
		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

				SETH
		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

				KATE
			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

				SETH
		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

				JACOB
		Then?

				SETH
		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

				SETH (O.S.)
		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

				SETH
		You okay?

				RICHARD
			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

				SETH
		I don't know, you just passed out.

				RICHARD
		I did?

				SETH
		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

				RICHARD
		Really?

				SETH
		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

				RICHARD
		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

				SETH
		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

				RICHARD
		We are?

				SETH
		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

				RICHARD
		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

				SETH
		They broke when you fell.

				RICHARD
		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

				SETH
		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

				RICHARD
		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

				SETH
		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

				SETH
		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

				JACOB
		Guys! We're here.

								  CUT TO:

	A neon sign that flashes:

		THE TITTY TWISTER
		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
	TWISTER DANCERS."

	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

				CHET
		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

				SETH
			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

				SETH
		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

				JACOB
		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

				SETH
		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

				RICHARD
		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

				SETH
			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

				RICHARD
		That's what you think?

				SETH
		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

				RICHARD
		I'm lookin' scared?

				SETH
		That's what you look like.

				RICHARD
		You know what you look like?

				SETH
		No, Richie, what do I look like?

				RICHARD
		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

				SETH
		How?

				RICHARD
		Where are you right now?

				SETH
		What do you mean?

				RICHARD
		Where are you?

				SETH
		I'm here with you.

				RICHARD
		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

				SETH
		My shit is together.

				RICHARD
		It don't look together.

				SETH
		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

				RICHARD
		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

				CHET
			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

				CHET
			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

				SETH
		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

				CHET
		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
	NOSE.

	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

				SETH
		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

				RICHARD
			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

				SETH
		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

				SETH
		Whiskey!

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

				SETH
		What dya mean?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

				SETH
		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

				SETH
			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

				BIG EMILIO
			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

				SETH
		No, I'm going to count to three.

				BIG EMILIO
		Uno...

				SETH
		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

				JACOB
		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

				JACOB
		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

				SETH
		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

				RICHARD
		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

				SETH
		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

				RICHARD
		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

				SETH
		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Best in Mexico.

				SETH
		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

				RICHARD
		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

				SETH
		Who else?

				JACOB
		Pass.

				SETH
			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

				JACOB
			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

				SETH
		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll have one.

				JACOB
		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

				SETH
		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

				KATE
		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

				JACOB
		Why are you so agitated?

				SETH
		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

				JACOB
		He backed down.

				SETH
		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

				JACOB
		What are you going to do?

				SETH
			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

				JACOB
		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

				SETH
			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

				JACOB
		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

				SETH
		What did you call me?

				JACOB
		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

				SETH
		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

				SETH
		To your family.

				JACOB
		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

				JACOB
		Now, is your shit together?

				SETH
		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

				SETH
		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

				SCOTT
		Yeah, it's mine.

				SETH
		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

								  CUT TO:

	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

				SETH
		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

				SETH
			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

				RICHARD
		Yeah.

				SETH
		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

				RICHARD
			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

				SETH
		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

				SETH
		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

				JACOB
			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

				SETH
		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

				CHET
			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

				RICHARD
		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

				RICHARD
		How are you?

				SETH
		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

				SETH
		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

				RICHARD
		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

				RICHARD
			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

				SETH
		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

				WHORE
		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
	VAMPIRES.

	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

				SANTANICO
		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

				SANTANICO
		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

				BIG EMILIO
		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

				SETH
		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

				SEX MACHINE
		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

				SEX MACHINE
		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

				CHET
		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

	GULP.

	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

				CHET
		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

				CHET
		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

				FROST
		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

				SETH
		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

				RICHARD
		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

				SETH
		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

				SEX MACHINE
		He ain't your brother no more.

				SETH
		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

				JACOB
		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

				SETH
		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

				SETH
		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

				SETH
		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

				KATE
		Are you okay?

				SETH
		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

				KATE
		I'm really sorry.

				SETH
		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

				JACOB
		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

				JACOB
		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

				JACOB
		What the hell is that?

				FROST
		At first I just thought it was birds.

				SEX MACHINE
		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

				SETH
		It's bats.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

				JACOB
		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

				SEX MACHINE
		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

				SEX MACHINE
			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

				SEX MACHINE
		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

				SEX MACHINE
		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

				KATE
		Kate, what's yours?

				SEX MACHINE
		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

	WHAM !

	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

				SETH
		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

				JACOB
		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

				JACOB
		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

				SETH
		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

				SETH
		You too, preacher?

				JACOB
		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

				SETH
		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

				JACOB
		In the Winnebago.

				SETH
		In other words, no.

				SCOTT
		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

				SEX MACHINE
		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

				SETH
		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

				JACOB
		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

				SETH
		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

				FROST
		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

				SEX MACHINE
		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

				SCOTT
		That's werewolves.

				SEX MACHINE
		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

				KATE
		Does anybody have any silver?

				ALL
		No.

				KATE
		Then who cares?

				SCOTT
		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

				JACOB
		About two hours from now.

				KATE
		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

				SEX MACHINE
		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

				JACOB
		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

				SEX MACHINE
		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

				FROST
			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

				JACOB
		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

				SETH
		Aside from they're thirsty.

				FROST
		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

				JACOB
		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

				SEX MACHINE
		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

				SCOTT
		You could take their head off.

				SETH
		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

				SETH
		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

				JACOB
		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

				SETH
		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

				JACOB
		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

				KATE
		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

				FROST
		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

				JACOB
		What are you talking about?

				FROST
		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		Stop fucking saying that!

				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst!

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

				VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

				FROST
		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

				SEX MACHINE
		THIRST!

	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

				FROST
		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

				SEX MACHINE
		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

				SETH
		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

				JACOB
		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

				SETH
		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

				KATE
		We have to go back for Daddy!

				SETH
		Daddy's dead.

				KATE
		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

				SCOTT
		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

				SETH
		He needs our help!

				SCOTT
		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

				JACOB
		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

				SETH
		Did he...?

				JACOB
		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

				SETH
		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

				SETH
		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

				JACOB
			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

				KATE
		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

				JACOB
		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

				JACOB
			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

				JACOB
		What's this stuff?

				SETH
		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

				JACOB
		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

				SETH
		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

				JACOB
		Amen.

	MONTAGE

	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

				JACOB
		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

				SETH
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Kate, Scott?

				KATE
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Scott?

				SCOTT
		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

				JACOB
		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

				JACOB
		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

				KATE
		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

				JACOB
		Not good enough, swear to God.

				KATE
		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

				JACOB
		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

				SCOTT
		You don't believe in suicide.

				JACOB
		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

				JACOB
		Thank you, son.

				SETH
		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

				SETH
		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

				KATE
		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

				SETH
		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

				JACOB
		No!

				KATE
		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

				KATE
			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

				SETH
		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

				SCOTT
		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

				SETH
		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

				KATE
		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

				KATE
		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

				SCOTT
		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

				SETH
		How many bullets left, kid?

				KATE
		Not many.

				SETH
		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

				SETH
		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

				SETH
		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

				CARLOS (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

				CARLOS
			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

				CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

				SETH
		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

				CARLOS
		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

				SETH
		Have you ever been there before?

				CARLOS
		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

				SETH
		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

				CARLOS
		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

				SETH
		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

				CARLOS
		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

				SETH
		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

				CARLOS
		Twenty-eight.

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

				SETH AND CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


				CARLOS
		You like the car?

				SETH
		I said new, this is an '90.

				CARLOS
		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

				SETH
		So do I just follow you?

				CARLOS
		Yeah, follow us.


				SETH
		So let's do it.

				CARLOS
			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

				SETH
		I'm sorry.

				KATE
		Me too.

	Long pause.

				SETH
		See ya.

				KATE
		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

				KATE (O.S.)
		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

				KATE
		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

				SETH
		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

	A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
	surround it.

	CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

	The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
	WORLD OF LIQUOR.

	TITLE CARD:

				BIG SPRING, TEXAS
			   109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
			345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

	A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
	a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
	in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
	mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

	It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
	off duty for the day.

	The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


	INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
	stool behind the counter.

	A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

	A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
	glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
	bare feet. They look through magazines.

	Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
	GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
	beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
	seventeen.

	MCGRAW enters the store.

				MCGRAW
		Hot goddamn day!

				PETE
		Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
		the air conditioner blastin' all day
		long.

				MCGRAW
		Not even for lunch?

				PETE
		I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
		outta the microwave.

	McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
	every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
	joins Pete by the front counter.

				MCGRAW
		Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
		will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
		Those burritos are only fit for a
		hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
		bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
		tanked tonight.

				PETE
		Whatsamatter?

				MCGRAW
			(sighs)
		Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
		Every inch of it hot and miserable.
		First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
		got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
		boy of hers was workin' the grill.
		That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
		from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
		at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
		blanket like a sick dog by ten
		thirty.

				PETE
		Isn't there a law or something
		against retards serving food to the
		public?

				MCGRAW
		Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
		be. Who knows what goes on inside 
		Mongoloid's mind?

				PETE
		You could sue the shit out of her, ya
		know. That kid belongs under a circus
		tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
		own that fuckin' place.

				MCGRAW
		What the hell would I do with that
		grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
		enough of a cross to bear just taking
		care of that potato head. Then all
		this Abilene shit happened. You
		heard about that bank robbery in
		Abilene, didn't ya?

				PETE
		That's all that's been on the box
		all day. They killed some people
		didn't they?

				MCGRAW
		Four Rangers, three cops, and two
		civilians. And they took a lady bank
		teller as a hostage.

	Pete doesn't say anything.

				MCGRAW
		They'll probably make a run for the
		border, which would bring 'em this
		way. And if we get our hands on
		those shit asses, we're talking
		payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
		I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
		commode.

				PETE
		Knock yourself out.

	McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
	exits in the bathroom.

	The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
	with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
	We see that the girl is crying.

				BLACK SUITED MAN #1
			(to Pete)
		Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
		you, asshole?
			(points to the tearful prep
			 school girl)
		Do you want this little girl to die?
			(pointing to the blonde with
			 the other guy)
		Or that little girl? Or your
		bosombuddy with the badge? Or
		yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
		I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
		Wild Bunch if I even think you're
		fuckin' with me.

	The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
	bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
	And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
	is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
	the blonde.

	Everybody speaks low and fast.

				PETE
		What do you want from me? I did what
		you said.

				SETH
		Letting him use your toilet? No store
		does that.

				PETE
		He comes in here every day and we
		bullshit. He's used my toilet a
		thousand times. If I told him no,
		he'd know something was up.

				SETH
		I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
		here, in his car, and down the road or
		you can change the name of this
		place to "Benny's World of Blood."

	Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
	leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
	at Pete.

				SETH
		Were you giving that pig signals?

				PETE
		What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
		anything!

	Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

				SETH
		He says you were scratching.

				PETE
		I wasn't scratching!

				SETH
		You callin' him a liar?

	Pete controls himself.

				PETE
		I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
		simply saying that if I was
		scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
		not because I was signaling the cop,
		it's because I'm fuckin' scared
		shitless.

	Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
	Seth.

				RICHARD
		The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
		I just go in there, blow his head off
		and get outta here.

				PETE
		Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
		act natural, and I'm acting as natural
		-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
		think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
		Award for how natural I'm acting. You
		asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
		my best.

				SETH
		Yeah, well, your best better get a
		helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
		gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
		worse.

	The toilet FLUSHES.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool.

	Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

	McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
	of the situation.

				MCGRAW
		Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
		it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
		in front of the box and just drink
		booze. How much is the bottle?

				PETE
		Six-fifty.

	Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
	and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

	McGraw goes down screaming.

	Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

	Seth charges forward.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		What the fuck was that about?

				RICHARD
			(in a low monotone)
		He signaled the Ranger.

				PETE
			(hysterical)
		I didn't.
			(to Seth)
		You gotta believe me, I didn't.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		When they were talkin', he mouthed
		the words "Help Us."

				PETE
		You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

	Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

	Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

				SETH
		What the fuck is wrong with you --

				RICHARD
		Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
		cooler with your back turned. I was by
		the magazines, I could see his face.
		And I saw him mouth:

	Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

	While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
	from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
	out a gun from it.

	Seth releases his brother.

				SETH
		Start the car.

		Shut up and start the car.

	Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

	...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
	the hand.

	Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

	Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

	Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

	Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

	Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

	The two girls have run out screaming.


				SETH
			(yelling)
		Richie? You okay?

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
		I told you that bastard said, "Help
		us!"

				PETE
			(yelling)
		I never said help us!

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Well that don't matter now, 'cause
		you got about two fuckin' seconds
		to live! Richie!

				RICHARD
			(yelling)
		Yeah?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		When I count three, shoot out the
		bottles behind him!

				RICHARD
		Gotcha!

				SETH
		One... Two... Three.


	The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

	They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

	Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
	RAIN down on him.

	Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

	Richard keeps FIRING.

	Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
	fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

	The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

	The fireball lands behind the counter.

	The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
	screams from behind the counter.

	Seth smiles to himself and stands.

	Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

	Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
	still holding his weapon and FIRING.

	Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

	Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
	Pastry display.

	Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.



	EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

	They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into

				SETH
		What did I tell you? What did I tell
		you? Buy the road map and leave.

				RICHARD
		What am I supposed to do, Seth?
		He recognized us.

				SETH
		He didn't recognize shit.

	Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

				RICHARD
		Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
		looked at us -- you especially --
		I knew he knew.


	They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
	starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
	hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

				SETH
		Low profile. Do you know what the

	CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

	prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
	his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
	slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

	Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
	boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

	The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
	and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs

	INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

	Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
	cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
	the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

	It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
	FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
	category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
	JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
	and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
	possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
	sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
	complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
	Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
	who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
	garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
	of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

				JACOB
		We got about two more hours of day
		light left. That'll get us into
		El Paso, which is right next to the
		border. We'll stop at a motel --

				SCOTT
		Stop? We're not going to actually
		stop at a motel, are we?

	Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
	that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

				SCOTT AND KATE
		We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
		those over priced roach havens. We're
		self contained.

				JACOB
		Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
		overzealous, but give me a break, I
		just bought it.

	Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

				SCOTT
		Why, just look at all this. You got
		your kitchen --

				KATE
		-- you got your microwave --

				SCOTT
		-- you got your sink --

				KATE
		-- you got your shower --

				SCOTT
		-- see this, television!

				KATE
		Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
		real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

				JACOB
		Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
		introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
		what say we drop this?

				SCOTT
			(to Kate)
		The truth hurts.

				KATE
			(to Scott)
		It's the bitterest of pills.

				JACOB
		You two ought to start a stand-up
		act, because you're just wasting your
		humor on me.

				KATE
		Ain't it the truth.

				SCOTT
		Why do you want to stop?

				JACOB
		I'm exhausted.

				SCOTT
		Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
		into Mexico.

	Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
	new motor home."

				JACOB
		I just bet you would. Don't even thin
		about it. Besides, I want to have one
		night's sleep in an
		honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
		the home are okay, but they're not
		like a real bed.

				KATE
		Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
		swim.

				SCOTT
		I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
		the bathroom.

	Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
	restroom.

	Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
	silence before...

				KATE
		Dad, when I called the machine to
		check our messages there was one from
		Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
		wouldn't permanently replace you until
		we came back. He said when we come
		home, if you still feel the same
		way --

				JACOB
		That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
		call him tomorrow and tell him not
		to bother waiting.

				KATE
		I didn't want to talk about this in
		front of Scott because he gets upset.
		But you don't believe in God
		anymore?

				JACOB
		Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
		know this is hard on you kids. After
		Jenny's death, this is probably the
		last thing you need. But I can't do
		it any longer. My congregation needs
		spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
		get that from me anymore. My faith is
		gone. To answer your question, yes,
		I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
		them? No. After Jenny died, I just
		thought, what's the point?

				KATE
			(pushing him)
		It's just, all our lives you've been
		a pastor. For twenty years you've
		preached trust in the lord. And then
		one day you wake up and say fuck him?

				JACOB
		I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
		connected anymore.

				KATE
		That happens, you'll get it back.

				JACOB
		Kate, give your old man a little
		credit. Every person who chooses the
		service of God as their life's work
		has something in common. I don't care
		if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
		a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
		many times during your life you'll
		look at your reflection in the mirror
		and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
		all done it. I'm not going through a
		lapse. What I've experienced is closer
		to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
		your faith. I've just decided not to
		devote my life to God anymore.

				KATE
		What do you think Mom would say?

				JACOB
		Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

	She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
	scared and looks an absolute mess.

				SETH
		Don't say a word.

	The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of

	She shuts up.

	Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
	wound.

				SETH
		Let me help you.

	He helps him get his jacket off.

				SETH
		How's it feel?

				RICHARD
		How ya think, it hurts like a

	Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
	the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
	against.

				SETH
		I got both rooms on either side of us,

		What time does it get dark around

				HOSTAGE
		About seven.

				SETH
		Good. I'm going towards the border to

				RICHARD
		Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
		can arrange a better deal than thirty
		percent.

				SETH
		That's their standard deal, brother.
		They ain't about to change it for us.

				RICHARD
		Did you even to try to negotiate?

				SETH
		These guys ain't spic fire cracker

		know the meaning of the word "barter".
		You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
		them thirty percent of your loot. It's
		scripture. So it is written, so shall
		it be done. You want sanctuary, you
		pay the price, and the price is thirty
		percent.

				RICHARD
		All I'm saying --

				SETH
		-- This conversation is over.

	Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
	hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

				SETH
		Now, we need to have a talk. What's
		your name?

				HOSTAGE
		Gloria.

	He shakes her hand.

				SETH
		Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
		brother Richie. Let's cut to the
		chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
		and all I want is a yes or no answer.
		Do you want to live through this?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good. Then let me explain the house
		rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
		along like a house on fire. Rule number
		one: No noise, no question. You make a
		noise...
			(he holds up his .45)
		...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
		question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
		you absolutely, positively clear about
		rule number one?

				GLORIA
		Yes.

				SETH
		Rule number two: You do what we say,
		when we say it. If you don't, see rule
		number one.

	Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
	cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
	hammer.

				SETH
		Rule number three: Don't you ever try
		and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
		five little friends, and they all run
		faster 'n you can. Got it?

	She nods her head yes.

	He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

				SETH
		Open your eyes.

	She does.

				SETH
		Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
		rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
		get out of this alive. I give you my
		word. Okay?

	She nods her head yes.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I'll be back in a bit.

	He exits.

	Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
	across the room in the chair.


				RICHARD
		Wanna come up here on the bed and
		watch TV with me?


	You can tell she doesn't want to.

	He pats the empty space next to him.

				RICHARD
		Come on.

	She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
	next to him.


	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

	A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the

		Things are real hot here. Crossing's

			(pause)
		Don't worry, we'll get across. But
		when we do, where do we go?
			(pause)
		Can we make it as close to the border

		The quicker we're in your protection,

			(pause)
		Okay, where?

		I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll

				STANLEY CHASE
		For the time being we are very

		fugitives in the next forty-eight
		hours. The Bureau, local law
		enforcement and the Texas Rangers
		have all joined forces in forming a
		dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
		Gecko.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Agent Chase, does it appear that they
		are heading for Mexico.

				STANLEY CHASE
		Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
		alerted the Mexican authorities. They
		intend to cooperate every way possible
		in bringing these fugitives to
		justice.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Are you optimistic about the safety of
		the hostage they took in Abilene,
		Gloria Hill?

				STANLEY CHASE
		We've received no news one way or the
		other. We can only hope for the best.

				KELLY HOUGE
		What about the report from an
		eyewitness at the liquor store who
		said one of the brothers was shot?

				STANLEY CHASE
		This can't be confirmed at this time,
		but we do believe it to be true. We
		have reason to believe it was the
		youngest brother Richard, and he was
		shot in the vicinity of his neck and
		shoulders by the store's clerk.

				KELLY HOUGE
		Is it safe to assume that because the
		death count involved and the loss of
		life of law enforcement officers, that
		the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
		force are taking this manhunt
		personally?

				STANLEY CHASE
		I would say that's a very safe
		assumption.

		Is it safe to assume since the law

		sick and deviate nature, that they
		will be too busy fucking each other
		up the ass to actually catch The
		Gecko Brothers?
			(in an FBI voice)
		I would say that's a very safe

				SETH
		Yeah, I saw the border. Through

		risked getting. What's the TV say?

		They're going to apprehend us in
		forty-eight hours.

	Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

				SETH

		I gotta figure a way to get across

				RICHARD
		Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
		in and wait for things to cool down.

				SETH
		Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
		worse before it gets any fuckin'
		better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
		killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
		ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
		find us, and when they find us,
		they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
		very personal when ya kill their law
		enforcement officers. The El Paso
		police have already started a motel
		and hotel search for us.

				RICHARD
		How do you know?

				SETH
		I heard it on the radio. We gotta get

	Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
	He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
	Then he BURSTS open the door.

	The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
	obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

				SETH

		Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

	Richard rises from the bed.

				RICHARD
		Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me

	Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

	Richard backs up.

				SETH
		Yeah, explain it to me. I need an

				RICHARD

		There's nothing wrong with me,

		No.

		became a whole different person.

				SETH
			(slowly approaching)
		Is it me? Is it my fault?

				RICHARD
		It's not your fault, it's her fault!

	Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
	holding tightly to his wrist.

				SETH
		Is this my fault? Do you think this
		is what I am?

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		This is not me! I am a professional
		fucking thief. I steal money. You try
		to stop me, god help you. But I don't
		kill people I don't have to, and I
		don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
		how it's done. Do you understand?

				RICHARD
		Seth, if you were me --

				SETH
		Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
		yes.

				RICHARD
		Yes.

				SETH
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

				RICHARD
		Yes, Seth, I understand.

	Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

				SETH
			(whispers in Richie's ear)
		We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
		sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
		and rice and beans. None of this
		shit's gonna matter.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
	home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
	Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
	the Old-Timer.

				KATE
		I can't believe he's stopping here.
		This place looks totally cruddy.

	Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
	home.

				KATE
		Dad, why are we stopping here?

	He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

				JACOB
		There's nothing wrong with this
		place.

				KATE
		It's a flop house.

				JACOB
		It's not a flop house. It's basic
		and simple. That doesn't make it a
		flop house.

				KATE
		If it doesn't have a pool, we're
		looking for a new place.

	Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
	courtyard.

				JACOB
		It has a bed. That's all I care about.

				KATE
		Other places have beds, they also have
		cable TV, a gym, room service...


	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
	thinking about how he's going to get over the border
	tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
	Fuller's motor home.

	Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
	Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
	THUD... THUD...

				KATE
		Owww, my head.

	Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
	window.

				JACOB
		Watch where you're going!

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
	up at the giant motor home.

	JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

	Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

				SCOTT
		What's this guy's problem?

				JACOB
		I have no idea.

	Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
	move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

	HONK!

				JACOB
		Anytime, man.

	The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
	on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
	side to let them pass.

	Pass they do!

				KATE
		Creepy guy.

	SETH

	The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
	just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
	unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
	border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
	room #9.


	INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

	The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
	the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
	beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
	on the bed.

	Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
	electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

	KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
	shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
	POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
	He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
	oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		What?

	From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
		disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

	Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
	the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

				JACOB
		I hope none of this is disturbing you.

	Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
	he smiles.

	Jacob opens the door and sees...

	... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
	nicest guy in the entire world.

				RICHARD
		Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
		Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
		Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
		lady friend need some ice and we don't
		seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
		possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
		right back.

				JACOB
			(still partially asleep)
		Sure.

	We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
	ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
	couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

	He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
	closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

				JACOB
		What is this?

	Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

				SETH
		It's called a punch.

	Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
	and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
	mouth.

				RICHARD
		Sit down.

	Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

				RICHARD
		Good boy.

	Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
	his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		What's your name?

				JACOB
		Jacob.

				SETH
		Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
		down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
		I'll shoot you in the face.

	Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

				SETH
			(to Richard)
		Okay, move the Jap over there.

	Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

				RICHARD
		Upsy daisy.

	...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

	Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
	to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

				SETH
			(to his hostages)
		What's the story with you two? You a
		couple of fags?

				JACOB
		He's my son.

				SETH
		How does that happen? You don't look
		Japanese.

				JACOB
		Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

				SETH
		Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

				JACOB
		What's this about, money?

				SETH
		It's about money, all right, but not
		yours. You see, me and my brother here
		are in a little hot water and we need
		your assistance.

	The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
	Kate walks in.

	The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

	Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
	and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
	ready to spit.

				SETH
			(to Scott and Jacob)
		Stop!

	Jacob and Scott freeze.

	Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
	positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

				KATE
		What's going on?

				RICHARD
		We're having a wet bikini contest,
		and you just won.

				JACOB
			(to Kate)
		It's okay, honey. Everything's going
		to be all right.

				SETH
		Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
		do nothin' stupid.
			(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
			 who are still standing)
		You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

	They slowly sit.

	Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

	Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
	for their own reasons.

				SETH
			(to Jacob)
		Where are the keys to the motor home?

				JACOB
		On the dresser.

				SETH
		Richie, take the keys. Start that big
		bastard up, and drive it up front.

	Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
	feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

	He looks in her face.

	CLOSE-UP KATE
		
	She smiles at him.

				KATE
		Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
		my pussy?

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD
		
				RICHARD
		Sure.


				SETH (O.S.)
		Richard!

	Richard's eyes go to Seth.

	Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

				SETH
		Not when you get around to it, now.

	Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
	room.

				SETH
			(pointing at Kate)
		You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
		put on some clothes.

	She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
	bathroom.

	Seth GRABS her wrist.

				SETH
		You got three minutes. One second
		longer, I shoot your father in the
		face. Do you understand what I just
		said?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		Do you believe me?

				KATE
		Yes.

				SETH
		You damn well better. Go.

	She goes into the bathroom.

				JACOB
		Look, if you want the motor home, just
		take it and get out.

	Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
	hostages.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
		easy.

	We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

				SETH
		Get ready to move out, we're all going
		on a little ride.

	Jacob shakes his head "no."

				JACOB
		Not a chance.

				SETH
		Come again?

				JACOB
		If you're taking people, take me. But
		my kids aren't going anywhere with
		you.

				SETH
		Sorry, I need everybody.

				JACOB
		My children are not going with you,
		and that's that.

				SETH
			(angry)
		That's not fuckin' that...
			(holds up his gun)
		this is fuckin' this.
			(he calms down and looks
			 at Scott)
		Go sit over there.

	Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
	leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
	conversational tone.

				SETH
		I ain't got time to fuck around with
		you, so I'll make this simple. Take
		your kids and get in the car, or I'll
		execute all three of you right now.
			(he cocks the gun and puts
			 it right in Jacob's face)
		What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

	Jacob looks at him.

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Good.
			(to Scott)
		Your old man's all right, he just
		saved your life.

	Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

				SETH
		Times up, Princess.

	The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
	T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

				SETH
		Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
	the Lone Star night.


	INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

	Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
	and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

				KATE
		Excuse me.

	Richard zeros in on her.

				RICHARD
		What?

				KATE
		Where are you taking us?

				RICHARD
		Mexico.

				KATE
		What's in Mexico?

				RICHARD
		Mexicans.

	He doesn't smile.

	In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
	wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
	seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
	calmly.

				SETH
			(reading his driver's license)
		Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
		ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
		course it is.
			(motioning behind him)
		What are their names?

				JACOB
		Scott and Kate.

	Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

				SETH
		Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
		Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

	Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

				SETH
		Who's this?

				JACOB
		My wife.

				SETH
		Where is the little lady?

				JACOB
		In heaven.

				SETH
		She's dead?

				JACOB
		Yes, she is.

				SETH
		How'd she die?

				JACOB
		Auto wreck.

				SETH
		Come on, gimme some more details.
		How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
		kill her?

				JACOB
		No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
		on the car weren't great. She had to
		stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
		she crashed, she died.

				SETH
		Died instantly?

				JACOB
		Not quite. She was trapped in the
		wreck for about six hours before she
		passed on.

				SETH
		Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
		it in and break it off, don't they?

				JACOB
		Yes, they do.

	Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
	license.

				SETH
		Is this real?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I've seen one of these before. A
		friend of mine had himself declared
		a minister of his own religion. Away
		to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
		doing, or are you the real McCoy?

				JACOB
		Real McCoy.

				SETH
		You're a preacher?

				JACOB
		I was a minister.

				SETH
		Was? As in not anymore?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Why'd ya quit?

				JACOB
		I think I've gotten about as up close
		and personal with you as I'm gonna
		get. Now if you need me like I think
		you need me, you're not gonna kill me
		'cause I won't answer your stupid,
		prying questions. So, with all due
		respect, mind your own business.

				SETH
		I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
		be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
		friendly. But you're right, enough
		with the getting to know you shit.
		Now, there's two ways we can play this
		hand. One way is me and you go round
		an' round all fuckin' night. The other
		way, is we reach some sort of an
		understanding. Now, if we go down that
		first path at the end of the day, I'll
		win. But we go down the second, we'll
		both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
		ass about you or your fuckin' family.
		Y'all can live forever or die this
		second and I don't care which. The
		only things I do care about are me
		that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
		our money. And right now I need to get
		those three things into Mexico. Now,
		stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
		you don't give a shit about seeing me
		and my brother receiving justice, or
		the bank getting its money back. Right
		now all you care about is the safety
		of your daughter, your son and
		possibly yourself. Am I correct?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		I thought so. You help us get across
		the border without incident, stay with
		us the rest of the night without
		trying anything funny, and in the
		morning we'll let you and your family
		go. That way everybody gets what they
		want. You and your kids get out of
		this alive and we get into Mexico.
		Everybody's happy.

				JACOB
		How do I know you'll keep your word?

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
		this shit.

				JACOB
		You want me to sit here and be
		passive. The only way being passive in
		this situation makes sense is if I
		believe you'll let us go. I'm not
		there yet. You have to convince me
		you're telling the truth.

				SETH
		Look, dickhead, the only thing you
		need to be convinced about is that
		you're stuck in a situation with a
		coupla real mean motor scooters. I
		don't wanna hafta worry about you all
		fuckin' night. And I don't think you
		wanna be worrying about my brother's
		intentions toward your daughter all
		night. You notice the way he looked
		at her, didn't ya?

				JACOB
		Yes.

				SETH
		Didn't like it, did ya?

				JACOB
		No, I didn't.

				SETH
		Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
		I'm willing to make a deal. You
		behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
		try to escape. I'll keep my brother
		off your daughter and let you all
		loose in the morning.

				JACOB
		You won't let him touch her?

				SETH
		I can handle Richie, don't worry.

	The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
	Seth sticks out his hand.

				SETH
		I give you my word.

	Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
	word.

				SETH
			(hand sticks out)
		My words, my law. Better you not take
		it, and that's just where we are,
		then take it and not mean it.

	Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

				JACOB
		If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
		don't give a fuck how many guns you
		have, nothing will stop me from
		killing him.

				SETH
		Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
		kill all of you.
			(calling to the back)
		Kate, honey!

				KATE
		Yeah.

				SETH
		You must have a bible in here, don't
		cha?

				KATE
		Yeah, we got a bible.

				SETH
		Get it and bring it up here, will
		ya, please?

	Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
	front.

				SETH
		Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
			(to Jacob)
		Put your hand on it.

	Jacob does.

				SETH
		Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
		try to escape and you'll get us across
		the border.

				JACOB
		I swear to God I won't try to escape
		and I'll do my best to get you into
		Mexico.

				SETH
		You best better get it done, Pops.

	Seth places his hand on the Bible.

				SETH
		I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
		morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
		also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
		I'll slit all your throats.

	Kate turns to him.

				KATE
		What?

				RICHARD
		In the room. Were you serious, or were
		you just foolin' around? I'm just
		bringing it up, 'cause if you really
		want me to do that for you, I will.

				KATE
		Do what?

				RICHARD
			(in a whisper)
		What you said to me in the room.

				KATE
			(whispers back)
		What did I say?

				RICHARD
			(whisper)
		You asked me if I would --

		Richard!

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		What?

	Seth and Jacob.

				SETH
		I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say
		talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say
		to one another. So cut the chatter.

	Richard turns to Kate.

				RICHARD
			(quiet)
		We'll talk later.

	Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

								  CUT TO:


	EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

	Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
	Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
	are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
	stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
	Fuller's mobile home.


	INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
	up and goes into action.

				SETH
		Okay everybody, it's show time.
		Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

	Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

				SETH
		Scott, you come up front with your
		daddy.

	Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

				JACOB
		I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

				SETH
		As long as you're cool, she'll be
		cool. What're ya gonna say?

				JACOB
		I don't have the slightest idea.

				SETH
		Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
		gun next to Kate's temple.

	Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
	closing the door behind him.

	Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
	thing began.

				SCOTT
		What are you gonna do?

				JACOB
		I'm gonna try and get us across the
		border.

				SCOTT
		No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
		they're back there.

	Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


	INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

	The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
	small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

	Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
	Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
	mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

	Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

	Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
	should open the door.

	Everybody talks low and quiet.

				RICHARD
		This isn't gonna work.

				SETH
		Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

				RICHARD
		I just want to go on record as saying
		this is a bad idea.

				SETH
		Duly noted. Now, shut up.

	Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

				RICHARD
			(to himself)
		They're gonna search the van.

				SETH
			(offhand)
		As long as you don't act like a
		fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

				RICHARD
		What does that mean?

				SETH
			(distracted)
		What?

	Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

				RICHARD
		You just called me a fuckin' nut.

				SETH
		No, I didn't.

				RICHARD
		Yes, you did. You said as long as I
		don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
		that I've been acting like a fuckin'
		nut.

				SETH
		Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
		cool.

				RICHARD
		You meant that, but you meant the
		other, too.

	Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

				SETH
			(serious as a heart attack)
		This ain't the time, Richard.

				RICHARD
			(his voice rising)
		Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
		fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
		that stops the train on its tracks.

				SETH
			(real quiet and violent)
		Keep your voice down.

				RICHARD
			(quiet back)
		Or what?

	BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT		

				JACOB
		Have you forgotten about your sister?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill us. They get us
		across the border, they're gonna take
		us out in the desert and shoot us.

				JACOB
		If they get over the border, they're
		gonna let us go.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I watch those reality shows.
		They never let anybody go. Any cop
		will tell you, in a situation like
		this, you get a chance, you go for it.
		This is our chance.

				JACOB
		What about Kate?

				SCOTT
		They're gonna kill her anyway. At
		least now with all these cops we've
		got a fighting chance.

				JACOB
		Son, I have this situation under
		control. I know exactly what I'm
		doing. You're going to have to trust
		me on this.

				SCOTT
		If trusting you means trusting those
		fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
		you don't tell the cops, I will.


	Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
	to him.

				JACOB
		Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
		do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
		me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
		running this show, I make the
		decisions.

				SCOTT
		He's running the show.

				JACOB
		I'm running the show. I make the
		plays, and you back the plays I
		make. Stop thinking with your fucking
		balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
		desperate men with nothing to fucking
		lose ain't the time to "go for it."
		I need your cover. Cover my ass.

	There's a HONK behind them.

	They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
	BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

	A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

				BORDER GUARD
		How many with you?

				JACOB
		Just my son and I.

				BORDER GUARD
		What is your purpose in Mexico?

				JACOB
		Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
		first bullfight.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

				RICHARD
		I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
		thing I did?

				SETH
		This ain't the time.

				RICHARD
		Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
		ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
		out? Yeah, you're right, that was
		pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
		stupid. But you know what? I can fix
		that right now.

	SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
	Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
	Richard fall in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		What was that?

				JACOB
		Oh, that's just my daughter in the
		bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD
		You said it was just you and your son.

				JACOB
		I meant me, my son and my daughter.

	CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

				BORDER GUARD
		Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

	BACK TO BATHROOM

	CLOSE-UP KATE

	We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
	around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

	Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
	we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

				KATE
		I'm in the bathroom.

				BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
		It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

				KATE
		It's open.

	We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
	face. She's looking up.

	BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

	HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
	on the toilet.

				KATE
		Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

				BORDER GUARD
		Excuse me.

	He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
	Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
	the floor of the shower knocked out.

	Seth and Kate meet eyes.

	He gives her the O.K. signal.

								  CUT TO:

	BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

	We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
	getting smaller as we drive away from it.

	Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

				SCOTT
		It's clear.

	Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

				SETH
		Goddamn, that was. intense!

	Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
	farther and farther away. No cars following.

				SETH
			(to himself)
		We did it.
			(pause)
		We're in Mexico.

	Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

	Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
	along with Scott.

	Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
	the van.

	Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
	all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
	turns to Kate.

				SETH
			(loud and happy)
		Come here, Kate!

	Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

	He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
	and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
	dizzily onto the bed.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		You were magnificent! You told him to
		shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
		the shower, and I'm thinking to
		myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
		I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
		do -- he shuts the fucking door!

	Kate kind of half smiles.

				SETH
		If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
		fuckin' marry you!

	Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

				SETH
		I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
		raised a fuckin' woman.

	Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

				JACOB
		We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
		Now it's time for your part, letting
		us go.

				SETH
		Pops, when you're right, you're right,
		and you are right.

				KATE
			(suddenly brightens)
		You're gonna let us go?

				SETH
		In the morning, darlin', in the
		morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
		F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
		through hell, and I know I've been one
		rough pecker, but from here on end you
		guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
		me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
		Jacob, keep going on this road till
		you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
		When you get to Digayo, turn this big
		bastard left, go on down for a few
		miles, then you see a bar called "The
		Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
		can't miss it.

				JACOB
		Then?

				SETH
		Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
		going.

	He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
	to Richard.

								  CUT TO:

	CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
	his face.

				SETH (O.S.)
		 C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
		 career out of it.

	Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
	foot of the bed.

				SETH
		You okay?

				RICHARD
			(disoriented)
		Yeah, I think so. What happened?

				SETH
		I don't know, you just passed out.

				RICHARD
		I did?

				SETH
		Yeah, we were just standing there. You
		said something about your shoulder
		hurting, then you just hit the ground
		like a sack of potatoes.

				RICHARD
		Really?

				SETH
		Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
		the toilet hard. It scared the shit
		outta me. Sure you're okay?

				RICHARD
		Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
		fucked up.

				SETH
		Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
		clear your head right up. We are
		officially Mexicans.

				RICHARD
		What?

				SETH
		We are...
			(singing)
		"South of the border down Mexico way."

				RICHARD
		We are?

				SETH
		Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
		right now. We get there, we pound
		booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
		us to El Ray. And then me and you,
		brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
		like them apples?

	Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

				RICHARD
		Far out.
			(pause)
		Where are my glasses?

				SETH
		They broke when you fell.

				RICHARD
		Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

				SETH
		Don't worry about it, we'll get you
		some glasses.

				RICHARD
		What dya mean, don't worry about it.
		Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
		I can't fuckin' see.

				SETH
		When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
		of it.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, like a Mexican
		hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
		fuckin' prescription.

				SETH
		It's not a big deal, unless you make
		it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
		Richie, stop bringing me down with
		bullshit.

	Jacob calls to the back.

				JACOB
		Guys! We're here.

								  CUT TO:

	A neon sign that flashes:

		THE TITTY TWISTER
		 Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

	Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
	on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
	well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
	by a neon hand.


	EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
	The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
	crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
	Mexico.

	The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
	nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
	miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
	parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
	RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
	outside reading things like: 

	"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
	"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
	"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
	"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
	THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
	"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
	TWISTER DANCERS."

	In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
	out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
	A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
	A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
	lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

				CHET
		Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
		go. At the Titty Twister we're
		slashing pussy in half! This is a
		pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
		vast selection of pussy! We got white
		pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
		yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
		wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
		bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
		smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
		pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
		pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
		pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
		it, you don't want it!

	The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
	lot and stops.


	INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

	What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
	out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

				SETH
			(to the group)
		Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
		Here's the deal; this place closes at
		dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
		sometime before dawn. Which by my
		guesstimate is somewhere between three
		or four hours from now. So we're gonna
		go in there, take a seat, have a drink
		-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
		for Carlos. That could be an hour,
		that could be three hours, I don't
		know which. But when he gets here,
		me and Richie are going to leave
		with him. After we split, you guys
		are officially out of this stewpot.
		Let me just say I'm real happy about
		where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
		don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
		with me" attitude going on. Now, if
		everybody just keeps playin' it cool
		-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
		-- everybody's gonna get what they
		want. Comprende, amigos?

	Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

				SETH
		Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
		I'm buyin'.


	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
	The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
	Fuller family step out into the night.

	They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
	It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

				JACOB
		Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

				SETH
		Shit, I been to bars make this place
		look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

				RICHARD
		I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
		been to some fucked up places in my
		time, but that place is fucked up.

	Seth can't believe it.

				SETH
			(in a baby talk voice)
		Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
		baby too afraid to go into the big
		scary bar?

	The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
	but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
	personal.

				RICHARD
		That's what you think?

				SETH
		That's how you're lookin', Richie.

				RICHARD
		I'm lookin' scared?

				SETH
		That's what you look like.

				RICHARD
		You know what you look like?

				SETH
		No, Richie, what do I look like?

				RICHARD
		You're lookin' green.

	That's not what Seth expected to hear.

				SETH
		How?

				RICHARD
		Where are you right now?

				SETH
		What do you mean?

				RICHARD
		Where are you?

				SETH
		I'm here with you.

				RICHARD
		No, you're not. You're sippin'
		margaritas in El Ray. But we're
		not in El Ray. We're here --
		getting ready to go in there.
		You're so pleased with yourself
		about getting into Mexico, you
		think the job's down. It ain't.
		Get back on the clock. That's a
		fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
		there for a coupla hours, in all
		likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
		So get your shit together, brother.

				SETH
		My shit is together.

				RICHARD
		It don't look together.

				SETH
		Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
		doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
		just not used to seein' me happy,
		'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
		years since I been happy. But my shit
		is forever together.

	Richard believes Seth's response.

				RICHARD
		Okay, just checkin'.

	They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
	the microphone.

				CHET
			(yelling into the microphone)
		Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
		Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
		price, you get another piece of pussy,
		of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
		Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
		If you can find cheaper pussy
		anywhere, fuck it!

	Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

				CHET
			(in microphone, towards Kate)
		What's this? A new flavor approaching.
		Apple Pie Pussy.

				SETH
		Step aside, asshole.

	Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

				CHET
		Not so fast, Slick.

	Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
	the BONE SNAPS in two.

	Chet lets out a SCREAM.

	Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
	NOSE.

	Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

	Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
	SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

	After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
	to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

	Chet is OUT.

	The whole altercation took two seconds.

	Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
	everyone.

				SETH
		Now, is my shit together, or is my
		shit together?

	Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

				RICHARD
			(slappin' Seth five)
		Your shit is forever together!

	They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
	and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


	INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

	If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
	from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
	ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
	they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
	and the beer at closing.

	In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
	while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
	at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
	BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
	bikers and truckers.

	One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
	name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
	the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
	ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
	crowd.

	Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
	here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
	but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

	Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
	They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
	Seth is the first to say something.

				SETH
		Now this is my kinda place! I could
		become a regular.

	The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
	as they approach.

	Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
	populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
	look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
	up to the bar.

				SETH
		Whiskey!

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in English)
		You can't come in here.

				SETH
		What dya mean?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This is a private club. You're not
		welcome.

				SETH
		Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
		to drink here?

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		This bar is for bikers and truckers
		only.
			(points his finger to Seth)
		You, get out!

	Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
	HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to Seth in Spanish)
		Walk, Pendaho.

	Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

				SETH
			(low)
		Take your hand off me.

				BIG EMILIO
			(Spanish)
		I'm going to count to three.

				SETH
		No, I'm going to count to three.

				BIG EMILIO
		Uno...

				SETH
		Two..

	Jacob jumps in the middle.

				JACOB
		Now wait a minute, there's no reason
		to get ugly. There's just a
		misunderstanding going on here. You
		said this bar is for truckers and
		bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

	Everybody looks at Jacob.

	As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

				JACOB
		If you look outside your door, parked
		in your parking lot, you'll see a big
		ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
		In order to drive that legally, you
		need a class two driver's license.
		That is the same license that the
		DMV requires truck drivers to carry
		in order to drive a truck.
			(he takes the license out
			 of his wallet and lays it
			 on the bar)
		That is me, and this is my class two
		license. This is a truck driver's bar,
		I am a truck driver, and these are
		my friends.

	Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

	Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
	everyone in the party and smiles.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Jacob)
		Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
		can I get you?

	Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

				SETH
		Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

	Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
	smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
	But instead he just says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Coming right up.

	Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
	party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
	buddy punch on the shoulder.

				RICHARD
		Good job, Pops.

	Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

				SETH
		That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
		number one problem with Mexico, it's
		not service oriented. I was feelin'
		so good, and those fuckin' spies
		brought me down.

	Richard puts his arm around Seth.

				RICHARD
		Fuck 'em, shake it off.

	Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
	at the guy, still pissed.

				SETH
		You serve food, Jose?

	Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
	but he just smiles and says,

				RAZOR CHARLIE
		Best in Mexico.

				SETH
		I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
		table, send over a waitress to take
		our order.

	Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

	We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
	Charlie's head.

	The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
	walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
	from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

	The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
	wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

	Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

				RICHARD
		Anytime you want a lap dance with that
		broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

	He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
	surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
	words about the party in Spanish.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(in Spanish)
		They're not the normal road trash we
		normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
		No one knows they're here.

	The five of them find a table and sit down.

	Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
	bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

				SETH
		Who else?

				JACOB
		Pass.

				SETH
			(picking a fight)
		Why not, against your religion?

				JACOB
			(won't be baited)
		No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
		now.

				SETH
		Suit yourself, more for me.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty?

	Scott shakes his head no.

				SETH
			(to Kate)
		How 'bout you?
			(pointing at Scott and Kate)
		are safer in here with us than
		wandering around a Mexican border town
		all night long. Just don't do nothin'
		stupid and we'll all get along fine.
			(to Scott)
		Scotty, you sure you don't want a
		drink?

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll have one.

				JACOB
		No you won't.

	Seth pours Scott a shot.

				SETH
		Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
		don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
		up, boy.

	Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
	on-drinker's tremor.

	Seth turns to Kate.

				SETH
		How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
		round two?

				KATE
		Okay.

	Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
	knocks it back.

				RICHARD
			(to Seth)
		Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
		just created a monster.

	Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

				JACOB
		Why are you so agitated?

				SETH
		I'm still stewing about that ape
		laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
		bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
		too.

				JACOB
		He backed down.

				SETH
		He's smilin' at us. But behind his
		smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
		I hear that loud and clear.

				JACOB
		What are you going to do?

				SETH
			(picking up the whiskey bottle)
		I'm gonna just sit here and drain
		this bottle. And when I've drunk the
		last drop, if I still feel then, the
		way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
		bottle and break it over his melon
		head.

				JACOB
		Before we stepped in here, you told
		all of us to be cool. That means you,
		too.

				SETH
			(tossing it off)
		I never said do what I do, I said do
		what I say.

				JACOB
		Are you so much a fucking loser, you
		can't tell when you've won?

	Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
	believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
	down his drinking glass.

				SETH
		What did you call me?

				JACOB
		Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
		asked a question. Would you like me to
		ask it again? Very well. Are you such
		a loser you can't tell when you've
		won?
			(pause)
		The entire state of Texas, along with
		the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
		find you? No. They couldn't. They had
		every entrance to the border covered.
		There's no way you could get across.
		Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
		Seth, enjoy it.

	Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

				SETH
		Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
		me. I insist.

	Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
	in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

				SETH
		To your family.

				JACOB
		To yours.

	They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

				JACOB
		Now, is your shit together?

				SETH
		Forever together.

	Seth turns to Scott.

				SETH
		In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
		it that's yours.

				SCOTT
		Yeah, it's mine.

				SETH
		Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

								  CUT TO:

	Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
	songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
	around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
	song. Everybody applauds.

	Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
	that he uses to announce dancers.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(announcer voice in Spanish)
		And now for your viewing pleasure. The
		Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
		of Evil. The most sinister woman to
		dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
		dogs, get on your knees, bow your
		heads and worship at the feet of
		SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

	The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
	notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

	The crowd hushes up.

	And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

	This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
	Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
	the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

	She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
	stage, but like she owned the world.

	And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
	world is proud to be her possession.

	All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
	Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
	Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
	accompanies from the table with the guitar.

	When the music builds to its explosive section.

	Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
	room.

	She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
	the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
	looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
	and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

	As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
	from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

	Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

	Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
	She STANDS OVER him.

	While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
	bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

	She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
	toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard in Spanish)
		Drink up.

	Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
	CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
	surveys.

	Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

	Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
	this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

	Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
	the beat with his guitar.

	Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
	over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
	Seth and company did to Chet.

	Richard continues to suck her toes.

	The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
	mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
	down at the seated Richard.

	She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
	mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
	OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
	from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
	applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
	and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
	none louder than Seth.

				SETH
		Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
		I call a fuckin' show!

	One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
	which she puts on.

	Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

				SETH
			(snapping his fingers)
		Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
		your new friend to join us?

				RICHARD
		Yeah.

				SETH
		Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

				RICHARD
			(looking up at Santanico)
		Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
		join us?

				SANTANICO
			(to Richard)
		Muy bien, gracias.

	Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

				SETH
		Richie, you lucky bastard!
			(to Santanico)
		Now, little lady, you could of just as
		easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
		You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
		arithmetic.

	The table laughs.

				SETH
		Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
		Riding Hood is walking through the
		forest and she comes across Little Bo
		Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
		"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
		crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
		is walking these woods and if he finds
		you he's gonna pull down your dress
		and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
		Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
		and taps a .357 Magnum she has
		holstered on her thigh and says: "No
		he won't."

	As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
	Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

				JACOB
			(to himself)
		Oh, shit.
			(to Seth)
		Seth --

	Seth waves him away.

				SETH
		Not now. So finally she comes across
		the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
		Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
		Riding Hood, you know better than to
		be walking around these woods alone.
		You know I'm just gonna have to pull
		down your dress and squeeze your
		titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
		whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
		it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
		says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
		me, just like the story says."

	Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
	Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
	anything --

	The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

				RAZOR CHARLIE
			(to Chet in Spanish)
		Which one?

				CHET
			(pointing at Seth)
		This piece of shit broke my finger
		and my nose...
			(pointing at Richard)
		then this fag kicked me in the ribs
		while I was down.

	That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

				BIG EMILIO
			(to The Gecko Brothers)
		Up!

				RICHARD
		Fuck off, ape man!

	Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
	the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
	his wounded shoulder.

	Santanico steps back from the table.

	Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
	Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
	Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
	and SLASHES Seth across the face.

	Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
	his laid open cheek.

	Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
	brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

	Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
	before he hits the floor.

	Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
	out of gunfire.

	The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
	they were doing.

	The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
	dancing.

	Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
	something.

	Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

	Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
	and puts it to his face.

				RICHARD
		How are you?

				SETH
		Scarred for life, that's how I am!

	Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

				SETH
		You thought it was pretty funny,
		didn't you?

	Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
	left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
	the crowd.

				SETH
		Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
		as dead as these fucks!

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

	SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

	The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
	waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

	SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
	to the floor, splattering.

	WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
	her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
	could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

	CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

	Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
	transformation.

	Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
	of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
	her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		Richie, look out!

	Before Richie can turn around.

	SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
	SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

	Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

	Seth turns to his brother's cry.

	He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
	a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
	deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
	about, trying to knock her off.

	Richard screams to Seth:

				RICHARD
		Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

	Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
	can't get a clear shot.

	Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

	Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
	rides him down to the floor.

	Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
	vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

	Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
	half way before he stops, saying:

				RICHARD
			(with his dying breath)
		Fucking Bitch!

	He tumbles over, a corpse.

				SETH
		Richie.

	Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
	Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
	their faces.

	The patrons scream.

	A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
	with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
	and yells:

				WHORE
		Dinner is served!

	The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
	the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
	and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
	turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
	VAMPIRES.

	The vamps attack.

	What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
	sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
	necks.

	Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
	Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
	The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
	monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
	anything.

	Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
	They hide and watch.

	Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
	too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
	motionless, watching what he can't believe.

	Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
	eyes POP OPEN.

	She RISES in her snake/dance way.

	Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

				SANTANICO
		Let's see if you taste as good as your
		brother.

	She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
	CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
	hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

	Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
	JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
	FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

	A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
	side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
	pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

	Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
	switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
	bar to the other.

	The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
	goes head to head with a stripper.

	The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
	close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
	vamp bitch blow for blow.

	Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
	and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
	on the wooden leg.

	FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
	appears, straight razor in hand.

	Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
	Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
	cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
	UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
	Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
	the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

	Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
	vampire's death scream.

	Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
	tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
	chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
	the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
	placed on his chest.

				SANTANICO
		I'm not gonna drain you completely.
		You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
		my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
		eat bugs because I order it. Because
		I don't think you're worthy of human
		blood, you'll feed on the blood of
		stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
		And at my command, you'll lick the dog
		shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
		be my dog, your new name will be
		"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

	SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
		 end over end.

	CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

	looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
	the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

	We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

	Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
	momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

	Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

	Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
	the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

	Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

	Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

				BIG EMILIO
		Noooooo!

	He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

	Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
	see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
	Jacob.

				SETH
		We may be in trouble.

	Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
	walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
	vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
	out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
	him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
	aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

	Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
	Seth and Jacob.

	Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
	weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

	Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
	wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
	look like a huge walking shark.

	Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Hey, you, monkey man!

	Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

				SEX MACHINE
		Anything you gotta say to them, say
		to me first.

	Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
	effortlessly knocks them away.

	They both hit the ground.

	Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
	ahead."

	Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
	locomotive.

	Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
	huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
	Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
	buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
	who HITS the floor.

	Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
	BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
	vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
	savage beating.

				SEX MACHINE
		That's enough.

	Jacob and Seth stop.

	Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
	end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
	big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
	dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
	vamp.

	Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
	breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
	around his mouth.

	Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
	over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
	protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
	trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

				CHET
		You know what everybody says about me?
		I suck!

	Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
	her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
	his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
	off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
	his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
	up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

	GULP.

	Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
	moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
	mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
	jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
	He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
	all the while.

	Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
	their faces.

	Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
	of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

				CHET
		I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

	Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

				CHET
		Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
		pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

	He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
	vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
	staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

	By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
	vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
	customers have been butchered or drained.

	All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
	and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
	kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
	are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
	wooden stakes.

	The four human men group together. The four female vampires
	charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
	Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
	slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
	staked bodies hit the floor.

	Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
	side.

	They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
	taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

				FROST
		Ain't they supposed to burn up or
		something?

	At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
	everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
	the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
	light, which lasts only a split second.

	It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
	that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
	once lay.

	They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
	for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
	useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

	Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
	to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

	He takes his dead hand.

				SETH
		Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
		You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
		find peace there. I love you little
		brother, I'll miss ya bad.

	Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
	POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

				RICHARD
		I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
		love you, too.

	Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
	down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
	He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
	to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
	bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
	from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
	surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
	head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
	wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
	where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
	wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
	whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

				SETH
		Touch my brother with that stake,
		biker, and vampires won't need to
		suck your blood, they'll be able to
		lick it up off the floor.

				SEX MACHINE
		He ain't your brother no more.

				SETH
		That's a matter of opinion, and I
		don't give a fuck about your's.

	Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
	the ground.

				JACOB
		Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

	Seth aims his gun at the group.

				SETH
		Shut up!

	Richard's giggling.

				RICHARD
		Yeah, shut up.

	Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
	out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

				SETH
		Hold him down.

	The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

				SETH
		Richie, here's the peace in death I
		could never give you in life.

	Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
	his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
	heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
	body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
	Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
	He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
	of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
	the bar.

				KATE
		Are you okay?

				SETH
		Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
		world's my oyster, except for the
		fact that I just rammed a wooden
		stake in my brother's heart because
		he turned into a vampire, even
		though I don't believe in vampires.
		Aside from that unfortunate business,
		everything's hunky-dory.

				KATE
		I'm really sorry.

				SETH
		Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
		a chance you'd feed us to them!

				JACOB
		Then why didn't I?

	Jacob walks over to Seth.

				JACOB
		I saved your life. I didn't have to,
		but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
		brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
		sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
		gonna get out of this we need each
		other. And we need you sober and
		thinking, not drunk and...

	As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
	grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
	identify it.

				JACOB
		What the hell is that?

				FROST
		At first I just thought it was birds.

				SEX MACHINE
		No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
		Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
		gnaw.

	Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

				SETH
		It's bats.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
	hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
	inside.


	INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

	Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
	along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
	scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
	do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
	claws poke their way through.

				JACOB
		Give me a hand!

	Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
	the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
	items to help secure and barricade the door.

	As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
	the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
	open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
	activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
	friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
	putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
	POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
	room in her direction.

				SEX MACHINE
		Watch out, girly!

	The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
	scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
	she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
	others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
	Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
	As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
	of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
	vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
	and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
	SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
	the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
	vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
	of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
	heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

	At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
	position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
	ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

				SEX MACHINE
			(mumbling to himself)
		Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

	The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
	Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
	feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
	flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
	SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
	a loop.

	As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
	on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
	stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
	by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
	lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
	raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
	vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
	which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

				SEX MACHINE
		Fire!

	Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		We'll put this out. You stake the rest
		of these fuckers.

				SEX MACHINE
		Way ahead of ya.
			(to Kate)
		What's your name, girly?

				KATE
		Kate, what's yours?

				SEX MACHINE
		Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
		Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
		fuckers.

	Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
	work STAKING the dead bodies.

	Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
	whatever else is at hand.

	A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
	over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
	in front of the window.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		We got a problem!

	Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
	direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
	a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
	SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
	body through the newly formed hole.

	Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
	point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

	The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
	his head back through the hole.

	Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
	when...

	WHAM !

	The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
	cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
	LANDING HARD on his back.

	Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
	of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
	RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
	bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
	its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
	inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

				SETH
		Get this bastard off of me!

	Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
	GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

	Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
	preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
	dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
	body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
	squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
	down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
	Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
	his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
	get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

	Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
	front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
	while, then...

	BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
	fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
	against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
	bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
	cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
	heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
	FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

	Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
	window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
	the bat-thing.

	Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
	exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
	to try and claw their way in.

				JACOB
		Is everybody okay?

	Everyone mutters "yeah."

				JACOB
		Okay, does anybody here know what's
		going on?

				SETH
		Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
		a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
		trying to get inside and suck our
		fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
		simple. And I don't wanna hear any
		bullshit about "I don't believe in
		vampires" because I don't fuckin'
		believe in vampires either. But I do
		believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
		and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
		vampires! Now, does everybody agree
		we're dealin' with vampires.

	Everybody agrees.

				SETH
		You too, preacher?

				JACOB
		I'm like you. I don't believe in
		vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

				SETH
		Good for you. Now, since we all
		believe we're dealing with vampires,
		what do we know about vampires?
		Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
		cross?

				JACOB
		In the Winnebago.

				SETH
		In other words, no.

				SCOTT
		What are you talking about? We got
		crosses all over the place. All you
		gotta do is put two sticks together
		and you got a cross.

				SEX MACHINE
		He's right. Peter Cushing does that
		all the time.

				SETH
		I don't know about that. In order for
		it to have any power, I think it's
		gotta be an official crucifix.

				JACOB
		What's an official cross? Some piece
		of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
		official? If a cross works against
		vampires, it's not the cross itself,
		it's what the cross represents. The
		cross is a symbol of holiness.

				SETH
		Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
		covered, moving right along, what
		else?

				FROST
		Wooden stakes in the heart been
		workin' pretty good so far.

				SEX MACHINE
		Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
		forget, does silver do anything to a
		vampire?

				SCOTT
		That's werewolves.

				SEX MACHINE
		I know silver bullets are werewolves.
		But I'm pretty sure silver has some
		sort of effect on vampires.

				KATE
		Does anybody have any silver?

				ALL
		No.

				KATE
		Then who cares?

				SCOTT
		When's sunrise?

	Jacob looks at his watch.

				JACOB
		About two hours from now.

				KATE
		So all we have to do is get by for a
		few more hours and then we can walk
		right out the front door.

				SEX MACHINE
		Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
		barricades, that door, those plastered
		windows and these walls will last two
		more hours with those bat fucks
		fuckin' with 'em.

				JACOB
		Has anybody here read a real book
		about vampires, or are we just
		remembering what a movie said? I mean
		a real book.

				SEX MACHINE
		You mean like a Time-Life book?

	Everybody laughs.

				FROST
			(in a cowboy voice)
		John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
		shot a man for snorin'.

				JACOB
		I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
		what do we know about these vampires?

				SETH
		Aside from they're thirsty.

				FROST
		Well, one thing, they might got super
		human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

				JACOB
		Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
		Santanico didn't kill her, but it
		didn't feel too good either.

				SEX MACHINE
		Another thing, you try and ram a
		broken chair leg in a human, you
		better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
		The human body is one rough-tough
		machine. But these vamps got soft
		bodies. The texture of their skin is
		softer, mushier. You can push shit
		right through 'em. Conceivably, if
		you hit one hard enough, you could
		take their fuckin' head off.

				SCOTT
		You could take their head off.

				SETH
		Actually, our best weapon against
		these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
			(he points at Jacob)
		He's a preacher.

	Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

				SETH
		As far as God's concerned, we might
		just as well be a piece of fuckin'
		shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
		one problem, his faith ain't what it
		used to be.

	Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
	Jacob stands over him.

				JACOB
		I've had enough of your taunts.

	Seth looks up from the floor.

				SETH
		I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
		faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
		to us. But a man who's a servant of
		God can grab a cross, shove it in
		these monsters' asses. A servant of
		God can bless the tap water and turn
		it into a weapon.

	Seth rises.

				SETH
		I know why you lost your faith. How
		could true holiness exist if your wife
		can be taken away from you and your
		children? Now, I always said God can
		kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
		my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
		ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
		what's out there trying to get in
		here is pure evil straight from hell.
		And if there is a hell, and those
		monsters are from it, there's got to
		be a heaven. Now which are you, a
		faithless preacher or a mean,
		mother fuckin' servant of God?

	Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
	sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

				JACOB
		I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
		God.

	The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
	sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
	It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
	they're in.

				KATE
		I don't know if I can take two hours
		of that noise.

				FROST
		You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
		no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
		hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
		with only the rotting corpses of your
		friends to keep you company?

				JACOB
		What are you talking about?

				FROST
		Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
		behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
		with my entire squad dead. They
		thought they killed everybody, and
		except for me, they were right. But it
		wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
		blew up right next to me, that's why
		I'm so pretty.

	They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
	the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
	possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
	listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
	hour...

	As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
	the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
	can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
	doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
	say:

				MALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
	around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
	hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

				FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
		Thirst.

	We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		Stop fucking saying that!

				TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst!

				SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
		That bite weren't nothin'. It just
		hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
		all. It barely punched the skin.

	Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
	biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
	all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
	many voices, male, female, children saying:

				VOICES (V.O.)
		Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

	Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
	in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
	and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
	actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
	has turned into a vampire.

	The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

				FROST
		...and then when I came back to my
		senses, I realized I had killed the
		entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
		My bayonet had blood and chunks of
		yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
		shish kabob. And to this day I don't
		have the slightest idea how I --

	Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

				SEX MACHINE
		THIRST!

	Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
	into his neck.

	The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

	Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
	pulling.

	Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
	SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

	Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

	Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

	Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
	bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

	Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
	bleeding neck.

				FROST
		I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

	Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
	sack of potatoes.

	He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
	table.

	Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
	leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

				FROST
			(to Sex Machine)
		You're dead, mother fucker! You're
		gonna bite me! You just turned me
		into a vampire, asshole!

				SEX MACHINE
		What are you gonna do about it?

	Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
	straight at Sex Machine.

	Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
	pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

	Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
	loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
	floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
	COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
	hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
	through the air.

	Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

				SETH
		Oh shit!

	Jacob sees.

				JACOB
		Good lord!

	Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
	and CRASHES through it.

	Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
	bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
	hand and runs for the backroom.

	Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
	ground.

	Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
	who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
	back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
	ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
	door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
	as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
	howls and snaps in fury.

	Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
	.45 in its big mouth.

				SETH
		You wanna suck something, suck on
		this!

	He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
	the wall.

	Kate yells:

				KATE
		We have to go back for Daddy!

				SETH
		Daddy's dead.

				KATE
		Noooo!

	She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
	and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
	against the wall.

				SCOTT
		He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
		too far away. If flinging that door
		and filling this room with those
		bat-things would save him, I'd fling
		it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
		into one of them.

				SETH
		He needs our help!

				SCOTT
		He's beyond our help. You saw him get
		bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
		You can't help him. I've got no one
		left to lose but you. I can't be alone
		again. We're sticking together.

	Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


	INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

	Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
	appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
	bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
	restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
	his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
	the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

	The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
	holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
	whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
	in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
	god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
	stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
	in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
	As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
	lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
	candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
	repugnant sight trip him up.

	Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

				JACOB
		Open the door.

	The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
	shut.

	Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
	bloody arm.

	When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

				SETH
		Did he...?

				JACOB
		Yep.

	Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
	over tables and cussing a blue streak.

				SETH
		Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
		vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
		Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

	Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
	creatures on the other side.

				SETH
		You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
		gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
		you godless pieces of shit!

				JACOB
			(to Seth)
		You bet your sweet ass you are, and
		I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
		got much time.

	Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

				KATE
		You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
		daddy?

				JACOB
		No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
		I'm already dead.

	Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
	dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
	kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

				JACOB
			(to his children)
		Children, listen to me. I love you two
		more than anybody. And I just want you 
		to know you've made me proud all your
		lives. But never more so than tonight.
		And I wish we could sit here and cry
		till I pass on, but we can't. Because
		I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
		turn into a monster. And when I do,
		I'm going to be dangerous. But before
		that happens, just know I love you.
			(to Seth and the kids)
		Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
		thirty minutes our friends outside
		will bust in this door. And I'll
		probably turn into a vampire within
		the hour. Now, you have two choices.
		You can wait for me to turn, then deal
		with me, then wait for them to burst
		inside here and the three of you will
		deal with them. Or, we can kick open
		that door and the four of us can hit
		'em with everything we have, and carve
		a path right through 'em to front
		entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
		we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
		them, I scared them, I took them off
		guard. But they're going to get
		unconfused, they're going to get
		unscared, they're going to get
		together and they're going to hit that
		door like a ton of bricks. And when
		that moment arrives, we gotta be
		ready.

	Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
	with boxes and crates.

				JACOB
		What's this stuff?

				SETH
		My guess is that this little dive's
		been feeding on nomad road waifs like
		bikers and truckers for a longtime.
		This is probably some of the
		shipments they stole off the trucks.

				JACOB
		Well, I say lets tear this place apart
		for weapons. So when they burst
		through that door, we'll make 'em wish
		they never did.

				SETH
		I don't give a shit about living or
		dying anymore. I just want to send as
		many of these devils back to hell as
		I can.

				JACOB
		Amen.

	MONTAGE

	The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
	lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
	teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
	doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
	a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
	are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
	balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
	shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

	Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

	Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
	backroom sink.

	Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
	in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

	Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
	getting their courage back.

	Kate makes water balloons.

	Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
	attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

	Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
	turning it into holy water.

	Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
	The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
	begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
	The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
	pounding, squeaking and screaming.

	Finally they're ready.

	Jacob turns to his kids.

				JACOB
		Before we go any further, I need you
		three to promise me something. I'll
		fight with you to the bitter end,
		but when I turn into one of them, I
		won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
		lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
		promise you'll take me down, no
		different from the rest.

	The kids can't say the words.

				SETH
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Kate, Scott?

				KATE
		I promise.

				JACOB
		Scott?

				SCOTT
		Yeah, I promise.

	Jacob doesn't believe them.

				JACOB
		Why don't I believe you?
			(he picks up the .45)
		I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
		want you to swear to God that you'll
		kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
		just kill myself right now. Now,
		since you need me I think you better
		swear. Kate, do you swear to God
		that when I turn into one of the
		undead, you'll kill me?

	Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
	temple.

				JACOB
		Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
		only gonna count to five. One...two...
		three... four...

				KATE
		Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

				JACOB
		Not good enough, swear to God.

				KATE
		I swear to God, our father, that when
		you change into one of the undead, I
		will kill you.

				JACOB
		Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
		less time, so I'm only giving you the
		count of three. One...

				SCOTT
		You don't believe in suicide.

				JACOB
		It's not suicide if you're already
		dead. Two...

				SCOTT
		Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
		I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

				JACOB
		Thank you, son.

				SETH
		Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
		fuckin' vampires.


	INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

	The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
	down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
	the door.

	Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
	and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
	grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
	stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
	the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
	into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

	What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
	Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
	watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
	like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
	starting up the jackhammer.

				SETH
		Kill 'em all!

	Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

	The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
	flesh.

	The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
	forward.

	They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
	the door.

	Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
	in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
	green vamp blood.

	Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
	and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
	other.

	Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

	Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
	toss them into the crowd.

	They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
	in pain.

	From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
	HURLS toward the group.

	Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

	The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

	Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
	the hammer stake into vampire chests.

	The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
	junk.

				SCOTT
			(yelling)
		Why did they block the door again?

				JACOB
			(yelling)
		To keep the daylight out! This is
		where they sleep! Get to the door!

	Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
	half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
	above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
	Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
	off the ground.

	Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
	he CRASHES into a table.

	The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
	sticking out of his chest, dead.

	Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
	screams:

				KATE
		Seth!

	Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
	on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

				SETH
		Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
		and feel all right!

	Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

				KATE
			(yelling)
		I'm going for 'em!

				JACOB
		No!

				KATE
		Everybody goes home!

	Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
	one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
	Seth's direction.

				KATE
			(screaming)
		Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

	Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
	burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
	couple of water balloons and a stake.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Watch my back!

				SETH
		Anytime.

	Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
	bar.

	Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
	fiery death.

	Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

	As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
	can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
	to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
	vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
	happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
	His eyes are yellow.

	Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

	Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
	sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
	murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

	Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
	SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

	The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
	of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

	Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
	up to fire.

	A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
	with the boy he once called his son.

	Scott's eyes turn to steel.

				SCOTT
		I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
		name.

	He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
	creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
	head bursts into flames, then explodes.

	From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
	cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

				SETH
		Fight now, cry later.

	Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
	with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

	A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
	it bites into him. He drops the .45.

	Kate sees Scott get bit.

				KATE
		Oh my god.

	Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
	Scott screams.

				KATE
		You bastards!

	She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

	Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
	Scott is in agony.

				SCOTT
		Kill me, Kate! 

	Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
	up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
	times.

	One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
	all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

	The remaining vamps approach.

	All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
	balloon.

				SETH
		How many bullets left, kid?

				KATE
		Not many.

				SETH
		Well, when you run out of weapons,
		just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
		sing for their supper.

	The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
	things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
	throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
	bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

	The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
	them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
	holding the .45, arm outstretched.

				KATE
			(to Seth)
		Should I use the last bullets on us?

				SETH
		You use 'em on the first couple of
		these parasites that try to bite you.

	The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
	on the face of an approaching vampire.

	Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
	vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

	Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
	through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
	vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

				SETH
		Shoot more holes!

	Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
	behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
	Seth with a safe, lighted area.

	The .45's empty.

	The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
	able to get at them.

	The two survivors hold hands, when...

	All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
	from the outside.

	The vamps look towards it in horror.

	From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
	Spanish accent.

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
		there?

				SETH
			(yelling)
		Carlos!
			(in Spanish)
		Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
		in!

				CARLOS (O.S.)
			(in Spanish)
		Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
		Hurry, hurry!

	The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
	around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
	each other.

	The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
	the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
	door.

	The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

	The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
	are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

	The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
	MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
	in fright.

	Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
	hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
	hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
	Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
	combust in fiery explosions.

	The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

	Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
	door into the parking lot.


	EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

	Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
	them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
	Carlos's Mercedes.

				CARLOS
			(to Seth)
		What the fuck was going on in there?

	Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
	breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
	kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

				CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

				SETH
		Why the fuck, outta all the god
		forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
		have us rendezvous at that place?

				CARLOS
		I don't know, one place's as good as
		another.

				SETH
		Have you ever been there before?

				CARLOS
		No, but I passed by it a couple of
		times. It's out in the middle of
		nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
		so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
		And it's open from dusk till dawn.
		You said meet you in the morning.

				SETH
		Well, because you picked that place
		out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
		And this girl's family's dead.

	Carlos stands up again.

				CARLOS
		I'm sorry to hear that. What were
		they, psychos?

				SETH
		Did they look like psychos? They
		were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
		explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
		don't care how crazy they are.

	Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
	themselves again.

				CARLOS
		Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
		to you?

				SETH
		You can't, but fifteen percent instead
		of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
		good start.

				CARLOS
		Twenty-eight.

				SETH
		Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
		dead and he's not coming back, and
		it's all your fault. Twenty.


	They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

				SETH AND CARLOS
			(in Spanish)
		Twenty-five.

	Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
	to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


				CARLOS
		You like the car?

				SETH
		I said new, this is an '90.

				CARLOS
		It's hardly been used at all. I got it
		from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
		times in as many years. Swear to God.
		That's like new.

				SETH
		So do I just follow you?

				CARLOS
		Yeah, follow us.


				SETH
		So let's do it.

				CARLOS
			(to Danny and Manny)
		Vamanos!

	Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

	Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

	Kate stands alone.

	The whole desert seems between them.

	So much to say ... but no words.

				SETH
		I'm sorry.

				KATE
		Me too.

	Long pause.

				SETH
		See ya.

				KATE
		Later.

	Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
	says behind him:

				KATE (O.S.)
		Seth.

	Seth turns around.

				KATE
		You want some company?

	Seth smiles.

				SETH
		Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
		I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

	He blows her a kiss across the desert.

	She blows one back.

	Seth's in his car and GONE.

	Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
	begins her long walk home.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT

	CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

	Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

	EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT

	Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
	in tuxedo moves into:

	INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

	THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
	to the ballroom.

	ANGLE - COAT CHECK

	The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
	AID FOUNDATION"

	Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.

				ROBERTS (V.O.)
		Richard...

	DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
	of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

				ROBERTS
		Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
		into it...

	A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

				KIMBLE 
		So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
		buys ten new -

				NAT
		No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
		Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
		has no ulterior motives.

				KIMBLE 
		On the house, huh?
			(to bartender)
		Tonic water with lime.

	Everyone agrees.

				KIMBLE 
		Never get me to sell my soul for one
		of those trips...

	His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

				KIMBLE
			(to Nat)
	 	... But if you get any more Bulls 
		tickets, Nat, give me a call.

	The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS
	CONTINUE OVER -

	KIMBLE

	Moving through the crowd.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary 
	golf swing.

				KIMBLE 
		You're slicing, Dave. Don't turn 
		your hip.

	He keeps moving.

				GOLFING MAN 
		Thanks, Richard...

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT

	KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
	elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
	T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

				DR. WAHLUND 
			(dripping sarcasm)
		I'm so glad you talked me into 
		coming, Richard... I can pick my
		cruise wardrobe.

				RICHARD 
		It's for a good cause, Kath... 
		Besides you need to get out of the
		lab more. Your electron microscope
		is starting to give you a tan.

	She smiles. He moves on.

	ANGLE - PARTY

	Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

				KIMBLE
		Hey, Jim.

	DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
	University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I just saw someone who 
		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
	a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
	catch a look and hold it.

				NICHOLS (V.O.)
		Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
		is working on the RDU90 trials for 
		Devlin-Macgregor.

	Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
	smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

				LENTZ
		Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
		trading phone calls last few days 
		... something about a biopsy report 
		I returned to you?

				KIMBLE
			(suddenly attentive)
		Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
		hepatetic to me.

				LENTZ
		I'll be in my office in the morning 
		and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
		a good time for you?

				KIMBLE
		Sure.

				LENTZ
			(holds Kimble's look, 
			then to Nichols)
		See you, Jim.

	Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
	on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
	Nichols move together through the party.

				NICHOLS
			(digs in his pocket)
		Before I forget, I went by the garage
		this afternoon and picket up the 
		Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

	He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

				KIMBLE
		They fix it this time?

				NICHOLS
		We'll see.

	They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
	Kimble kisses her.

				NICHOLS
		You look fabulous, Helen.

	He kisses Helen.

				HELEN (WOMAN)
		Hello, Jim.

				NICHOLS
			(to Kimble)
		We've got a court tomorrow at three.

	Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

				KIMBLE
		Well, I've seen everyone, can we 
		leave?

				HELEN
		That would be a little abrupt, don't 
		you think?

	CUT TO:

	ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

	A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
	others at table ant sit across from each other.

	Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
	mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
	OLDER WIFE.

	Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
	CONTINUE...

	INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.

				NOW EAU WIFE
			(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going 
		to kill us if he didn't stop 
		operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
		he's putting us all at risk.

	Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

				HELEN
			(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
		home.

	They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
	shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
	see Lentz watching.

	INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
	his hair as he drives.

				HELEN
		You looked handsome tonight...

				KIMBLE
		Thank you...

	He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
	for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

				HELEN
		Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
		like waiters...

				KIMBLE
		But me?

				HELEN
		You looked more like... a band 
		director.

	He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
	changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

				HELEN
		Are we home yet?...

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his 
	PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.

				KIMBLE
			(to phone)
		Dr. Kimble
			(suddenly attentive)
		When? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
		in ten minutes.

	He hangs up.

				KIMBLE
		Tim's got a problem.

	Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

				HELEN
		Call me on your way home.

	CREDITS END as we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down 
	stairs to the OR hall.

	He sticks his head into the operating room.

				KIMBLE
		Cavalry's here.

	Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

	SCRUB ROOM

	Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
	him up to speed.

				RESIDENT
		Patient is a male, forty-three. We 
		pulled his gall bladder and the 
		bleeding started.

				KIMBLE
		What's his pro time?

				RESIDENT
			(concerned)
		He's at 36 seconds. We got a major 
		bleeder in here.

				KIMBLE
		You talk to the family?

				RESIDENT
		None. He's off the street.

	CUT TO:


	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

	Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
	trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
	is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
	working so intently they never look at each other as they 
	talk...

				KIMBLE
			(to Anesthesiologist)
		Okay... I'm clamping. Can he 
		tolerate it?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		He's a very sick guy.

				KIMBLE
		Do we have a choice?

				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
		Go for it.

				KIMBLE
		Marie, give me a clamp...

	MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
	and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
	assisting.

				KIMBLE
			(never looking up)
		Your husband know you're here tonight,
		Marie?... What about this liver?

				RESIDENT
		History's sketchy. Could be an 
		alcoholic.

				KIMBLE
		Who referred him?

				RESIDENT
		He's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

	Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
	over their masks, then back to work.

				KIMBLE
		The wave of the future... Marie, you 
		told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
		of this late night thing we've got 
		going here... This should hold him. 
		Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a 
		biopsy...
			(to circulating nurse)
		Send it downstairs and make sure you 
		get Kath her slice.

				SURGEON
		You staying for the closing, Rich?

	Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

				KIMBLE
		No. I got a date.

	INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind 
	him; it is the other Surgeon.

				SURGEON
		Hey, Richard...

	Kimble turns.

				SURGEON
		Thanks.

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. 
	He is on phone, waits for answer.

				KIMBLE
		Hi. I'm five minutes away...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with 
	an afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading.

				HELEN
		I'm glad it went well. I'll see you 
		in a minute.

	Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the 
	stairs.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT

	Kimble driving.

	INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

	Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

	Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
	the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
	one of the interior closet doors.

	She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

	A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
	claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
	string of pearls bursts...

	... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
	across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
	the top.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the 
	driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still 
	on.

	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
	the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
	calls up the stairs.

				KIMBLE
		I'm home. Did you hear who won the 
		Bulls game?

	No answer. He steps into the:

	KITCHEN

	The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The 
	WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,
	and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two 
	glassesand leaves the kitchen.

	INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT

	Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of 
	phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the 
	gun.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS - STAIRS - NIGHT

	Kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Helen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

	ON KIMBLE

	Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

	A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks 
	it up... a pearl.

				KIMBLE
		Helen?

	Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
	Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

	UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

	Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
	Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
	face...

	The SIRENS are LOUDER...

	Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
	down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

	Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
	by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

				HELEN (O.S.)
		He's here... still in the house...

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one 
	hand, her head with the other.

				911 (V.O.)
		Did I hear you right? Your attacker 
		is still in the house? Ma'am?

				HELEN
		He's trying to kill me...

	Kimble appears. Helen drops the phone when she sees him.

				911 (V.O.)
		Will you repeat that please?

				HELEN
			(to Kimble)
		Richard... He's trying to kill me... 
		my head.


	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	Two Chicago police cars wheel to the curb, COPS move quickly 
	to the house.

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
	was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
	leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

				KIMBLE
		Hang on, babe... going to be all 
		right.

	Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

				HELEN
		My head. Richard my hold me.

	Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
	head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
	she won't be all right.

	CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

				911 (V.O.)
		... Hello. You said his name is 
		Richard? Ma'am, can you talk to me? 
		Ma'am?

	CUT TO:

	in the kitchen sink. A cop takes his blood-stained tux 
	jacket, and another hands him a parka.

	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

	The street is filled with Chicago police cars, curious 
	neighbors, television news vans, etc.

	Kimble is helped into a police car as the coroner's van 
	arrives. He pauses a moment to watch as we hear.

				DETECTIVE KELLY (V.O.)
		Can you give us a little more to go 
		on besides the fact that he had an 
		artificial arm? What kind of gun was
		it, Doc?

	INT. 11TH STREET DISTRICT HOUSE - NIGHT

	CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
	shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
	KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
	aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

				KIMBLE
		It was .38... I think. I only saw it 
		for a second. I knocked it out of 
		his hand.

	As Kimble is questioned we INTERCUT WITH flashes of the 
	murder scene being processed:

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble looks up at the two cops. For the first time he seems 
	to sense something aggressive in their questioning.

	They no longer seem on the same team.

				KIMBLE
		What's going on here? This guy was 
		trying to rob us.

	The two cops stare at Kimble.

				KIMBLE
		You guys have got to be out of your 
		minds. I didn't kill my wife!

	He gets up to go. A cop blocks his path. He turns and looks

		... We can't find this guy.

				KIMBLE
		I know what I saw, Walter.

				GUTHERIE
		I put you up on the stand to say what 
		you saw without anything that 
		remotely smells like proof and the 
		State's attorney is going to take 
		this one-armed man story and run it 
		up our ass.
			(he holds Kimble's look)
		Look, Richard, you're paying us a 
		lot of money to defend you... A plea
		to second degree -

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

	INT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - DAY

	Kimble being escorted back to the courtroom. A guard carries 
	his suit in a bag. He is taunted by other prisoners.

				GUTHERIE (V.O.)
		You're a successful upper middle 
		class white man charged in a 
		violent crime...

	INT. COOK COUNTY LOCKUP / CHANGE ROOM - DAY

	On the other side of the door is the courtroom. A sheriff's 
	deputy hands Kimble (now wearing his suit), a small plastic 
	bag. In it we see his wedding band.

				GUTHERIE (V.O.)
		It's a circumstantial case, but it's 
		also a jury trial. We play 'em, they 
		play 'em...

	INT. CHICAGO COURTROOM - DAY

	Richard Kimble sits at defense table... watches prosecutors 
	chat with Helen's relatives. Media anchors glare at him.

				GUTHERIE (V.O.)
		... But if we lose, we lose big. 
		Just remember, they're lined up a 
		block long to have your hide.

	HARD CUT TO:

	PHOTOGRAPH OF HELEN KIMBLE'S BODY

	A crime scene photograph.

	DETECTIVE KELLY

	On the stand.

				DETECTIVE KELLY
		No forcible entry was found. From

		it did not appear to be a break-in. 
		Nothing was missing.

	FORENSICS TECHNICIAN

	On the stand.

				FORENSICS TECHNICIAN
		The defendant's prints were found on

	FACES OF THE JURY

	Impassive. Attentive. His "peers." They listen to the 
	recording of the 911 tape.

				911 (V.O.)
		Did I hear you right? Your attacker 
		is still in the house? Ma'am?

				HELEN (V.O.)
		He's trving to kill me...

				911 (V.O.)
		Will you repeat that please?

				HELEN (V.O.)
		Richard... He's trying to kill me...

	KIBLE'S POV - THE JURY

	A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
	out of context.

	NICHOLS ON THE STAND

				PROSECUTOR
		Dr. Nichols. You are aware that 
		Richard Kimble was the only 
		beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
		12 million dollars roughly.

				NICHOLS
		I was aware of that. The money meant 
		nothing to him.

				PROSECUTOR
		Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
		once said that 'if he had Helen's 
		money he could find plenty of uses.'
		Did he not?

				NICHOLS
		We were talking about -

				PROSECUTOR
		Yes or no?

	Nichols' look tells us everything... Yes.

	CUT TO:

	CORONER

	On the stand.

				CORONER
		The wound to the head caused a 
		massive hemorrhage to the brain. It 
		took from five to seven minutes for 
		her to die...

	A woman in the jury reacts. Kimble notices.

	KIMBLE

	On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the 
	events. We see some of the jury has been moved.

				KIMBLE
		... And I was holding her when the 
		officers came in.

	Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
	jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

				PROSECUTOR
		How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

				KIMBLE
		I can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
		the floor, fighting... I couldn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Did that fight cause the scratches 
		on your face and arms?

				KIMBLE
		No. As I explained -

				PROSECUTOR
		And how did this man enter your 
		house?

				KIMBLE
		I don't know -

				PROSECUTOR
		And you probably don't know why your 
		wife told the emergency operator You 
		were her attacker?

				KIMBLE
		She didn't -

				PROSECUTOR
		Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your 
		gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints 
		were on the gun, the bullets, the 
		lamp, her neck, weren't they?

				KIMBLE
		Look...

				PROSECUTOR
		Weren't they?

	CUT TO:

	INT. COURTROOM - DAY

	Richard Kimble sits behind the desk, but already he's a 
	shadow of the man we knew before, stares ahead passively as 
	Judge Bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom.

				JUDGE BENNETT
		After careful and studied review of 
		all evidence presented during each 
		phase of this proceeding, and 
		because aggravated circumstances, 
		detailed at length, were present 
		the night of January 20th.

	Kimble is silent, stunned, but all around him the sentence 
	shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
	doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
	satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
	lowers his head. Disbelief.

	ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

	He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by 
	bailiff. Gutherie whispers an "I'm sorry." Kimble doesn't 
	hear it.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		Therefore, it is the decision of 
		this court...

	Looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom. Faces 
	stare back.

	CUT TO:

	INT. KIT ROOM - DAY

	Judge Bennett's V.O. CONTINUES over:

	A locker opening. Inside, a profusion of chrome and nickel 
	plating. Jailhouse jewelry. Handcuffs dragged out. Action 
	checked.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		... that you be remanded to Menard 
		State penitentiary...

	CLOSE ON CUFFS

	Slapped down over wrists, ratcheting down tight.

	Ankle cuffs dragged out. Pant legs raised, canvas shoes 
	exposed. Cuffs clamped down on ankles.

	CHAINS RATTLED out. Snaked across the floor. Looped around 
	waists and locked to handcuffs to form belly chains.

				JUDGE BENNETT (V.O.)
		... where you will serve a sentence 
		of life imprisonment without 
		possibility of parole.

	EXT . SALLY PORT (COOK COW TY JAIL) - NIGHT

	The chain gang exits through the sally port. Kimble and 
	three other prisoners. Jailers escort them to...

	An Illinois Department of Corrections guard moves alongside,
	checking the undercarriage with a pole-mounted mirror.

	The GAVEL CRACKS as we -

	CUT TO:

	INT. BUS - CLOSE ON KEY - DAY

	Locking wire mesh cage inside bus.

	An old DIESEL COUGHS to life.

	EXT. COOK COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

	Main gates open. The BUS GRINDS onto the streets.

	INT. BUS - DAY

	The four prisoners sit scattered, still cuffed but no longer 
	chained together. Near the front, PRISONER #1 is eyeing...

	The two prison guards seated beyond the caged door. YOUNG 
	GUARD lighting a smoke. OLD GUARD drowsing. Shotguns 
	bouncing on their knees. Prisoner #l shifts his gaze to...

	The driver. Pistol on his hip.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	The BUS RUMBLES north, heading towards the horizon.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	PRISONER #1 rises. Through caging:

				PRISONER #1
		Hey. Illinois penal regulations 
		require a meal for transport
		rides of four hours or more.

	Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
	Checks his watch: 4:00.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Jack! Feedin' time.

	Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
	belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

	PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
	the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
	aisle...

	PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
	between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
	CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
	plastic shank.

	Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
	handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
	a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

				COPELAND
		Breathe, and you're first.

	Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
	carelessly ready.

	Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
	doesn't respond.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Suit yourself.

	He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
	sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

	Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

				KIMBLE
		Look out!

	Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
	Young Guard's gut.

	Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
	out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

	Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
	floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
	inside, but...

	Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
	Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
	the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

	The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing
	prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

	Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS 
	ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

	Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the 
	Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
	off target as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
	and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
	bottom of a small ravine.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

	On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
	him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
	at...

	Kimble. Rising between the seats.

	A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
	off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

	Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
	find Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
			(to Kimble)
		You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

	He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
	medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

				OLD GUARD
		Do something.

	Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
	his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
	Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
	Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

				KIMBLE
		He isn't going to make it unless he 
		gets to a hospital. Fast.

				OLD GUARD
		ZL.

	In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
	just settling?

	With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
	Guard's bleeding.

	ANGLE UNDER SEAT

	We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
	back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
	opening.

	BACK TO KIMBLE

	A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
	retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
	growing vibration.

				KIMBLE
		Just where the hell are we?

	The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
	looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

				OLD GUARD
		Oh, shit...


	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
	grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges 
	to his side.

				KIMBLE
		It's locked. Where're your keys?

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
	Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
	the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

	The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
	snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

				KIMBLE
		Which one? This? This one?!

	Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
	the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

				KIMBLE
		Help me get him -

	But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
	the shattered windshield.

	ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

	Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

	EXT. BUS - NIGHT

	... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
	locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
	Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
	hold a look.

	EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

	As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
	behind him. He slings the man clear.

	SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

	For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

	The train light X-rays him.

	Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
	away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
	dozen mincing steps before...

	IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
	splitting it open.

	Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
	feet, still running feverish half-steps.

	An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
	flanks.

	The train burns past the wounded Guard.

	Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
	him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

	Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
	after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
	chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
	of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
	nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
	something in his hand.

	It's the key-ring.

	EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
	Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		Give me that.

	Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
	own chains.

				COPELAND
		You listen to me. I don't give a 
		damn which way you go, just don't 
		follow me.

	Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
	arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
	other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

	News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
	smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
	hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
	feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
	wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
	investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
	remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

	Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
	marshals emerge:

	BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
	shithouse.

	RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
	fully-equipped.

	POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during 
	nut-cuttin' time.

	NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

	From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media 
	spectacle.

				GERARD
		Good lord...

				REFRO
		What is this... a circus?

	As a group they begin moving along the service road above 
	the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
	them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
	walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

	Biggs spots something...

				BIGGS
		Point of impact.

	... and branches off.

				GERARD
		Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.

				BIGGS
		Shit.
			(to Newman)
		Come on.

	They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain 
	with Gerard.

	A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
	sees Gerard's Marshall star.

				GERARD
		How ya doing? Who's in charge?

				TROOPER
		Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the 
		lights -

	Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
	scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

	Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
	about to happen.

	ANGLE - OLD GUARD

	Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
	shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
	SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
	news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
	b.g., listening.

				OLD GUARD
		... train was bearin' down on us, 
		fast. I don't know how - it's still 
		kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
		and pushed him out of the bus.

				SHERIFF
		You coulda both been killed.

				OLD GUARD
		I know, but hell, he's my partner.
		Woulda done the same for me.

	The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
	eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

				GERARD
		Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
		U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

				SHERIFF
			(annoyed)
		I'll be with you in a minute.

	The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
	his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
	of all four prisoners.

				SHERIFF
			(to Old Guard)
		For the record. These three dead. 
		And this one...

	He switches to a photo of Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
		Well, everything happened so fast...
			(bites lip, decides)
		Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

	Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
	prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

				SHERIFF
		You get some rest.

	He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

				SHERIFF
		Looks like you came a long way for 
		nothing. My men've already done a 
		thorough search from point of 
		impact and found nothing.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	ANGLE - CULVERT

	Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
	something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

	GERARD

	Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

				GERARD
		With all due respect, may I suggest 
		check-points starting at a 15-mile 
		radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
		of -

				SHERIFF
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
		Prisoners are all dead. The only 
		thing check-points will do is get a 
		lot of good people out here frantic 
		and flood my office with calls.

	Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
	we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

				GERARD
			(beat)
		Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
		that to happen... So, I'll be 
		taking over the investigation.

				SHERIFF
		On whose authority?

				GERARD
		By authority of the Governor of the 
		State of Illinois and the office of
		the United States Marshal, 5th 
		District Northern Illinois...

	Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
	from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

				SHERIFF
			(back-down beat)
		Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
		this mess, you got it.
			(to assistants)
		Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
		mop up for us.

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

				GERARD
		Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
		back and give this poor man some 
		room.

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
	change of story and command.

	Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
	Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

				GERARD
			(friendly, to Old 
			Guard)
		Always an interesting thing when we 
		find leg irons and no legs in them 
		who held the keys, sir?

				OLD GUARD
		Uh, me.

				GERARD
		Would you be so kind as to show them
		to me, sir?

	Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

	The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
	press hovering just out of earshot.

				GERARD
		Second chance.

	Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

	The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

				OLD GUARD
			(cracking)
		He mighta got out.

				GERARD
		Thank you.

				SHERIFF
		What the hell is this? A minute ago 
		you tell me he's part of the 
		wreckage, now you're -

				GERARD
		Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
		an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
		up operations right here.

	He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
	downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
	Israelites behind Moses.

				GERARD
		Ladies and gentlemen... our 
		fugitive's been on the run for 
		ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
		over uneven ground - barring injury 
		is approximately four miles an hour, 
		giving us a radius of six miles. I 
		want a hard-target search of any 
		residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
		henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
		that area. Check-points go up at 
		15 miles.
			(to media)
		You got that? Good. Now, turn 
		those damn things off and get out 
		of our way.

	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
	dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

	EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

	Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
	The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
	later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

	EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
	blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
	going to need stitches.

	Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
	moving.

	EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

	Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
	of the lights.

	A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
	road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
	mile.

	ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

	Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
	nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
	He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
	jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
	breath.

	Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
	the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
	cover behind the wrecked car.

	The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
	seat and closes the door.

	He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
	something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
	and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
	coveralls missing from the seat.

	As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
	side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
	clutching the coveralls.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

	A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
	crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
	lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
	tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

	Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
	relays it to Gerard.

				POOLE
		Blood trail found. Two miles 
		southwest.

				GERARD
			(to Biggs)
		Type it and match it against all 
		four prisoners.
			(to Renfro)
		Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
		every local hospital.
			(to Newman)
		Newman...

	Newman appears.

				NEWMAN
		Yes, sir...

				GERARD
		I need some coffee.

	As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
	from the train crash.

	ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

	A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

				WORKER
		Hey, one's alive!

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

	Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food 
	outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck 
	operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
	Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

	A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a 
	bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.
	Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front 
	of the doorway.

	KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble closes the door and locks it. Hanging on the back of

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

	An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.

	CUT TO:

	CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY

	On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened 
	antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty 
	syringe. We PULL BACK to find:

	KIMBLE

	His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches 
	already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as 
	he sutures himself.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING

	At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a 
	DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROCEDURE'S ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot 
	of antibiotics.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY

	A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes 
	closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

	KIMBLE
	Can you hear me, sir?

	No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the 
	patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his 
	clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched 
	breakfast tray.

	CUT TO:

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - NURSES' DUTY STATION - DAY

	The Duty Nurse and State Trooper chat when a fax begins 
	coming through on DESK FAX.

				NURSE
		There's your fax...

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble dressing in the man's clothes. He eats a piece of 
	toast - part of the man's breakfast - as he buttons up his 
	shirt.

	ANGLE - PATIENT

	His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call 
	button.

	CUT TO:

	INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

	A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the 
	duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the 
	patient's call light comes on.

	The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the 
	patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the 
	patient's room.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the 
	patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

				DUTY NURSE (O.S.)
		Mr. Patterson, do you need some more 
		water?

	ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

	The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

				DUTY NURSE
		... Oh, you did a good job on this.

	She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

	... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and 
	refills the pitcher from the sink.

				DUTY NURSE
			(over her shoulder, 
			to patient)
		... It does get dry in here, doesn't 
		it?

	She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes 
	into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind 
	it.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and 
	a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency 
	room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the 
	E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
	down the corridor toward Kimble.

	The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

				TROOPER
		'Scuse me, Doc?...

	Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
	doors behind him.

				TROOPER
		... Don't know if you heard or not 
		but we're looking for an escaped 
		prisoner from that bus train wreck 
		'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
		show up here if he was hurt.

				KIMBLE
		What's he look like?

	The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
	trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
	Kimble's cheek.

				TROOPER
			(from fax sheet)
		Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
		brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

	At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
	it clean as the Trooper looks up.

				TROOPER
		... Seen anyone that fits that 
		description?

				KIMBLE
		Every time I look in the mirror ...
		but without the beard.

	They laugh.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me...

				TROOPER
		Sure.

	Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks 
	outside...

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

	Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The 
	lead wheels are stuck.

				KIMBLE
		Here...

	Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney 
	comes free.

				PARAMEDIC #2
		Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out 
		from under a train.

	As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
	of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

				YOUNG GUARD
		It's him... It's -

	Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
	Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

				KIMBLE
		How is he?

	The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

				PARAMEDIC #1
		He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, 
		ribs. Concussion.

	As Kimble moves away...

				KIMBLE
		Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got 
		a perforated spleen.

	He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk 
	the Young Guard inside.

				PARAMEDIC #2
			(impressed)
		Jesus, how could he tell that from 
		looking at his face?

	ANGLE - AMBULANCE

	Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

	EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	A full communications link is in place.

	Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information 
	to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole 
	calls Gerard.

				POOLE
		Background just came in from 
		Chicago.

				GERARD
		Hit me.

	Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of 
	information comes clear and fast.

				RENFRO
		Richard David Kimble. Vascular 
		Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree 
		murder in the killing of his wife. 
		Pleaded innocent. Claimed a 
		one-armed -

				GERARD
		Let's not retry the case. Priors
		and accomplices?

	Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the 
	investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

				RENFRO
		None. No previous arrests.

	Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard 
	unzips his fly and relieves himself.

				GERARD
		Sealed juvie record?

	Poole calls out from behind tree.

				POOLE
		Nothing. Total cherry.

				GERARD
		Relatives? Children?

				RENFRO
		No relatives.

				POOLE
		One child. A son. Died in drowning 
		accident three years ago.

				GERARD
		Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? 
		Combinations of the above?

				POOLE
		Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital 
		staff.

	Gerard zips up.

				GERARD
		Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
		his lawyer first.

				RENFRO
		Never get it.

				GERARD
		Bet me.

	Renfro won't take it.

				GERARD
		Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, 
		he'll sign 'em.

	... Biggs charges up the hillside.

				BIGGS
		DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard 
		swears to High Holy he saw Kimble 
		right there in the hallway. 
		Ambulance, missing too.

	ANGLE - SITUATION TENT

	Gerard moves quickly to the map.

				GERARD
		Give me a time.

				BIGGS
		O-nine-thirty. Twenty minutes ago.

	Gerard redraws the circle of units. No longer are we 
	covering a fifty-mile radius. The circle is redrawn, 
	tightened, with the hospital as its center. The 
	triangulation is set.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. RURAL RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

	The ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad 
	crossing.

				COP (V.O.)
		... We're waiting up here in Canton.
		Wondering if you heard anything on 
		this Kimble chase -

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad 
	crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		Two-twelve-A, be advised that all 
		discussion on this matter is to be 
		conducted on a tactical frequency 
		- either Channel K or Z. Over.

	Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

	ROAD SIGN

	An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

	The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal 
	suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops 
	the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and 
	heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets 
	attention.

	INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

	Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and 
	reaches for his C.B. radio.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

	Poole hangs up phone.

				POOLE
		Ambulance just spotted two miles 
		west of Doverville. Heading north 
		on State road 53.

	Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much 
	smaller.

				RENFRO
		Running outta map, Sam.

	The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is 
	ready to move.

				GERARD
		Just the way we want it. Okay, 
		people, let's button up.

	They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and 
	eyeballs folded roadmap...

	EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the 
	Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.

	EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and 
	G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of 
	Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS 
	overhead.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. 
	Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

				PILOT
			(into radio)
		We've got a visual...
			(to Gerard)
		He's heading toward the viaduct.

				GERARD
		Seal it up.

	EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

	The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred 
	feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

	The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into 
	the tunnel.

	ON KIMBLE

	Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at 
	the mouth of the tunnel.

	Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

	ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

	Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far 
	entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

	ANGLE HELICOPTER

	Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

	KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

	Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. 
	Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

	EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking 
	the other end.

	Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a 
	State patrol car blares:

				P.A. (V.O.)
		Please remain in your vehicles and 
		lock your doors. Repeat, please 
		remain in -

	ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

	Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. 
	They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a 
	vest.

				RENFRO
		Got him.

	Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

				GERARD
		Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard 
		part's over.

	He starts into the tunnel.

				RENFRO
			(to radio)
		We're movin' in.

	INT. TUNNEL - DAY

	Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three 
	silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' 
	P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb 
	back inside and lock their doors.

	Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
	middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

	Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
	ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
	clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

	Running water.

	ON MARSHALS

	They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks 
	around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks 
	confused.

				POOLE
		Where'd he go?

	Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until 
	he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

				GERARD
		Biggs, Renfro with me.

	INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows 
	at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. 
	A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
	off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
	straight ahead.

	Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
	wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
	to...

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
	forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

				GERARD
		Channel Three.

	They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go 
	left. Gerard - straight ahead.

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy 
	downslope.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances. 
	Searching for splash-patterns.

				BIGGS
			(into shoulder-mike)
		Nothing yet.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to 
	pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the 
	branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Got a possible here. Stand by.

	He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with 
	three limbs

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
	Slips again...

	... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

	Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
	Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
	lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
	there first.

	It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
	flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

				GERARD
		So, you didn't kill your wife.

	Not my problem.

	An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
	silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

				BIGGS (V.O.)
		Gerard? You there?

	Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

	Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
	piece.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro 
	appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

				GERARD
		Straight ahead!

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
	in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
	lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
	incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
	stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam 
	disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of 
	mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

	He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

	ANGLE - MARSHALS

	Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a 
	shooting stance.

				GERARD
		Turn around, hands over your head. 
		And get down on the ground.

	For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

				GERARD
		Your choice, Kimble...

	Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
	water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
	up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
	water toward Kimble.

				GERARD
		Get down on your knees.

	Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
	footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

	Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
	into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
	the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

	INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

	Renfro lowers his gun.

				RENFRO
			(amazed)
		Son of a bitch...

	It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

	ON GERARD

	He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
	stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
	something invaluable about this fugitive.

	EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

	Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
	near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
	helicopter converge on the site.

	EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

	Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

	The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
	stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

	Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
	shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

	Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

	FROM SHORE

	Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
	the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
	ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Running out of daylight, Inspector.

				GERARD
		Lights and generators are coming, 
		Captain.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
		job, but maybe one person in a 
		million could've survived that fall.
		The guy's fish food.

	Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

				GERARD
		Then find me the fish that ate him.

	He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

	EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

	Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
	sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
	exhausted.

	KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

	ANGLE

	Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
	her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO 
	FRAME and kisses her.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	ANGLE

	Helen tosses her head back. She wears white silk pajamas 
	and smiles down AT us. A hand reaches up and unbuttons the 
	top two buttons of her top. Then Kimble moves up INTO FRAME 
	as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEACH - DAY

	Helen running down beach TOWARD us. Embraces Kimble as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POOL - DAY

	Helen's head comes up out of a pool. Hair tossed back, she 
	smiles as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder. She 
	looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles.

				HELEN
		Good-bye. I love you.

	Again... Then again... then:

	HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. FOREST - MORNING

	Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
	remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

	EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING

	Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
	tunnel.

	INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

	Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
	party 
	to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

	Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

	ANGLE - PHONE

	Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
	RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
		and Wainwright.

				KIMBLE
		Walter Gutherie please.

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
		for the day, would you like his 
		voice mail?

	Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
	of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
	shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
	sees the pharmacist looking at him.

	EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
	new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
	moves down the road to the diner.

	INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
	WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
	tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need to look at the menu?

				KIMBLE
		Some soup, please.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Good choice.

	She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
	Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

	A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
	stares at him.

	A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
	away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
	he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

	Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
	his soup. Where's the first waitress?

	Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
	sees:

	The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
	going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

	A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

	ANGLE - TV

	A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
	chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
	from the fall.

	Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
	the counter and exits.

	EXT. DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
	he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
	the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

	Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
	sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
	hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
	faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
	a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
	inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
	chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
	looks at himself. He's shaking.

	A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
	to him, passenger window rolls down...

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need a ride?

	Kimble stares at her.

				KIMBLE
		Which way are you going?

	She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
	They hold a look as we hear:

				RENFRO (V.O.)
		We feel confident about the I.D.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

	A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
	woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
	down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
	early morning traffic.

	We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
	street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
	that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
	woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
	radio.

				RENFRO
		Local officials were about to wet 
		their pants to move in.

				GERARD
		I bet they were.
			(to radio)
		Where's the woman?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	BIGGS

	In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

				RENFRO
			(into radio)
		Same room.

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
		Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
		I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
		outside unless called. Radios on 
		three.

	The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
	service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

				NEWMAN
		Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

				GERARD
		Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
		Let's go.

	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN

	DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
	the door.

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

	INT. HOUSE - DAWN

	Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

	THEIR POV

	Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
	OF VIEW.

	A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

	GERARD

	Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
	room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
	bedroom.

	ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

	Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
	off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
	He steps into -

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
	the bedroom.

	HALLWAY

	Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
	continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
	woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
	silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
	opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
	the doorway to the kitchen.

	Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
	He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
	Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

	CUT TO:

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
	didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

	COPELAND

	Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
	Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
	knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
	room.

	We...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		I got your man! Now I want outta 
		here!

	Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
	woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
	fugitive.

	ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

	Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
	through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

	LIVING ROOM

	Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
	his throat.

				COPELAND
			(to Gerard)
		You hear me? I said, I want out or 
		I'll cut your man's throat!

	GERARD

	Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
	at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

	LIVING ROOM

	Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
	hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

	Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
	whips Newman around and we see:

	A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
	late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

	He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
	The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
	stunned but unhurt.

	Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
	bedroom doorway.

				GERARD
		Shut up.

	She does. Immediately.

	EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

	As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
	the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
	sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
	hysterical, clutching his ear.

				NEWMAN
		My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
		of it. I can't believe you did that!

				GERARD
		You think I should have bargained 
		with him, don't you?

				NEWMAN
		Yes. You could've missed! You 
		could've killed me!

				GERARD
		Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
		could've.

	They hold a look.

				GERARD
		How bad's your ear?

				NEWMAN
		Terrible. I probably have permanent 
		hearing damage.

				GERARD
		Let me see it.

	Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

				GERARD
		I don't bargain.

	Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
	unsettling man Gerard is.

				KIMBLE
		I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
		Walter.
	
				GUTHERIE
		Tell me where you are. I'll come
		meet you so you can turn yourself 
		in .

				KIMBLE
		I'm not turning myself in. I need 
		money.

	Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
	the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard. You're asking me to harbor
		and aid a convicted felon... I can't
		help you that way. My advice - both 
		as a friend and as your legal counsel 
		- is for you to give yourself up. 
		Now tell me... where are you?

	Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

				KIMBLE

	INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY

	An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
	the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
	Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his

	goes by.

				DESK ATTENDANT
		See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

	As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
	toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
	Nichols waves the man off.

				NICHOLS
		Not today, please.

	The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
	passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

				NICHOLS
		No. Not -

	... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
	Richard Kimble's.

				NICHOLS
			(stunned)
		Oh, my God... Richard...

	Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

				KIMBLE
		How're you doing, Charlie?

				NICHOLS
		You're alive...

				KIMBLE
		Yeah. And I need your help.

				NICHOLS
		Anything.

				KIMBLE
		I need some money. Whatever you've 
		got on you.

				NICHOLS
		Of course.
	
	Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
	for his wallet...

				NICHOLS
		Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
		get you more money. Some clothes. 
		Just give me an address...

				KIMBLE
		I'll call you.

	Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
	back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
	corner and come up the street behind them.

	Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
	Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

				NICHOLS
		I know why you came back - to find 
		him. If I can help, call me... 
		Call me.

	They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
	don't see it.

				KIMBLE
		Thanks, Charlie...

				NICHOLS
		Here, Richard, take my coat...

	He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
	behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
	mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

				COP
			(to Nichols)
		Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

	Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

	INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

				GERARD
		Call them back. Tell them you've 
		made a mistake.

				POOLE
		What?

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		Stop it there.

	Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

				GERARD
		Drop the voices.

	Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
	BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
	MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
	sounds now.

				GERARD
			(he's heard something)
		Listen.

				BIGGS
		Trains? Traffic?

				GERARD
		More... there's a voice in the 
		background.

	At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
	MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
	Merchandise Mart."

				RENFRO
		That's an El announcement.

				GERARD
		And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
		is in Chicago. Poole, get his 
		artwork out to local police and have 
		C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
		bring in the detectives that handled 
		his case.

	Instantly the room is in movement.

				STEVENS
		I'll prepare the press release.

				GERARD
		No.

	Stevens stops.

				GERARD
		They don't know he's alive and as 
		far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
		I want to keep it that way as long 
		as we can. Are we clear?

	The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
	Kimble.

				RENFRO
			(for the group)
		Perfectly.

	Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

	down hallway and enters.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

	He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks

	the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping 
	bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
	of furniture.

	Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show 
	where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the 
	place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

	Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning 
	supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation

	Kelly and Rossetti share a look, a smile.

		We found nothing.

	The Polish woman shows him a spare but sufficient bed and 
	nightstand set up. She points to door leading up to the 
	street.

	CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE WOMAN'S BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Kimble also at work at the bedside table. He carefully cuts 
	out his do-it-yourself photograph and places it over the 
	existing photograph on the hospital I.D. The name on the 
	I.D. says: Desmondo Jose Ruiz. Then he places a thin piece 
	of lamination plastic and trims the edges.

	Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then 
	examines the finished product not bad.

	INT. MARSHALS' OFFICE - DAY

				KELLY (O.S.)

	young Richard Kimble and Charles Nichols.

				NICHOLS (O.S.)
		Richard Kimble... I saw him two 
		days ago.

	WE PULL BACK to see: Gerard studying the photos. Renfro 
	looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
	in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with 
	awards and photos of Nichols and influential people. Nichols
	hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
	shows no sign of nervousness.

				NICHOLS
		He stopped me in my car. I gave him 
		some money.

				GERARD
		Where was this?

				NICHOLS
		Outside our tennis -
			(correcting himself)
		 - my tennis club.

	Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details.

				GERARD
		Did he ask you for help?

				NICHOLS
		I volunteered. He wouldn't accept 
		it.

				GERARD
		Why do you think he came back to 
		Chicago?

				NICHOLS
		He didn't tell me.

				GERARD
		I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure
		he was trying to protect you from 
		having to lie for him.

	Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, 
	books, drawings, awards and photos.

				GERARD
		If you're really his friend, you'll 
		help us bring him in unharmed.

				NICHOLS
		Why, so he can go back to prison? 
		If you want help, gentlemen, you've 
		come to the wrong man.

	Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari.

				GERARD
		Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. 
		Marshals' office closed out 11,003 
		warrants... 10,975 of those were 
		captured. The twenty-eight others 
		thought they were smarter than 
		us... Now they're dead.

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble mopping the trauma room hallway. The hallway elbows 
	around a corner and Kimble stands less than ten feet from 
	a door that is marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to 
	the doorway, and fails to see an attractive WOMAN DOCTOR 
	with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn 
	the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped 
	section.

	Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't
	see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but 
	keeps walking.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Where's Rudy?

				KIMBLE
		They said he's sick.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Didn't they tell you to put up the 
		sign?

				KIMBLE
		Uhhh. No they didn't.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Put up the 'wet floor' sign before 
		someone gets hurt.

	She keeps going.

				KIMBLE
			(mumbles)
		Asshole.

	She looks back at Kimble.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		What did you say?

				KIMBLE
		Nothing.

	Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall. He watches her 
	turn the corner to the trauma hallway.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab.

	He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, 
	hands, legs hanging from the ceiling. Cables and electronic 
	equipment are on the counters.

	He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the 
	Prosthetic Clinic. He passes a computer room and finally 
	reaches the office. He is about to enter when a woman's 
	voice stops him.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in 
		here?

	Kimble turns to see a PROSTHETIC TECHNICIAN. A large woman 
	with glasses. She stands with a partially finished 
	prosthetic arm.

		Naw... I'm going to be here all

	She slips on a pair of headphones and goes back to work.

	CUT TO:

	"ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging.

	The elevator arrives. They step into:

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

				ANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR)
		Hey, how're you doing?

				KIMBLE
		Fine.

				ANNE
		You find that sign?

				KIMBLE
		Yes, I did.

				ANNE
		You called me an asshole.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me. I was having a bad 
		shift.

	They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

				ANNE
		You worked at other hospitals?

				KIMBLE
		Lots of them over the years. Here, 
		long ago. Hasn't changed much.

				ANNE
		I bet it hasn't. See you.

	They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops 
	and watches him leave.

	INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

	Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking 
	at his information.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

	Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
	of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
	Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
	making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
	attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
	for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

	Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
	on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
	covers his face.

	Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
	Prosthetic Clinic material.

	FLASHBACK - FIGHT

	Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's 
	sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

	returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

	his way.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

	He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
	the back courtyard covered by more cops.

	Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
	he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

	He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
	charging through the basement door they move up the front 
	steps and into the house overhead.

	Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

	KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

	Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He 
	runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, 
	actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and
	pulled away.

	KIMBLE

	Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the 
	Punk Kid out to the car.

	POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

	Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

	of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

				ANNE
		Hey, take this one up the hall to
		Critical Care.

	Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

	Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the 
	hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

	Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble 
	pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

	ANNE

	Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a

		For murdering his wife.

	Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her 
	surprise.

				GERARD
		Thank you for your help, Doctor.

	He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's 
	gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that

				RENFRO
		What I can't figure is, if you were

	Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices

	Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and

	The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the 
	Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, 
	holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

	Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
	any dark-haired man. But still...

		Kimble.

	Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two

	Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

	- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

	Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
	Gerard.

	Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists -

	Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
	alive. He runs free.

		Open the doors!

	Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the

	shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
	parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
	across the seat and opens the door for him.

	He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in,

				SYKES
		Wait a minute... This is the doctor

				GERARD
		Would he have a reason to?

				SYKES
		What the hell's that supposed to

	He lifts his prosthetic arm and stares at Gerard. Gerard 
	holds his look.

				SYKES
		Look, a year ago some people came 
		to see me. They asked me questions 
		about the night of the murder and 
		I'll tell you the same thing I told

		I was on a business trip.

	Gerard continues moving around the apartment.

		Security.

		Independent?

				SYKES
		No, I work for a pharmaceutical

	Gerard holds up one of the fishing photographs with Lentz.

				GERARD
		Any idea why Kimble would be

				SYKES
		No. Just some doctors on a company

	Gerard puts the photos down with the one of Lentz on top. 
	Sykes eyes it.

				SYKES

		Look, you mind if I talk to the cops

				KIMBLE
		Devlin-MacGregor and Lentz. Lentz

		Unless... What if you were a well

		Set it up to look like a robbery 
		gone bad.

		How would you find him? Look in the

				RENFRO
		Through a connection.

				POOLE
		Maybe through a company you did some 
		business with.

				BIGGS
		Like a pharmaceutical company. 
		Someone in security.

				NEWMAN
		On the night of his wife's murder, 
		Kimble attended a hospital benefit 
		sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor 
		Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company.

	Gerard places a Devlin-Macgregor card onto his board.

				BIGGS
		But Sykes claims he was out of town.

				POOLE
		And company records support that he 
		was on a business trip.

				RENFRO
		That's an easy fix. So let's say he 
		was in town. Did the job. Everything 
		goes as planned with one problem.

	  			NEWMAN
		Instead of looking like a robbery 
		gone bad, Kimble ends up being the 
		one accused...

		... tried, convicted...

		... and the hit man gets away clean.

		So Kimble returns to hunt for and 
		find the hit man.

		Why? To share the blame? He'd still 
		go to prison.

	Gerard moves to the board. He takes down a card.

	Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
	driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
	unconscious.

	Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit

	Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the

	The report comes off the scanner.

	Gerard, Renfro and Poole trade looks. Gerard moves toward

	They're gone as we -

	CUT TO:

	Police cruisers pull outside the station.

	INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

	As transit police move up the escalator to the platform, 
	Kimble moves unnoticed through the underground mall 
	beneath the hotel. Deposits the guns into a mail box and 
	keeps moving.

	INT. GERARD'S CAR - NIGHT

	Renfro driving, Gerard and Pool in car. Report comes over 
	the radio.

				POLICE DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		... all units in vicinity of Balbo 
		E1. Officer down. Repeat, officer 
		down. Man leaving scene with two

	Gerard looks out the window, he knows what this means.

				GERARD
			(quietly to himself)
		Damn...

	INT. HOTEL - MALL LEVEL / LOBBY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves up escalators from the underground station 
	into the Hilton.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Disheveled and driven, he moves from the escalators to the 
	lobby - checks the list of hospitality suites and sees 
	board which indicates Nichols speech in the rooftop 
	ballroom. He moves on to the main elevators.

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols speaking. As he talks we MOVE TO...

	ANGLE ON TABLE OF MEN

	Listening - the same men we saw in the hospitality suite 
	when Nichols talked to Kimble. As we MOVE TIGHTER ON one 
	of the men, we notice his name tag says: Board of 
	Directors... Devlin-MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

	INT. HILTON ROOFTOP ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Kimble rides alone to the rooftop ballroom.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	Gerard's car pulls up in front of the hotel. Police are 
	controlling pedestrians. Newman and Biggs, already decked 
	out in Kevlar, meet him.

				NEWMAN
		C.P.D. just reported -

				GERARD
		I heard. Was it Kimble?

				BIGGS
		Conflicting reports, but the cops 
		are considering him a shooter.

	Heavily-armed CPD units pull up. Gerard stares at the police 
	presence. He starts toward the hotel where Kelly is 
	conferring with Kevlar-decked police captain.

				POLICE CAPTAIN
		Witnesses say he entered hotel from 
		the subway.

				KELLY
		Okay. I want it locked down. Start 
		on the lower levels.

	The captain moves off. Gerard intercepts the cop.

				GERARD
		That's my man in there, Kelly.

				KELLY
		Not since he took down one of ours, 
		Gerard. This is a police matter,
		now. Stay, the hell, out of it.

	Kelly moves off. Gerard watches him a moment then he looks 
	up to the roof. Newman hands Gerard his belt with his 
	backup piece.

				GERARD
		C'mon, I know where he's going.

	He moves into the hotel with his deputies.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	LOCKDOWN MONTAGE - EXT. / INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	A) C.P.D. cruisers arriving. Cops deploying to points of

	B) Helicopter with police sharpshooters takes off from 
	Meigs Field downtown and heads for the hotel.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ROOFTOP ELEVATORS/PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble exits the elevators and moves down the corridor to 
	the ballroom. A man tries to stop him at the doors, Kimble 
	simply moves him out of the way and opens the doors to:

	CUT TO:

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Nichols moves to the last of his speech as Kimble enters 
	at the rear

				NICHOLS
		... And I especially would like to 
		thank my researchers who helped me...

	Nichols stops his speech - stunned to see Kimble.

				NICHOLS
		Richard...

				KIMBLE
		What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?

	Kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of 
	doctors toward the podium.

	We see the faces of Kimble's colleagues and friends from 
	the ballroom sequence earlier. At first no one notices 
	Kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais, the 
	applause fades and then room quiets. Whispers of:

				CROWD
		It's Richard. It's Kimble.

	Stunned expressions.

	Kimble continues to the front, talking to Nichols as if 
	the room were empty.

				KIMBLE
		After Lentz died, you were the only 
		one that had access to the 
		pathology reports.

	Nichols remains calm.

				NICHOLS
		Reports? What are you?

				KIMBLE
		You switched the samples and 
		falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 
		could get approval.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I don't know what you're 
		talking about?...

				KIMBLE
		I have a set of the original 
		samples.

	Nichols stares at Kimble and for the first time we see a 
	flicker of concern.

				KIMBLE
		You almost pulled it off, Charlie. 
		But I know all about it now, and I 
		can prove it.

	Nichols and Kimble hold a look. Nichols turns to the audience.

				KIMBLE
		Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as 
		you can see, is obviously not well. 
		Richard, if you want to talk -

				KIMBLE
		I didn't come here to talk

	Nichols leaves the dais and heads toward the exit.

	Kimble tracks along with him - moving through the tables - 
	passing the table with the Devlin-MacGregor board of 
	directors. They are disturbed by this situation.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moves through a door and exits into...

	HALLWAY

	Kimble follows moving through the tables and people to 
	reach the door.

	As soon as he's gone there are calls for "security." Doctors 
	move for the exits.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Gerard, Renfro, Newman, Biggs and Poole move into the lobby.
	Police move to cover the lower floors.

				BIGGS
		C.P.D. has the perimeter, hotel 
		security has the parking structure.

				GERARD
		Let them keep busy down below. 
		Newman, get with security. See if 
		you can locate Kimble from the 
		monitors. Keep in radio contact.

	Newman branches off to Hotel Security. The rest follow 
	Gerard to the rooftop elevators.

	EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARING over Chicago skyline. The bright red sign of the 
	Hilton Hotel looms ahead.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Nichols moves down hallway and turns into a hospitality 
	suite. A moment later Kimble follow and enters the...

	HOSPITALITY SUITE

	... and is immediately smashed with a chair by Nichols. 
	Kimble goes flying, stunned. Nichols locks the door.

				NICHOLS
		Your best quality, Richard, is that 
		you don't give up -

	Nichols pulls Kimble to his feet.

				NICHOLS
		... even when it's clearly in your 
		best interest to...

	He hits him again, drives him back into the library.

	Kimble tries to recover as Nichols relentlessly stays on 
	him. He pulls him up, slams him against the fire escape 
	doors.

				NICHOLS
		I always knew that I'd have to kill 
		you.

	He drives a blow into Kimble's stomach.

				NICHOLS
		Now, I must thank you for giving me 
		200 witnesses tonight who will 
		support me... when I tell them it 
		was self-defense...

	He shoves Kimble through the door out into...

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT

	... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to 
	keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him, 
	but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks 
	Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.

				KIMBLE
		You missed your chance, Charlie...

	Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with 
	two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.

	Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a 
	security camera.

	CUT TO:

	INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

	A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel 
	sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them.

	On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward 
	Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet.

	Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		I've got Kimble on the roof with 
		Nichols. Southeast exit.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Gerard and deputies Poole, Biggs, and Renfro around him.

			(to radio)
		Keep and eye on him. Biggs has roof plans.

				BIGGS
		There are four exits to the roof.

				GERARD
		I want them covered.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the 
	blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another 
	set of stairs to the roof.

				KIMBLE
		You took everything away from me... 
		for money.

	INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The 
	elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented 
	doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet 
	up with two hotel security guards.

				GERARD
		This way.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by 
	the lights of the city skyline.

				KIMBLE
		I want to know, Charlie... was it 
		worth it...?

				NICHOLS
		This thing is bigger than even you 
		think, Richard. You can't stop it.

	He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him 
	against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the 
	street appears far below.

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. 
	The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point 
	them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman stands in front the security monitors and watches 
	Kimble and Nichols on the roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the 
	HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits 
	the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:

				VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
		Chicago police. Freeze.

	In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.

	INTERCUT:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Gerard moves down connecting hallway where a couple of 
	concerned doctors are trying to open the door to the 
	hospitality suite.

				GERARD
			(to doctors)
		Clear the hallway.
			(to security)
		Get that door open.

	The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the 
	hospitality suite for the rooftop.

				GERARD
			(to security)
		Stay at this door.

	He moves through the door to the roof alone.

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman watching the security monitors sees Kimble and 
	Nichols. On another monitor we see Gerard exit the suite.

	EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

	Nichols runs.

	Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape 
	toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.

	The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the 
	rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.

				HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
		I've got a visual on Kimble. He's 
		running.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	Kimble chases Nichols down the roof as BULLETS from the 
	helicopter rip into the air conditioning duct next to Kimble.

	The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.

	ON GERARD

	Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		This is a United States Marshal. 
		Get that helicopter out of here!

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He moves away among the duct work.

	Kimble follows.

	Gerard continues after Kimble.

	The helicopter circles and follows from above.

	INT. PENTHOUSE / DOOR TO ROOF - NIGHT

	Renfro triggers his radio.

				RENFRO
		There is a U.S. Marshal out there. 
		Hold your fire!

	HELICOPTER'S POV

	FOLLOWING Kimble. Its beam tracking Kimble across the 
	rooftop. He moves through the blowers and duct work. 
	Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

	ON SHARPSHOOTER

	He is about to fire when he hears through his radio.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hold your fire.

	The shooter pulls back.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard rushes across the roof toward Kimble.

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles 
	him. The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an 
	elevator housing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Inside the shaft - an elevator moves toward the roof. It 
	stops on the floor ten feet below the roof. THROUGH the 
	glass roof we see the doors open.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - GERARD - NIGHT

	Charges toward -

	KIMBLE

	Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED 
	GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.

	Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

	The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins 
	to drop.

	Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
	him down hard again.

	HELICOPTER

	Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
	Gerard closing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	The elevator doors close and the car beneath the 
	skylight begins to descend.

	GERARD

	Pulls up.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
	and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
	and Nichols into...

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
	and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
	Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
	hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
	himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
	elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the 
	shaft.

	GERARD'S POV

	Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT

	Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency 
	stop and the doors open. He disappears into...

	INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the 
	giant machines.

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
	carefully into the laundry.

	... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
	DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
	move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
	heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

	... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
	stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
	conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

	The NOISE is DEAFENING.

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		Where did the elevator stop?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	NEWMAN IN SECURITY

	Newman checks the computer board for the elevator 
	position.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		Level five.

	INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
	exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
	grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

	KIMBLE

	Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
	stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
	the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
	between the large conveyors.

	ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

	Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
	standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

				GERARD
		Get out of here.

	He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
	worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
	rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
	switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
	takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
	main room.

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		We're going in. Give me five 
		minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

	He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
	room.

	INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

	He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
	dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
	him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

	Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
	voice from the other end of the laundry.

				GERARD (V.O.)
			(above the din)
		Kimble!

	Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
	where Gerard enters.

	ON GERARD

	The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

	They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
	up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
	move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
	equipment.

				GERARD
		... There is no way out of here.

	The building is locked down.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
	the conveyor belts.

				GERARD (O.S.)
		Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
		know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

	ON GERARD

				GERARD
		... Nichols borrowed your car the 
		night of the murder and called 
		Sykes from it.

	RENFRO

	Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
	comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
	dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

	KIMBLE

	Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
	Nichols.

	GERARD

	Moving through the forest of massive bags.

				GERARD
		... That's why there was no forced 
		entry at your house. He'd used your 
		keys.

	KIMBLE 

	Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

	NICHOLS

	Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
	killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
	chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
	hanging control for the I-beam.

	GERARD

	Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
	dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
	see straight back toward the washers. 

				GERARD
		Kimble... Come meet me out here.

	ON RENFRO

	He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
	under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
	WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
	rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
	opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

	NICHOLS

	Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
	shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
	Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

	GERARD

	Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
	belts. He makes one last appeal.

				GERARD
		It's time to quit running... if you 
		don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
		listens, there is no answer.

	KIMBLE

	Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
	shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

	GERARD

	Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
	pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
	on us...

	NICHOLS

	Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
	before he fires however he hears...

				KIMBLE (O.S.)
		Hey, Chuckles...

	Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
	and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
	behind Gerard.

	GERARD

	Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
	with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
	instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

	Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

	They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
	room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

	INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

	Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan 
	Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie

	Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
	ambulance. The doors close.

	REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk 
	giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. 
	We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them 
	TOWARD the entrance.

				T.V. NEWS REPORTER

	ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

	The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of

	A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the 
	ballroom:

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole 
	and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. 
	Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics.

	EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT

	As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights 
	flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd 
	forward, yelling questions.

				REPORTER
		Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
		your innocence!

	Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

				GERARD
			(to police)
		Get them back.

	The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
	a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
	door and helps Kimble inside.

				BIGGS
		Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

	Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
	to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

				GERARD
			(to Poole)
		Poole, you got that thing?
			(to Kimble)
		Give me your hands.

	Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
	Kimble's handcuffs.

	Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
	pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

				GERARD
		Take care of those hands, Doc, 
		you're going to need them again 
		soon.

				KIMBLE
		I thought you told me 'you didn't 
		care.'

				GERARD
		Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

	They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

	HELICOPTER POV

	The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading 
	back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at 
	first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined 
	by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the 
	traffic, movement and lights of the city.

	THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
	to the ballroom.

	ANGLE - COAT CHECK

	The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
	AID FOUNDATION"

	Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.

				ROBERTS (V.O.)
		Richard...

	DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
	of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

				ROBERTS
		Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
		into it...

	A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

				KIMBLE 
		So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
		buys ten new -

				NAT
		No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
		Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
		has no ulterior motives.

				KIMBLE 
		On the house, huh?
			(to bartender)
		Tonic water with lime.

	Everyone agrees.

				KIMBLE 
		Never get me to sell my soul for one
		of those trips...

	His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

	KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
	elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
	T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

		I'm so glad you talked me into

				RICHARD 
		It's for a good cause, Kath...

	She smiles. He moves on.

	ANGLE - PARTY

	Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

				KIMBLE
		Hey, Jim.

	DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
	University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

				NICHOLS
		Richard, I just saw someone who 
		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
	a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
	catch a look and hold it.

				NICHOLS (V.O.)
		Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
		is working on the RDU90 trials for 
		Devlin-Macgregor.

	Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
	smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

				LENTZ
		Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
		trading phone calls last few days 
		... something about a biopsy report 
		I returned to you?

				KIMBLE
			(suddenly attentive)
		Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
		hepatetic to me.

				LENTZ
		I'll be in my office in the morning 
		and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
		a good time for you?

				KIMBLE
		Sure.

				LENTZ
			(holds Kimble's look, 
			then to Nichols)
		See you, Jim.

	Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
	on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
	Nichols move together through the party.

				NICHOLS
			(digs in his pocket)
		Before I forget, I went by the garage
		this afternoon and picket up the 
		Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

	He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

				KIMBLE
		They fix it this time?

				NICHOLS
		We'll see.

	They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
	Kimble kisses her.

				NICHOLS
		You look fabulous, Helen.

	He kisses Helen.

				HELEN (WOMAN)
		Hello, Jim.

				NICHOLS
			(to Kimble)
		We've got a court tomorrow at three.

	Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

				KIMBLE
		Well, I've seen everyone, can we

	ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT

	A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
	others at table ant sit across from each other.

	Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
	mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
	OLDER WIFE.

	Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
	CONTINUE...

	INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.

				NOW EAU WIFE
			(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going 
		to kill us if he didn't stop 
		operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
		he's putting us all at risk.

	Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

				HELEN
			(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
		home.

	They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
	shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
	see Lentz watching.

	INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

	Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
	his hair as he drives.

				HELEN
		You looked handsome tonight...

				KIMBLE
		Thank you...

	He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
	for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

				HELEN
		Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
		like waiters...

				KIMBLE
		But me?

				HELEN
		You looked more like... a band 
		director.

	He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
	changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

	She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

	A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
	claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her

	A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on

	calls up the stairs.

				KIMBLE
		I'm home. Did you hear who won the

	No answer. He steps into the:

	KITCHEN

	The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The

	Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
	Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

	UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

	Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
	Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
	face...

	The SIRENS are LOUDER...

	Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
	down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

	Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

				PROSECUTOR
		Dr. Nichols. You are aware that

		Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
		once said that 'if he had Helen's

		require a meal for transport
		rides of four hours or more.

	Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
	Checks his watch: 4:00.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Jack! Feedin' time.

	Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
	belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

	PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
	the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
	aisle...

	PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
	between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
	CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
	plastic shank.

	Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
	handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
	a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

				COPELAND
		Breathe, and you're first.

	Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
	carelessly ready.

	Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
	doesn't respond.

				YOUNG GUARD
		Suit yourself.

	He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
	sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

	Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

				KIMBLE
		Look out!

	Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
	Young Guard's gut.

	Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
	out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

	Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
	floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
	inside, but...

	Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
	Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under
	the steering wheel. A knee hits the accelerator.

	The CAGE DOOR SLAMS locked behind the Old Guard.

	EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	As the bus careens off the road, accelerating.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Young Guard wrestles gun from Prisoner #2 and FIRES, killing
	prisoner #2. Copeland grapples with wounded Young Guard.

	Old Guard shotgun-butts Prisoner #1, flips the gun, PUMPS 
	ONE ROUND into the man's chest. Dead. He turns just as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	As the driverless BUS BUCKS ant BANGS over open ground.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Old Guard reloads. Copeland drops down behind a seat.

	Old Guard jams his SHOTGUN under the seat. But just as the 
	Old Guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks. The SHOT goes 
	off target as...

	EXT. OPEN LAND - NIGHT

	The BUS ROARS into a gravel embankment. ROARS up the slope
	and CRASHES down on its side - sliding to a stop at the 
	bottom of a small ravine.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

	On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
	him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
	at...

	Kimble. Rising between the seats.

	A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
	off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

	Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
	find Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
			(to Kimble)
		You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

	He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
	medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

				OLD GUARD
		Do something.

	Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
	his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
	Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
	Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

				KIMBLE
		He isn't going to make it unless he 
		gets to a hospital. Fast.

				OLD GUARD
		ZL.

	In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it 
	just settling?

	With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
	Guard's bleeding.

	ANGLE UNDER SEAT

	We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
	back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the 
	opening.

	BACK TO KIMBLE

	A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
	retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
	growing vibration.

				KIMBLE
		Just where the hell are we?

	The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
	looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

				OLD GUARD
		Oh, shit...


	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	The bus lies across railroad tracks. A not-too-distant bend
	grows bright by the light of an approaching train.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble sees: Old Guard fights the cage door. Kimble lunges 
	to his side.

				KIMBLE
		It's locked. Where're your keys?

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Downtrack, one Cyclops light appears.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Kimble spots keys. Pitches them to Old Guard. Drags Young 
	Guard to the front for a quick exit. But Old Guard fumbles 
	the key-ring, his hands shaking as much as the bus.

	The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
	snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

				KIMBLE
		Which one? This? This one?!

	Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
	the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

				KIMBLE
		Help me get him -

	But Old Guard climbs right over Kimble's back and climbs out 
	the shattered windshield.

	ANGLE ON REAR OF BUS

	Copeland escapes through the hole in the back...

	EXT. BUS - NIGHT

	... and hits the ground running the other way. The 
	locomotive's headlight reveals the toppled bus.

	INT. BUS - NIGHT

	Train light grows. A nanosecond of uncertainty: Should 
	Kimble leave the wounded man? Kimble and the Young Guard 
	hold a look.

	EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT

	As the WHEELS BRAKE and LOCK.

	EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble struggles out of the bus - pulling the Young Guard 
	behind him. He slings the man clear.

	SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

	For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

	The train light X-rays him.

	Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
	away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
	dozen mincing steps before...

	IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
	splitting it open.

	Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
	feet, still running feverish half-steps.

	An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
	flanks.

	The train burns past the wounded Guard.

	Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
	him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

	Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
	after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
	chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
	of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
	nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
	something in his hand.

	It's the key-ring.

	EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

	Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key. 
	Suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key-ring away.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		Give me that.

	Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
	own chains.

				COPELAND
		You listen to me. I don't give a 
		damn which way you go, just don't 
		follow me.

	Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his 
	arm and runs. Kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the 
	other direction - crossing a hilltop in the moonlight.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. CRASH SITE (SOUTHERN ILLINOIS) - NIGHT

	News and sheriff's department choppers circle billowing 
	smoke. TILT DOWN to reveal the derailed train. Fire engines 
	hose down the blackened locomotive. Rescue workers work 
	feverishly with jaws-of-life to get into the mangled 
	wreckage. Illuminated by spotlights, transportation 
	investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted 
	remains of the bus. State troopers restrain spectators.

	Two American-made rental cars pull up. Four deputy U.S. 
	marshals emerge:

	BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick 
	shithouse.

	RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds 
	fully-equipped.

	POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during 
	nut-cuttin' time.

	NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

	From the second car steps GERARD. He takes in the media 
	spectacle.

				GERARD
		Good lord...

				REFRO
		What is this... a circus?

	As a group they begin moving along the service road above 
	the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below 
	them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they 
	walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

	Biggs spots something...

				BIGGS
		Point of impact.

	... and branches off.

				GERARD
		Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman.

				BIGGS
		Shit.
			(to Newman)
		Come on.

	They drop down to the crash site. Poole ant Renfro remain 
	with Gerard.

	A state TROOPER steps into their path, but falls away when he
	sees Gerard's Marshall star.

				GERARD
		How ya doing? Who's in charge?

				TROOPER
		Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the 
		lights -

	Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
	scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

	Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
	about to happen.

	ANGLE - OLD GUARD

	Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
	shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
	SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
	news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
	b.g., listening.

				OLD GUARD
		... train was bearin' down on us, 
		fast. I don't know how - it's still 
		kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
		and pushed him out of the bus.

				SHERIFF
		You coulda both been killed.

				OLD GUARD
		I know, but hell, he's my partner.
		Woulda done the same for me.

	The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
	eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

				GERARD
		Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
		U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

				SHERIFF
			(annoyed)
		I'll be with you in a minute.

	The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
	his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
	of all four prisoners.

				SHERIFF
			(to Old Guard)
		For the record. These three dead. 
		And this one...

	He switches to a photo of Kimble.

				OLD GUARD
		Well, everything happened so fast...
			(bites lip, decides)
		Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

	Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
	prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

				SHERIFF
		You get some rest.

	He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

				SHERIFF
		Looks like you came a long way for 
		nothing. My men've already done a 
		thorough search from point of 
		impact and found nothing.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	ANGLE - CULVERT

	Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
	something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

	GERARD

	Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

				GERARD
		With all due respect, may I suggest 
		check-points starting at a 15-mile 
		radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
		of -

				SHERIFF
		Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
		Prisoners are all dead. The only 
		thing check-points will do is get a 
		lot of good people out here frantic 
		and flood my office with calls.

	Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
	we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

				GERARD
			(beat)
		Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
		that to happen... So, I'll be 
		taking over the investigation.

				SHERIFF
		On whose authority?

				GERARD
		By authority of the Governor of the 
		State of Illinois and the office of
		the United States Marshal, 5th 
		District Northern Illinois...

	Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
	from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

				SHERIFF
			(back-down beat)
		Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
		this mess, you got it.
			(to assistants)
		Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
		mop up for us.

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

				GERARD
		Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
		back and give this poor man some 
		room.

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
	change of story and command.

	Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
	Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

				GERARD
			(friendly, to Old 
			Guard)
		Always an interesting thing when we 
		find leg irons and no legs in them 
		who held the keys, sir?

				OLD GUARD
		Uh, me.

				GERARD
		Would you be so kind as to show them
		to me, sir?

	Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

	The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
	press hovering just out of earshot.

				GERARD
		Second chance.

	Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

	The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

				OLD GUARD
			(cracking)
		He mighta got out.

				GERARD
		Thank you.

				SHERIFF
		What the hell is this? A minute ago 
		you tell me he's part of the 
		wreckage, now you're -

				GERARD
		Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
		an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
		up operations right here.

	He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
	downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
	Israelites behind Moses.

				GERARD
		Ladies and gentlemen... our 
		fugitive's been on the run for 
		ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
		over uneven ground - barring injury 
		is approximately four miles an hour, 
		giving us a radius of six miles. I 
		want a hard-target search of any 
		residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
		henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
		that area. Check-points go up at 
		15 miles.
			(to media)
		You got that? Good. Now, turn 
		those damn things off and get out 
		of our way.

	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
	dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

	EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT

	Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
	The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
	later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

	EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT

	Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
	blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
	going to need stitches.

	Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
	moving.

	EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN

	Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
	of the lights.

	A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
	road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
	mile.

	ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM

	Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
	nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
	He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
	jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
	breath.

	Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
	the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
	cover behind the wrecked car.

	The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
	seat and closes the door.

	He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
	something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
	and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
	coveralls missing from the seat.

	As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
	side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
	clutching the coveralls.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN

	A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
	crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
	lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
	tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

	Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
	relays it to Gerard.

				POOLE
		Blood trail found. Two miles 
		southwest.

				GERARD
			(to Biggs)
		Type it and match it against all 
		four prisoners.
			(to Renfro)
		Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
		every local hospital.
			(to Newman)
		Newman...

	Newman appears.

				NEWMAN
		Yes, sir...

				GERARD
		I need some coffee.

	As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
	from the train crash.

	ANGLE - TRAIN CRASH

	A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

				WORKER
		Hey, one's alive!

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

	Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food 
	outside kitchen entrance. Kimble, in the tow truck 
	operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
	Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

	A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a 
	bandaged hand, and a MOTHER leave a room and walk TOWARD us.
	Behind them, Kimble moves down the hall and stops in front 
	of the doorway.

	KIMBLE'S POV - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM

	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - MINOR PROCEDURES ROOM - MORNING

	Kimble closes the door and locks it. Hanging on the back of 
	the door we see a doctor's white coat.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

	An Illinois State Trooper's car pulls up outside.

	CUT TO:

	CLOTH-COVERED INSTRUMENT TRAY

	On it we see: A packaged sterilized bandage, an opened 
	antiseptic wash, an opened topical anesthetic, and an empty 
	syringe. We PULL BACK to find:

	KIMBLE

	His wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash, three stitches 
	already in. With pair of forceps he picks up the needle as 
	he sutures himself.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LONG SHOT (MOS) - MORNING

	At far end of the hall we see a STATE TROPER chatting with a 
	DUTY NURSE at a nurses' station.

	CUT TO:

	Kimble, his bandage already in place, gives himself a shot 
	of antibiotics.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - MAN'S ROOM - DAY

	A man, tube in nose, on two I.V.s, lays in bed with eyes 
	closed. Kimble comes INTO FRAME near his face.

	KIMBLE
	Can you hear me, sir?

	No response. The man is out of it. Kimble backtracks to the 
	patient's closet and opens it. Hanging inside we see his 
	clothes. He removes them and notices the man's untouched 
	breakfast tray.

	His arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call 
	button.

	CUT TO:

	INT. NURSES' STATION - DAY

	A fax photograph of Richard Kimble slowly comes off the 
	duty station FAX MACHINE. Next to the machine the 
	patient's call light comes on.

	The Duty Nurse, standing with the Highway Trooper, sees the 
	patient's light come on and starts down the hall toward the 
	patient's room.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PATIENT'S BATHROOM - DAY

	Kimble shaving when we hear the DUTY NURSE ENTER the 
	patient's room. He moves OUT OF FRAME.

				DUTY NURSE (O.S.)
		Mr. Patterson, do you need some more 
		water?

	ANGLE - MAN'S EATEN BREAKFAST

	The Duty Nurse looks from the tray to the man, impressed.

				DUTY NURSE
		... Oh, you did a good job on this.

	She takes his empty plastic pitcher and...

	... pushes open the bathroom door - no sign of Kimble - and 
	refills the pitcher from the sink.

				DUTY NURSE
			(over her shoulder, 
			to patient)
		... It does get dry in here, doesn't 
		it?

	She doesn't expect an answer, turns OFF the WATER, and goes 
	into the main room. As the door closes we see Kimble behind 
	it.

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and 
	a doctor's white coat, moves down the hall to the emergency 
	room exit. Suddenly the State Trooper steps back from the 
	E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
	down the corridor toward Kimble.

	The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

				TROOPER
		'Scuse me, Doc?...

	Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
	doors behind him.

				TROOPER
		... Don't know if you heard or not 
		but we're looking for an escaped 
		prisoner from that bus train wreck 
		'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
		show up here if he was hurt.

				KIMBLE
		What's he look like?

	The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
	trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
	Kimble's cheek.

				TROOPER
			(from fax sheet)
		Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
		brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

	At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
	it clean as the Trooper looks up.

				TROOPER
		... Seen anyone that fits that 
		description?

				KIMBLE
		Every time I look in the mirror ...
		but without the beard.

	They laugh.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me...

				TROOPER
		Sure.

	Kimble moves through the E.R. doors as an ambulance parks 
	outside...

	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM RAMP - DAY

	Two PARAMEDICS try to take out a patient on a gurney. The 
	lead wheels are stuck.

				KIMBLE
		Here...

	Kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney 
	comes free.

				PARAMEDIC #2
		Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out 
		from under a train.

	As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
	of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

				YOUNG GUARD
		It's him... It's -

	Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
	Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

				KIMBLE
		How is he?

	The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

				PARAMEDIC #1
		He's pretty bad off. Broken leg, 
		ribs. Concussion.

	As Kimble moves away...

				KIMBLE
		Tell the E.R. doctor he's also got 
		a perforated spleen.

	He's gone... The two Paramedics share a look as they whisk 
	the Young Guard inside.

				PARAMEDIC #2
			(impressed)
		Jesus, how could he tell that from 
		looking at his face?

	ANGLE - AMBULANCE

	Kimble climbs behind the wheel.

	EXT. TRAIN CRASH SITE / OPERATIONS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	A full communications link is in place.

	Deputy marshals answer phones, work faxes, add information 
	to a situation board. Troopers bring in information. Poole 
	calls Gerard.

				POOLE
		Background just came in from

				GERARD
		Hit me.

	Renfro and Poole lay out the details. The download of

				RENFRO
		Richard David Kimble. Vascular 
		Surgeon. Convicted of first-degree 
		murder in the killing of his wife. 
		Pleaded innocent. Claimed a

				GERARD
		Let's not retry the case. Priors
		and accomplices?

	Gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the 
	investigation to take a leak. Followed by Renfro and Poole.

				RENFRO
		None. No previous arrests.

	Poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as Gerard 
	unzips his fly and relieves himself.

				GERARD
		Sealed juvie record?

	Poole calls out from behind tree.

				POOLE
		Nothing. Total cherry.

				GERARD
		Relatives? Children?

				RENFRO
		No relatives.

				POOLE
		One child. A son. Died in drowning 
		accident three years ago.

				GERARD
		Girl friends? Ex-wives? Friends? 
		Combinations of the above?

				POOLE
		Lot of friends. Doctors. Hospital 
		staff.

	Gerard zips up.

				GERARD
		Start there. Authorize taps. Cover
		his lawyer first.

				RENFRO
		Never get it.

				GERARD
		Bet me.

	Renfro won't take it.

		... We're waiting up here in Canton.
		Wondering if you heard anything on 
		this Kimble chase -

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad 
	crossing. The biocom monitors police chatter:

				DISPATCHER (V.O.)
		Two-twelve-A, be advised that all 
		discussion on this matter is to be 
		conducted on a tactical frequency 
		- either Channel K or Z. Over.

	Frequency goes dead. Kimble looks THROUGH the windshield:

	ROAD SIGN

	An arrow points toward Canton, two miles.

	The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal 
	suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop. Kimble pops 
	the SIREN and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and 
	heads in the opposite direction... but his maneuver gets 
	attention.

	INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY

	Truck driver watches Kimble cut through the crossing and 
	reaches for his C.B. radio.

	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAY

	Poole hangs up phone.

				POOLE
		Ambulance just spotted two miles 
		west of Doverville. Heading north 
		on State road 53.

	Renfro turns to the map and marks it. The circle is much 
	smaller.

				RENFRO
		Running outta map, Sam.

	The crash site and hospital are already marked. Gerard is 
	ready to move.

				GERARD
		Just the way we want it. Okay, 
		people, let's button up.

	They move off to waiting State Trooper cars and helicopter.

	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

	Kimble driving down a rural road. He flips down visor and 
	eyeballs folded roadmap...

	EXT. SECONDARY ROAD (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	... The ambulance crests a hill. In the distance we see the 
	Grosvner Viaduct and the Barkley Dam.

	EXT. HIGHWAY (KENTUCKY) - DAY

	Blowing other traffic off the road, WHOOPING CRUISERS and 
	G-cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of 
	Southern Illinois. Overtaking them all, a CHOPPER THUNDERS 
	overhead.

	INT. HELICOPTER

	Heading into hilly terrain. Down below we see the ambulance. 
	Inside the helicopter Gerard eyes the terrain.

				PILOT
			(into radio)
		We've got a visual...
			(to Gerard)
		He's heading toward the viaduct.

				GERARD
		Seal it up.

	EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF GROSVNER VIADUCT - DAY

	The two-lane road disappears into long tunnel. Three hundred 
	feet below the road tumbles the Tennessee River.

	The Barkley Dam rises ahead. Kimble's AMBULANCE ROARS into 
	the tunnel.

	ON KIMBLE

	Suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at 
	the mouth of the tunnel.

	Kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat.

	ANGLE - FAR END OF TUNNEL (BEHIND HIM)

	Illinois Highway Patrol cars pull to a stop at the far 
	entrance. Light flares. Set out road blocks.

	ANGLE HELICOPTER

	Gerard steps out followed by Renfro and Poole.

	KIMBLE'S AMBULANCE

	Comes to a stop, blocking traffic in both directions. 
	Immediately HORNS begin BLARING.

	EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

	Trooper pulls up. Biggs and Newman behind Kimble blocking 
	the other end.

	Troopers with guns drawn block the exits. The P.A. from a 
	State patrol car blares:

				P.A. (V.O.)
		Please remain in your vehicles and 
		lock your doors. Repeat, please 
		remain in -

	ANGLE ON HELICOPTER

	Poole and Renfro materialize already decked out in Kevlar. 
	They're jacked up and ready to rock. Renfro hands Gerard a 
	vest.

				RENFRO
		Got him.

	Gerard unholsters a 40 caliber, Glock model 22.

				GERARD
		Okay, ladies and gentlemen hard 
		part's over.

	He starts into the tunnel.

				RENFRO
			(to radio)
		We're movin' in.

	INT. TUNNEL - DAY

	Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three 
	silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' 
	P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb 
	back inside and lock their doors.

	Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the 
	middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.

	Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the 
	ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain 
	clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

	Running water.

	ON MARSHALS

	They reach the mid-tunnel area. No Kimble. Biggs looks 
	around, beneath vehicles. Gerard listens. Poole looks 
	confused.

				POOLE
		Where'd he go?

	Gerard spots the trickle of water. He backtracks it until 
	he finds a loose grate in the pavement. Man-size.

				GERARD
		Biggs, Renfro with me.

	INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows 
	at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. 
	A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips 
	off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues 
	straight ahead.

	Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit
	wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong 
	to...

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro. They push on, soon reaching the 
	forking tunnels. Renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs.

				GERARD
		Channel Three.

	They conform their radios. Splitting up, Biggs and Renfro go 
	left. Gerard - straight ahead.

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble. Bracing with all four limbs. Negotiating a mossy 
	downslope.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Biggs and Renfro. Sweeping his light as he advances. 
	Searching for splash-patterns.

				BIGGS
			(into shoulder-mike)
		Nothing yet.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard. Probing a branch-off tunnel with his light. About to 
	pass, he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the 
	branch-off tunnel. Hand marks?

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Got a possible here. Stand by.

	He stows his light but hangs onto the Glock. Bracing with 
	three limbs

	INT. DOWNSLOPE CONDUIT - DAY

	Gerard begins the tricky descent. Slips once. Recovers. 
	Slips again...

	... and tumbles out of control. GUN and RADIO CLATTER AWAY.

	Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. 
	Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
	lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
	there first.

	It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
	flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

				KIMBLE
		I didn't kill my wife.

				GERARD
		So, you didn't kill your wife.

	Not my problem.

	An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
	silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

				BIGGS (V.O.)
		Gerard? You there?

	Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

	Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up 
	piece.

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	As Renfro hears FOOTSTEPS POUNDING his way.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Gerard charges down the tunnel. From a side tunnel, Renfro 
	appears, almost colliding. Biggs follows...

				GERARD
		Straight ahead!

	INT. CONDUIT - DAY

	Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance 
	in the tunnel. He spills around a corner and stops. Ahead 
	lies an orb of light. The tunnel ends. The NOISE is 
	incredible. Kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and 
	stops.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam 
	disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of 
	mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

	He hears the MARSHALS behind him - COMING CLOSER.

	ANGLE - MARSHALS

	Gerard and Renfro turn the corner. Renfro drops into a 
	shooting stance.

				GERARD
		Turn around, hands over your head. 
		And get down on the ground.

	For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

				GERARD
		Your choice, Kimble...

	Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
	water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
	up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
	water toward Kimble.

				GERARD
		Get down on your knees.

	Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
	footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY

	Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
	into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
	the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

	INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY

	Renfro lowers his gun.

				RENFRO
			(amazed)
		Son of a bitch...

	It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

	ON GERARD

	He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
	stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
	something invaluable about this fugitive.

	EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY

	Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
	near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
	helicopter converge on the site.

	EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

	Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

	The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
	stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET

	Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
	shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

	Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

	FROM SHORE

	Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
	the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
	ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Running out of daylight, Inspector.

				GERARD
		Lights and generators are coming, 
		Captain.

				HEAD TROOPER
		Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
		job, but maybe one person in a 
		million could've survived that fall.
		The guy's fish food.

	Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

				GERARD
		Then find me the fish that ate him.

	He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

	EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

	Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
	sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
	exhausted.

	KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY

	ANGLE

	Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
	her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO 
	FRAME and kisses her.

	DISSOLVE TO:

	ANGLE

	Helen tosses her head back. She wears white silk pajamas 
	and smiles down AT us. A hand reaches up and unbuttons the 
	top two buttons of her top. Then Kimble moves up INTO FRAME 
	as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BEACH - DAY

	Helen running down beach TOWARD us. Embraces Kimble as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POOL - DAY

	Helen's head comes up out of a pool. Hair tossed back, she 
	smiles as we -

	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder. She 
	looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles.

				HELEN
		Good-bye. I love you.

	Again... Then again... then:

	HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. FOREST - MORNING

	Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
	remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

	EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING

	Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
	tunnel.

	INT. DRUG STORE - DAY

	Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
	party 
	to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

	Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

	ANGLE - PHONE

	Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
	RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
		and Wainwright.

				KIMBLE
		Walter Gutherie please.

				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
		I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
		for the day, would you like his 
		voice mail?

	Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
	of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
	shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
	sees the pharmacist looking at him.

	EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
	new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
	moves down the road to the diner.

	INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
	WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
	tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need to look at the menu?

				KIMBLE
		Some soup, please.

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Good choice.

	She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
	Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

	A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
	stares at him.

	A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
	away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
	he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

	Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
	his soup. Where's the first waitress?

	Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
	sees:

	The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
	going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

	A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

	ANGLE - TV

	A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
	chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
	from the fall.

	Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
	the counter and exits.

	EXT. DINER - NIGHT

	Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
	he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
	the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

	Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
	sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
	hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
	faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
	a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
	inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
	chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
	looks at himself. He's shaking.

	A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
	to him, passenger window rolls down...

				OLDER WAITRESS
		Need a ride?

	Kimble stares at her.

				KIMBLE
		Which way are you going?

	She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
	They hold a look as we hear:

				RENFRO (V.O.)
		We feel confident about the I.D.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. HOUSE - DAWN

	A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
	woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
	down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
	early morning traffic.

	We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
	street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
	that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
	woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
	radio.

				RENFRO
		Local officials were about to wet 
		their pants to move in.

				GERARD
		I bet they were.
			(to radio)
		Where's the woman?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	BIGGS

	In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

				RENFRO
			(into radio)
		Same room.

				GERARD
			(into radio)
		Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
		Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
		I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
		outside unless called. Radios on 
		three.

	The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
	service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

				NEWMAN
		Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

				GERARD
		Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
		Let's go.

	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN

	DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
	the door.

				GERARD
		U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

	INT. HOUSE - DAWN

	Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

	THEIR POV

	Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
	OF VIEW.

	A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

	GERARD

	Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
	room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
	bedroom.

	ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN

	Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
	off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
	He steps into -

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
	the bedroom.

	HALLWAY

	Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
	continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
	woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
	silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
	opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
	the doorway to the kitchen.

	Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
	He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
	Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

	CUT TO:

	SMALLER BEDROOM

	Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
	didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

	COPELAND

	Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
	Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
	knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
	room.

	We...

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

				COPELAND (O.S.)
		I got your man! Now I want outta 
		here!

	Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
	woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
	fugitive.

	ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN

	Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
	through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

	LIVING ROOM

	Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
	his throat.

				COPELAND
			(to Gerard)
		You hear me? I said, I want out or 
		I'll cut your man's throat!

	GERARD

	Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
	at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

	LIVING ROOM

	Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
	hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

	Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
	whips Newman around and we see:

	A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
	late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

	He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
	The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
	stunned but unhurt.

	Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
	bedroom doorway.

				GERARD
		Shut up.

	She does. Immediately.

	EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

	As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
	the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
	sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
	hysterical, clutching his ear.

				NEWMAN
		My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
		of it. I can't believe you did that!

				GERARD
		You think I should have bargained 
		with him, don't you?

				NEWMAN
		Yes. You could've missed! You 
		could've killed me!

				GERARD
		Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
		could've.

	They hold a look.

				GERARD
		How bad's your ear?

				NEWMAN
		Terrible. I probably have permanent 
		hearing damage.

				GERARD
		Let me see it.

	Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

				GERARD
		I don't bargain.

	Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
	unsettling man Gerard is.

	EXT. CHICAGO PAY PHONE - MORNING

	Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered 
	TRAINS COME and GO in the b.g. An EL CROSSES OVERHEAD. The 
	BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.

				KIMBLE
		Walter. It's Richard.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. LAW OFFICES OF GUTHERIE, MORGAN AND WAINWRIGHT - DAY

	Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking 
	Lake Michigan.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard... Jesus, why did you run? 
		Running only makes you look guilty.

				KIMBLE
		I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
		Walter.
	
				GUTHERIE
		Tell me where you are. I'll come
		meet you so you can turn yourself 
		in .

				KIMBLE
		I'm not turning myself in. I need 
		money.

	Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
	the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

				GUTHERIE
		Richard. You're asking me to harbor
		and aid a convicted felon... I can't
		help you that way. My advice - both 
		as a friend and as your legal counsel 
		- is for you to give yourself up. 
		Now tell me... where are you?

	Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

				KIMBLE
			(beat)
		St. Louis.

				GUTHERIE
		Give me an address. I'll be -

	CLICK. Gutherie hears the LINE GO DEAD. Kimble's gone.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

	Kimble stands in the doorway with cup of coffee. He considers 
	his next move. Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 -
	he knows what that move is.

	INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY

	An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
	the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
	Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his 
	tennis bag. A friendly DESK ATTENDANT Sharon) smiles as he 
	goes by.

				DESK ATTENDANT
		See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

				NICHOLS
		Creature of habit, Sharon.

	EXT. NORTH BANK CLUB - DAY

	Dr. Nichols leaves the club. He tosses his gym bag into the 
	back of his car and drives off.

	INT. / EXT. NICHOLS'S CAR - DAY

	As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
	toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
	Nichols waves the man off.

				NICHOLS
		Not today, please.

	The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
	passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

				NICHOLS
		No. Not -

	... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
	Richard Kimble's.

				NICHOLS
			(stunned)
		Oh, my God... Richard...

	Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

				KIMBLE
		How're you doing, Charlie?

				NICHOLS
		You're alive...

				KIMBLE
		Yeah. And I need your help.

				NICHOLS
		Anything.

				KIMBLE
		I need some money. Whatever you've 
		got on you.

				NICHOLS
		Of course.
	
	Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
	for his wallet...

				NICHOLS
		Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
		get you more money. Some clothes. 
		Just give me an address...

				KIMBLE
		I'll call you.

	Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
	back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
	corner and come up the street behind them.

	Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
	Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

				NICHOLS
		I know why you came back - to find 
		him. If I can help, call me... 
		Call me.

	They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
	don't see it.

				KIMBLE
		Thanks, Charlie...

				NICHOLS
		Here, Richard, take my coat...

	He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
	behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
	mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

				COP
			(to Nichols)
		Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

	Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

	INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

	REWINDING. The media room - just what it sounds like -
	banks of audio/video equipment and a sound board.

	Renfro rewinds the tape. Gerard, Biggs, Poole and Newman.

				POOLE
		We've alerted St. Louis P.D

				GERARD
		Call them back. Tell them you've 
		made a mistake.

				POOLE
		What?

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		Stop it there.

	Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

				GERARD
		Drop the voices.

	Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
	BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
	MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
	sounds now.

				GERARD
			(he's heard something)
		Listen.

				BIGGS
		Trains? Traffic?

				GERARD
		More... there's a voice in the 
		background.

	At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
	MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
	Merchandise Mart."

				RENFRO
		That's an El announcement.

				GERARD
		And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
		is in Chicago. Poole, get his 
		artwork out to local police and have 
		C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
		bring in the detectives that handled 
		his case.

	Instantly the room is in movement.

				STEVENS
		I'll prepare the press release.

				GERARD
		No.

	Stevens stops.

				GERARD
		They don't know he's alive and as 
		far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
		I want to keep it that way as long 
		as we can. Are we clear?

	The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
	Kimble.

				RENFRO
			(for the group)
		Perfectly.

	Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

				GERARD
		Noah... go to my office and let's 
		officially take Dr. Kimble out of 
		purgatory.

		I ran his office for twelve years. 
		Yes, we were very close. But he 
		wouldn't come to me for help.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

	Busy with doctors, orderlies and street people. Kimble moves 
	down hallway and enters.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY

	He moves into the room and takes a new patient form, looks 
	around. SEE BACK INTO the office area of the clinic. It 
	could be any hospital clinic from this view.

	But as Kimble turns to leave we see a PATIENT waiting to be 
	called. On his lap we see a prosthetic arm. Kimble looks up 
	from the arm to the man.

				PATIENT
		Good morning.

	INT. KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - DAY

	Gerard walks through Kimble's house. The art and most of 
	the furniture is gone. Books are in boxes and shopping 
	bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
	of furniture.

	Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show 
	where the art once hung. Gerard pauses, tries to absorb the 
	place. He takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it.

	INT. COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY

	Kimble moves past the lockers, racks and boxes of cleaning 
	supplies, stops at a board listing work schedules, vacation 
	leaves, locker numbers. Behind him a LOCKER SLAMS. As a 
	janitor moves off to the showers we see his locker did not 
	close but remains slightly ajar from the impact.

	A card on a community bulletin board advertises a basement

	Kelly and Rossetti share a look, a smile.

	watches Kimble.

				ROSETTI (V.O.)
		We found nothing.

	The Polish woman shows him a spare but sufficient bed and 
	nightstand set up. She points to door leading up to the 
	street.

	CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE WOMAN'S BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

	Kimble also at work at the bedside table. He carefully cuts 
	out his do-it-yourself photograph and places it over the 
	existing photograph on the hospital I.D. The name on the 
	I.D. says: Desmondo Jose Ruiz. Then he places a thin piece 
	of lamination plastic and trims the edges.

	Kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look, then 
	examines the finished product not bad.

	INT. MARSHALS' OFFICE - DAY

				KELLY (O.S.)
		If this guy existed believe me 
		someone would've found him.

	ON GERARD

	He raises an eyebrow.

	CUT TO:

	INT. DR. NICHOLS' OFFICE - CLOSE ON FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH - DAY

	Of medical residents. Two photographs next to each other. A
	young Richard Kimble and Charles Nichols.

				NICHOLS (O.S.)
		Richard Kimble... I saw him two 
		days ago.

	WE PULL BACK to see: Gerard studying the photos. Renfro 
	looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
	in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with 
	awards and photos of Nichols and influential people. Nichols
	hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
	shows no sign of nervousness.

				NICHOLS
		He stopped me in my car. I gave him 
		some money.

				GERARD
		Where was this?

				NICHOLS
		Outside our tennis -
			(correcting himself)
		 - my tennis club.

	Gerard moves around Nichols' office taking in the details.

				GERARD
		Did he ask you for help?

				NICHOLS
		I volunteered. He wouldn't accept 
		it.

				GERARD
		Why do you think he came back to 
		Chicago?

				NICHOLS
		He didn't tell me.

				GERARD
		I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure
		he was trying to protect you from 
		having to lie for him.

	Gerard continues to move around the room, study prints, 
	books, drawings, awards and photos.

				GERARD
		If you're really his friend, you'll 
		help us bring him in unharmed.

				NICHOLS
		Why, so he can go back to prison? 
		If you want help, gentlemen, you've 
		come to the wrong man.

	Gerard finds a photo of Nichols and a gleaming Ferrari.

				GERARD
		Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. 
		Marshals' office closed out 11,003 
		warrants... 10,975 of those were 
		captured. The twenty-eight others 
		thought they were smarter than 
		us... Now they're dead.
			(re: the photo)
		Nice car.

	Gerard puts the photo down.

	EXT. NICHOLS' OFFICE - DAY

	Gerard clearly feels he's come to the right man.

				GERARD
		Stay on him.

	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble mopping the trauma room hallway. The hallway elbows 
	around a corner and Kimble stands less than ten feet from 
	a door that is marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	He watches a technician leave the clinic and mops closer to 
	the doorway, and fails to see an attractive WOMAN DOCTOR 
	with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn 
	the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped 
	section.

	Head down, she is completely absorbed in a file and doesn't
	see the wet floor until she slips slightly, looks up but 
	keeps walking.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Where's Rudy?

				KIMBLE
		They said he's sick.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Didn't they tell you to put up the 
		sign?

				KIMBLE
		Uhhh. No they didn't.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		Put up the 'wet floor' sign before 
		someone gets hurt.

	She keeps going.

				KIMBLE
			(mumbles)
		Asshole.

	She looks back at Kimble.

				WOMAN DOCTOR
		What did you say?

				KIMBLE
		Nothing.

	Anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall. He watches her 
	turn the corner to the trauma hallway.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab.

	He moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms, 
	hands, legs hanging from the ceiling. Cables and electronic 
	equipment are on the counters.

	He leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the 
	Prosthetic Clinic. He passes a computer room and finally 
	reaches the office. He is about to enter when a woman's 
	voice stops him.

				WOMAN (O.S.)
		Hey, Ricky... Weren't you just in 
		here?

	Kimble turns to see a PROSTHETIC TECHNICIAN. A large woman 
	with glasses. She stands with a partially finished 
	prosthetic arm.

	MEMORY HIT - INT. KIMBLE'S OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

	The one-armed man's arm coming off in the fight.

		No... I've got to clean the blinds

				TECHNICIAN
		Naw... I'm going to be here all

	She slips on a pair of headphones and goes back to work.

	CUT TO:

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC OFFICE - LATER

	INT. HALLWAY - ANGLE ON ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Kimble waits for the elevator. The folders in his uniform 
	shift and he tries to rearrange them. When he turns back 
	we see Anne Eastman beside him. Her I.D. says: 
	"ANNE EASTMAN". She sees him doing the rearranging.

	The elevator arrives. They step into:

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Anne moves to the back. Kimble on the other side.

				ANNE (WOMAN DOCTOR)
		Hey, how're you doing?

				KIMBLE
		Fine.

				ANNE
		You find that sign?

				KIMBLE
		Yes, I did.

				ANNE
		You called me an asshole.

				KIMBLE
		Excuse me. I was having a bad 
		shift.

	They laugh. They reach ground level and step out together.

				ANNE
		You worked at other hospitals?

				KIMBLE
		Lots of them over the years. Here, 
		long ago. Hasn't changed much.

				ANNE
		I bet it hasn't. See you.

	They part ways. Kimble continues out the door. Anne stops 
	and watches him leave.

	INT. EL TRAIN - NIGHT

	Kimble sits on the night train going home. He begins looking 
	at his information.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

	Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets 
	of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over 
	Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, 
	making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
	attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
	for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

	Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
	on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
	covers his face.

	Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
	Prosthetic Clinic material.

	FLASHBACK - FIGHT

	Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's 
	sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind 
	returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

	FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

	Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the 
	STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again.

	Another DOOR SLAMS, but this time the sound is distinctly 
	different... a CAR DOOR.

	INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM (BACK TO PRESENT)

	Kimble yanks the wet rag from his face, his senses alert. 
	Listening, he hears: FOOTSTEPS are real, just outside and 
	MOVING TOWARD him.

	HARD CUT TO:

	A car door slams. We see unmarked police cars pulling up in 
	front of the apartment. Cops are moving toward the house.

	Kimble turns off his light, moves from the bed to the window. 
	Carefully looks out:

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Unmarked police cars in front of the house, looking, moving 
	his way.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

	He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
	the back courtyard covered by more cops.

	Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
	he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

	He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
	charging through the basement door they move up the front 
	steps and into the house overhead.

	Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

	KIMBLE'S POV - BACK STEPS

	Kimble SEES the Punk Kid try to escape out the back. He 
	runs, sees cops and runs toward Kimble's basement door, 
	actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and
	pulled away.

	KIMBLE

	Moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the 
	Punk Kid out to the car.

	POLICE RADIOS call the other cops to stand down.

	Kimble moves slowly to his front door. Looks out.

	KIMBLE'S POV

	Cops put the young man into an unmarked police car. His 
	grandmother, the Polish woman, follows them, crying.

	Kimble leans against the wall, exhausted.

	A wanted poster of Kimble over the cop's head.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The Kid sees - Wanted for Murder - realizes who it is.

				PUNK KID

		Hey. Hey! I know that guy!

	The cop looks up, sees Kimble's poster and then back at the 
	Kid.

	CUT TO:

	INT. TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic. In passing through 
	the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing. 
	A major accident has happened, victims are being brought in.

	The P.A. CALLS for doctors. STATIC.

	ANGLE ON FAR END OF TRAUMA HALLWAY

	Elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients. 
	Some walk, some are helped by family and police. Nurses 
	direct traffic.

	Orders fly. Medicines are called. Family members yell for 
	doctors. Ask for the injured. Anne picks up the pace with 
	an ORDERLY wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient, 
	a BOY.

				ANNE
		What happened?

				ORDERLY
		A bus flipped off the overpass. Got
		at least twenty more coming in.

				ANNE
		What about this one here?

				ORDERLY
		Fractured sternum. X-ray's coming 
		up.

	Anne checks the boy's chart.

				ANNE
		Okay, we've got to get some room
		in this hallway, people.

	Orderlies quickly move the non-life-threatening patients out
	of the hall. Still more help is needed. Anne spots Kimble.

				ANNE
		Hey, take this one up the hall to
		Critical Care.

	Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

	Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the 
	hall. As he pushes he looks at the kid's X-rays.

	Anne looks up, barks another order, then suddenly sees Kimble 
	pushing the gurney and looking at the film.

	ANNE

	Tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a 
	better look, but Kimble is gone. She goes back to work.

	ON KIMBLE

	He wheels the Boy's gurney into an elevator. The doors 
	close.

	INT. HOSPITAL - O.R. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Kimble wheels the gurney down the hall and stops the Boy 
	on the scrub threshold to the O.R. and stops a SURGEON.

				KIMBLE
		Hey. Hey!

	A Surgeon pauses and eyes Kimble's janitor suit and the 
	gurney.

				KIMBLE
		They just sent this one up.

	He takes a look at the Boy's chart and grabs the X-rays and 
	yells to O.R. nurse.

				SURGEON
		Bob! Get this one into room four, 
		stat.

	He looks up, Kimble is gone.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble enters the Prosthetic Clinic computer room. The 
	Technician from the day before is listening to her Walkman,
	sees Kimble and waves. Kimble waves back and turns into the 
	glass-walled computer room and closes the door.

	He closes the blinds and turns on the computer.

	CUT TO:

	INT. CRITICAL CARE UNIT - NIGHT

	The crisis has wound down. Anne moves into the room and 
	begins checking patients. She stops a unit nurse, GLADYS.

				GLADYS
		What boy?

				ANNE
		The one with the fractured sternum.

				GLADYS
		He never came in here.

	INT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble scans DOS files, each an eight-letter enigma. Finds 
	one with promise and loads it up.

				KIMBLE
		Wrong...

	He backs up and tries another file.

	"CLIENT DEMOGRAPHIC ORGANIZER SEARCH BY: AGE, SEX, RACE, 
	LIMB, OR OTHER?"

	Kimble knows he's got it.

	INT. OPERATING ROOM WING - NIGHT

	Anne comes out of the stairwell and stops the Surgeon we 
	saw with Kimble.

				ANNE
		Dave, did you see a janitor come up 
		here earlier?

				SURGEON
		Yeah, he brought a kid up.
			(handing her the chart)
		Anne, did you write the orders? I 
		couldn't make out the signature...

				ANNE
		I saw -

				SURGEON
			(in a hurry now)
		Whoever did knew what the hell he 
		was doing. Kid's a hair away from

	He heads to the operating room, leaving her stunned. She 
	stares at the scrawled orders.

	DO YOU WISH TO SUBDIVIDE?"

				KIMBLE
		Seventy-five. Hell, yes.

	Kimble types in another defining characteristic... 
	Residence: Illinois.

	Again he waits. Rattles the blinds to make it seem like he's 
	cleaning. The list shortens.

	"NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES: 21"

	EXT. PROSTHETIC CLINIC/TRAUMA HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Kimble leaves Prosthetic Clinic and starts down the hall

				ANNE (O.S.)
		Do you have a particular interest in

	Kimble turns to see Anne coming toward him.

				KIMBLE
		What do you mean?

				ANNE
		I saw you looking at that boy's

	She moves in on him. He eyes the exit.

				KIMBLE
		It's a hobby of mine -

		What other hobbies do you have? 
		Brain surgery?

				KIMBLE
	What do you want?

	She reaches him.

				ANNE
		I want to know how that kid ended 
		up in surgery.

				KIMBLE
		I'm a janitor. I did what I was

				ANNE
		Bullshit. Who changed those orders?

	They hold a look. She knows. He takes a step back and she 
	pulls his I.D.

		You stand right here. I'm calling

				ANNE
			(firmly)
		A little boy's alive today because 
		he did something.

	Gerard watches her eyes carefully.

				GERARD
		So, you weren't aware that when he 
		escaped he was being transported to 
		Menard State Prison to begin a term 
		of life imprisonment.

				ANNE
		For what?

				GERARD
		For murdering his wife.

	Clearly this is news to Anne. Gerard almost smiles at her 
	surprise.

				GERARD
		Thank you for your help, Doctor.

	He moves to the position Anne saw Kimble with the kid's 
	gurney. Trying to imagine what Kimble was doing at that 
	place. Renfro and the other deputies converge.

				RENFRO
		What I can't figure is, if you were 
		Kimble, why'd you take a major 
		league chance of hanging around a 
		trauma ward?

	Gerard considers this as a Man passes him. Gerard notices 
	something.

				RENFRO

	Slowly Gerard separates from the group of deputies and 
	follows the Man down the hall.

	The Man Gerard is following turns the corner to the 
	Prosthetic hallway and realizing Gerard is following him, 
	holds the hallway door open for Gerard.

				MAN
		Can I help you find something?

				GERARD
		Thank you, sir, I think you already

	We see the Man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside 
	the door marked: "PROSTHETIC CLINIC"

	Kimble waits for an elevator. It opens to reveal a pack of

				ELEVATOR COP

		Comin' or not?

	Forcing his feet to move, Kimble boards...

	... and pivots quickly. Elevator rises. Floor-indicator moves 
	deathly slow.

	Kimble feels the breath of a dozen COPS on his neck. And just 
	when his floor is mercifully about to arrive...

	Overhead lights flicker, and the elevator jars to a stop 
	between floors.

				COPS
		Aw, shit... Not now... Anybody

	Kimble exits the visitor's area. He sees another crowd of

	Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator. Finally Gerard's

	Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the

	INTERCUT WITH:

	GERARD

	Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims 
	shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.

	Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

	One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the 
	shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the 
	stairwell railing to spy...

	Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
	any dark-haired man. But still...

				GERARD
		(a quick probe)
		Kimble.

	Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two 
	landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain 
	his step, keeps moving.

	But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's 
	stride told him everything.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - LOBBY - DAY

	Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby. 
	Sees two cops, quickly approaches.

				KIMBLE
		Officers - there's a man in the

	The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves
	toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak 
	himself in civilians.

	He shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs.

	Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN 
	sounds.

	People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors 
	begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. 
	Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door.

	GERARD

	Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

				GERARD
		Kimble. Stop!

	But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.

	KIMBLE

	Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the 
	outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble 
	is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
	- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

	Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
	Gerard.

	Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
	but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,
	shoves a man out of his line of fire.

				GERARD
		Down. down. everybody down!

	With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the 
	opening...

	... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like 
	in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks
	back over his shoulder at...

	Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and 
	clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

				GERARD
		Kimble. Stop!

	It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his 
	leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as

	INT. FEDERAL LOCKUP - DAY

	Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

	Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A 
	long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with 
	bullet holes, he sees...

	Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
	alive. He runs free.

				GERARD
		Open the doors!

	Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
	glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
	It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
	rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

	Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

	But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations 
	outside. Blending in with the marchers.

	Fredrick Sykes.

	He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus 
	shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
	parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
	across the seat and opens the door for him.

	He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, 
	he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a 
	handgun.

	Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.

	EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING

	Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind

		Half the people in the study were

		come into the study with bad livers?

				WAHLUND
		The one on the right is one of the 
		samples you sent me. It shows a lot 
		of perriportal inflammation loaded 
		with eosinophils. When you see that 
		with the accumulation of bile it's 
		a classic for -

		- drug induced hepatitis.

				WAHLUND
		I'm impressed. Now look at this.

	She positions a second slide.

		According to the study, this is a

	She yields the microscope to Kimble.

		Oh, last summer sometime. August... 
		Why?

	Kimble looks up from the protocol report.

	Go ahead. You don't have it in you .

	For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the

	Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
	driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
	unconscious.

	Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit

		Now, I must thank you for giving me 
		200 witnesses tonight who will 
		support me... when I tell them it 
		was self-defense...

	He shoves Kimble through the door out into...

	EXT. FIRE ESCAPE BALCONY - NIGHT

	... and almost over the railing. Kimble grabs the rail to 
	keep from dropping to the street. Nichols closes on him, 
	but Kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks 
	Nichols back against the other side of fire escape.

				KIMBLE
		You missed your chance, Charlie...

	Nichols charges Kimble, but Kimble drives him back with 
	two crushing blows that send Nichols down the stairs.

	Kimble moves down the stairs after him - passing under a 
	security camera.

	CUT TO:

	INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

	A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel 
	sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them.

	On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward 
	Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet.

	Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		I've got Kimble on the roof with 
		Nichols. Southeast exit.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Gerard and deputies Poole, Biggs, and Renfro around him.

				BIGGS
			(to radio)
		Keep and eye on him. Biggs has roof plans.

				BIGGS
		There are four exits to the roof.

				GERARD
		I want them covered.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

	Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the 
	blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another 
	set of stairs to the roof.

				KIMBLE
		You took everything away from me... 
		for money.

	INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT

	Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The 
	elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented 
	doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet 
	up with two hotel security guards.

				GERARD
		This way.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by 
	the lights of the city skyline.

				KIMBLE
		I want to know, Charlie... was it 
		worth it...?

				NICHOLS
		This thing is bigger than even you 
		think, Richard. You can't stop it.

	He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him 
	against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the 
	street appears far below.

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. 
	The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point 
	them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman stands in front the security monitors and watches 
	Kimble and Nichols on the roof.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the 
	HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits 
	the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:

				VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
		Chicago police. Freeze.

	In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.

	INTERCUT:

	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT

	Gerard moves down connecting hallway where a couple of 
	concerned doctors are trying to open the door to the 
	hospitality suite.

				GERARD
			(to doctors)
		Clear the hallway.
			(to security)
		Get that door open.

	The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the 
	hospitality suite for the rooftop.

				GERARD
			(to security)
		Stay at this door.

	He moves through the door to the roof alone.

	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT

	Newman watching the security monitors sees Kimble and 
	Nichols. On another monitor we see Gerard exit the suite.

	EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

	Nichols runs.

	Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape 
	toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.

	The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the 
	rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.

				HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
		I've got a visual on Kimble. He's 
		running.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Kelly listens on his ratio.

				KELLY
		Bring him down.

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Kimble chases Nichols down the roof as BULLETS from the 
	helicopter rip into the air conditioning duct next to Kimble.

	The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.

	ON GERARD

	Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		This is a United States Marshal. 
		Get that helicopter out of here!

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He moves away among the duct work.

	Kimble follows.

	Gerard continues after Kimble.

	The helicopter circles and follows from above.

	INT. PENTHOUSE / DOOR TO ROOF - NIGHT

	Renfro triggers his radio.

				RENFRO
		There is a U.S. Marshal out there. 
		Hold your fire!

	HELICOPTER'S POV

	FOLLOWING Kimble. Its beam tracking Kimble across the 
	rooftop. He moves through the blowers and duct work. 
	Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

	ON SHARPSHOOTER

	He is about to fire when he hears through his radio.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hold your fire.

	The shooter pulls back.

	INTERCUT WITH:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard rushes across the roof toward Kimble.

	ANGLE - NICHOLS

	He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles 
	him. The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an 
	elevator housing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Inside the shaft - an elevator moves toward the roof. It 
	stops on the floor ten feet below the roof. THROUGH the 
	glass roof we see the doors open.

	CUT TO:

	EXT. ROOFTOP - GERARD - NIGHT

	Charges toward -

	KIMBLE

	Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED 
	GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.

	Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

	The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins 
	to drop.

	Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
	him down hard again.

	HELICOPTER

	Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
	Gerard closing.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	The elevator doors close and the car beneath the 
	skylight begins to descend.

	GERARD

	Pulls up.

				GERARD
		Kimble!

	Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
	and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
	and Nichols into...

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

	Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
	and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
	Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
	hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
	himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
	elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT

	Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the 
	shaft.

	GERARD'S POV

	Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.

	CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT

	Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency 
	stop and the doors open. He disappears into...

	INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the 
	giant machines.

	INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
	carefully into the laundry.

	... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
	DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
	move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
	heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

	... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
	stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
	conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

	The NOISE is DEAFENING.

	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

	Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

				GERARD
			(to radio)
		Where did the elevator stop?

	INTERCUT WITH:

	NEWMAN IN SECURITY

	Newman checks the computer board for the elevator 
	position.

				NEWMAN
			(to radio)
		Level five.

	INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT

	Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
	exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
	grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

	KIMBLE

	Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
	stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
	the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
	between the large conveyors.

	ANGLE - SORTING ROOM

	Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
	standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

				GERARD
		Get out of here.

	He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
	worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
	rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
	switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
	takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
	main room.

				GERARD
			(to Renfro)
		We're going in. Give me five 
		minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

	He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
	room.

	INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT

	He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

	He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
	dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
	him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

	Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
	voice from the other end of the laundry.

				GERARD (V.O.)
			(above the din)
		Kimble!

	Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

	ON NICHOLS

	Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
	where Gerard enters.

	ON GERARD

	The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

	They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
	up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
	move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
	equipment.

				GERARD
		... There is no way out of here.

	The building is locked down.

	CUT TO:

	KIMBLE

	Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
	the conveyor belts.

				GERARD (O.S.)
		Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
		know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

	ON GERARD

				GERARD
		... Nichols borrowed your car the 
		night of the murder and called 
		Sykes from it.

	RENFRO

	Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
	comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
	dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

	KIMBLE

	Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
	Nichols.

	GERARD

	Moving through the forest of massive bags.

				GERARD
		... That's why there was no forced 
		entry at your house. He'd used your 
		keys.

	KIMBLE 

	Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

	NICHOLS

	Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
	killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
	chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
	hanging control for the I-beam.

	GERARD

	Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
	dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
	see straight back toward the washers. 

				GERARD
		Kimble... Come meet me out here.

	ON RENFRO

	He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
	under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
	WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
	rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
	opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

	NICHOLS

	Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
	shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
	Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

	GERARD

	Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
	belts. He makes one last appeal.

				GERARD
		It's time to quit running... if you 
		don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
		listens, there is no answer.

	KIMBLE

	Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
	shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

	GERARD

	Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
	pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
	on us...

	NICHOLS

	Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
	before he fires however he hears...

				KIMBLE (O.S.)
		Hey, Chuckles...

	Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
	and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
	behind Gerard.

	GERARD

	Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
	with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
	instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

	Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

	They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
	room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

	INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

	Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan 
	Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie 
	for space in front of the Hilton Towers.

	Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
	ambulance. The doors close.

	REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk 
	giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. 
	We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them 
	TOWARD the entrance.

				T.V. NEWS REPORTER
		... As we reported a few minutes 
		ago, the saga of once-prominent 
		Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble, 
		who escaped from an Illinois 
		Corrections bus, took a strange
		twist this evening when Dr. Kimble 
		was captured at the Chicago Hilton...

	ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

				ANOTHER REPORTER
		... there are unconfirmed reports 
		from police of new evidence which 
		may exonerate Kimble while 
		implicating some of the biggest 
		names in medicine...

	The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of 
	photographs.

	A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the 
	ballroom:

				STUNNED DOCTOR
		He just walked in... We didn't know 
		what he was going to do. My wife 
		was very frightened... The next 
		thing I knew cops were charging in 
		and...

	CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole 
	and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. 
	Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics.

	EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT

	As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights 
	flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd 
	forward, yelling questions.

				REPORTER
		Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
		your innocence!

	Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

				GERARD
			(to police)
		Get them back.

	The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
	a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
	door and helps Kimble inside.

				BIGGS
		Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

	Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
	to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

				GERARD
			(to Poole)
		Poole, you got that thing?
			(to Kimble)
		Give me your hands.

	Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
	Kimble's handcuffs.

	Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
	pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

				GERARD
		Take care of those hands, Doc, 
		you're going to need them again 
		soon.

				KIMBLE
		I thought you told me 'you didn't 
		care.'

				GERARD
		Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

	They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

	HELICOPTER POV

	The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading 
	back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at 
	first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined 
	by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the 
	traffic, movement and lights of the city.

INT.  SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit
in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,
a 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing.
Reading from prepared material:

                         HAYES
          ... last few years have brought many
          advances in the interests of women
          in naval service, particularly in
          the land-based maritime specialties.
          What's more, the Navy has instituted
          special sensitivity courses with an
          eye on --

                         DEHAVEN
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based
          maritime specialties." Gimme a
          second here to de-euphemize that...

At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to
ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card
reads "CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE." DeHaven is a
tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.
In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --
and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.

                         DEHAVEN
          Would that be anything like
          "typing"?  "Restocking the
          cupboards"?  That sort of thing, Mr.
          Hayes?

CHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go
stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile.

                         HAYES
          Hardly the case, Senator.

                         DEHAVEN
          Well, I'm just an old dame without
          much time left, so you'll pardon me
          if I jump right in here before they
          discontinue my blood-type.  I am
          deeply concerned over the Navy's
          seemingly incontrovertible attitude
          toward women in the military.  Case
          in point...

On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members
of the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him.

                         DEHAVEN
          "The Lark Report."

                         HAYES
          Madam Senator... this is an internal
          document of the U.S. Navy.  I must
          seriously question whether --

                         DEHAVEN
                  (to others on panel)
          The Navy's conclusion regarding the
          crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft
          carrier.  Female aviator, it just so
          happens.
                  (to Hayes)
          You're familiar with this report and
          its conclusion, am I right?

                         HAYES
          I was one member of the investigating
          commission.

                         DEHAVEN
          Yes, I see your signature right here
          -- twice the size of everyone
          else's.  And your conclusion was
          "pilot error," hmm?

                         HAYES
          I'm really not prepared for any kind
          of in-depth review of --

                         DEHAVEN
          I'd like to think our next Secretary
          of the Navy would be prepared for
          anything, Mr. Hayes.

A humorless smile.  She's roasting his nuts over an open
fire, and everyone knows it.

                         HAYES
          The commission concluded that the
          aviator in question failed to
          execute a proper approach to the
          carrier.

                         DEHAVEN
          That aside for the moment, I'm
          struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit
          of your report... the degrading
          remarks by other aviators...
          innuendo about her performance in
          unrelated situations... even a
          reference to her sexual activity the
          weekend prior.
                  (closing report)
          In my seven years on this committee,
          I've never seen a downed aviator
          treated like this.  Never.  I'm
          deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.
          Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for
          women in the military -- but for
          your own confirmation as well.


INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Heading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small
PRESS RETINUE.

                         DEHAVEN
          ... a full 35 percent of all jobs in
          the U.S. military are still, to this
          day, off-limits to women.  And
          that's simply gotta change.

                         PRESS #1
          What about those who say women
          aren't suited for all jobs?  That
          they're physically weaker... they
          have less stamina...

                         DEHAVEN
          Sure.  And we're gonna hog the
          bathroom, too.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside.

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE
          White House boys want a private
          meeting.

                         DEHAVEN
          I'll act surprised.


INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Shoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high
stockings while devoting one ear to...

                         WHITE HOUSE #1
          ... to reassure you that he has
          every faith in the ability of Mr.
          Hayes to guide the Navy into the
          next century.  The task, as the
          Administration sees it, is to
          acknowledge changing realities
          without losing traditional values.

A beat.  DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys --
#1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.

                         DEHAVEN
          'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on
          the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go
          back to the President and tell him
          to open up the phone book and start
          lookin' for his next nominee.

White House #1 looks spanked.  Taking over, #2 pops a
briefcase.  An inch-think report appears before DeHaven.

                         WHITE HOUSE #2
          Administration's plan for 100
          percent integration.  If female
          candidates measure up in a series of
          test cases, the President will
          support full integration within
          three years' time.

Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through
the report, absorbing by osmosis.

                         WHITE HOUSE #2
          It's your gender-blind Navy,
          Senator.  Surely you're not going to
          balk now.

                         DEHAVEN
          Well, it's just that askin' you all
          to integrate the Navy is like
          sending a man to do a woman's job.
                  (a beat)
          How do you propose to handle the
          Combat Exclusion Laws?

                         WHITE HOUSE #2
          Keep narrowing the definitions.
          Keep redefining.

                         WHITE HOUSE #1
          We got around it in Saudi Arabia.

                         DEHAVEN
          By calling women "Honorary Men."
          Ingenious.

                         WHITE HOUSE #2
          C'mon, Senator, President's pitchin'
          right down the center of your plate.
          If women measure up to men, they've
          got the job.  You going to take a
          swing?  Or step out of the box?

DeHaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over.
Thinking light years ahead.


EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Buttoning up topcoats, the White House boys move down
marble steps to reach a pair of limousines.  Hayes and two
FLAG OFFICERS wait.

                         HAYES
          Well?

                         WHITE HOUSE #2
                  (shaking hand)
          Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.


INT.  HAYES' LIMOUSINE - DAY

Inside the moving car:

                         HAYES
          So she picks the women, we pick the
          programs.  Seals?

                         FLAG OFFICER #1
          I'd go Special Reconnaissance.
          Every bit as tough -- and we have a
          60 percent drop-out rate among the
          men.

                         HAYES
          Then I suggest we start there.

                         FLAG OFFICER #1
          Doesn't matter who she picks.  No
          woman is going to last one week in a
          commando training course.  And I
          don't care who it is.


EXT.  POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

Winterscape:  Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends
through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow,
morning water calm.  There's an almost hallowed beauty to
it all.  Soon we pick out...

A spot of day-glo.  Coming out of the mouth of morning.
Overtaking the floes.

CLOSER on JORDAN O'NEIL.  She pushes her flat-water kayak
downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time.
Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington
bridge, she passes...

Cars overhead.  Grid-locked by snow conditions.

In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic
behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument.
Something BURRS from a life-vest pocket.  She rips through
velcro to free a cell phone.

                         JORDAN
          Lieutenant O'Neil.

                         ROYCE (V.O.)
          Gotta situation here.  Where are
          you?  Stuck in traffic?

                         JORDAN
                  (checking dive watch)
          Not due in for 22 minutes, sir.
          Watcha got?


INT.  SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY

                         ROYCE
          All right, stand by, we're going to
          switch over to COMSAT...

A TACTICAL OFFICER reroutes the call via defense
satellite, cryptography flashing on terminals.  Lieutenant
Commander ROBERT ROYCE joins other Intel officers at a
conference table.  They're pouring over weather charts,
navigation logs, high-altitude NRO video.

          to the North Korean shore, near a

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
          Do we know it's him using the
          beacon?  Not a decoy?

                         ROYCE
          Signals received only sparingly, in
          such a pattern that leads us to
          conclude it is a downed aviator
          trying to conserve his batteries.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
          Chances of recovery?

                         ROYCE
          You're the analyst for East China,
          O'Neil.  Analyze.


EXT.  POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

Riding the current, Jordan blows a troubled sigh as she
accesses the file of her brain.  Drifting past the
Jefferson Memorial:

                         JORDAN
          North Korean beaches are the best
          protected, most heavily monitored in
          the world.  The civilian population
          is so propagandized that it acts as
          an Early Warning system.  Extraction
          team has to be small and silent --
          I'd go with Seals over Delta Force.
          Problem is, don't want to hold a
          conventional sub off-shore for
          target practice.  Where's The Polk?

INTERCUTTING:

                         ROYCE
          Halfway 'round the world.  So that's
          the problem -- we can get the team
          in, just not out.

                         JORDAN
                  (an inspired beat)
          Unless you Whiskey Run.

                         ROYCE
          Blank faces here, O'Neil.

                         JORDAN
          Quick-hit technique used by Capone.
          Rigged a getaway car with running
          boards and handles.  All his guys
          had to do was jump on and take a
          ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 --
          I doped it out as a contingency
          plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks
          up the package, links up with
          recovery sub.  But don't waste time
          opening and closing hatches.  They
          just grab the periscope and hang on
          for neutral waters.

A dubious beat.

                         ROYCE
          You expect the extraction team to
          ride the sub bare-back?  Is that
          correct, O'Neil?

                         JORDAN
          Only four minutes to neutral waters,
          sir.  Why not?

Silence on the radio:  They're discussing her scenario
privately.  During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of
the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers.  On the far bank
lies...

Naval Intel Center (N.I.C.), bristling with communication
antennae.

Jordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response.

                         ROYCE
          All right, sending the
          recommendation across the river.
          Royce out.

The phone goes dead.

                         JORDAN
          No, thank you, sir.


EXT.  SECURITY STATION - N.I.C. - DAY

Bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian
employees transit a security station on their way inside.
Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and
balancing a collapsed kayak on her head.  She flashes a
photo-badge and double-times inside.


INT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY

Jordan exits a locker room.  Smoothing out her Khaki
uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock
doors.  Falling in step:

                         ROYCE
          That was good headwork, lieutenant.

                         JORDAN
          Thank you, sir.  We hear back from
          the Pentagon?

                         ROYCE
                  (scoffing)
          Probably hear back from CNN first.

                         JORDAN
          Hate this part.  Just sweating it
          out on the sidelines.

                         ROYCE
          Intel has its own glory, lieutenant
          -- no matter how subtle.

Now they reach...


INT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY

A circular chamber.  Dominating the ground floor is the
bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations.  On the
second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen.

                         ROYCE
          By the way, I'll need that option
          paper by 11-hundred today so I can
          review it with Admiral Hanover.  And
          do we have any of that breakfast tea
          around here?

                         JORDAN
                  (with a look)
          Is this my glory, sir?

On the upper walkway, a frazzled N.I.C. SECRETARY
appears.  She spots Royce and Jordan below.

                         N.I.C. SECRETARY
          Excuse me, but I have Senator
          DeHaven on the line for you.

                         ROYCE
          Jesus God, what now?

He bounds up the stairs toward his office.

                         N.I.C. SECRETARY
          I'm sorry, sir no -- she asked to
          speak with Lieutenant O'Neil.

Royce turns back and gives Jordan a hall-of-fame look.
"Oh, really?"


INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

                         DEHAVEN
                  (into phone)
          So everyone I talk to says you're
          top drawer with silk stockings
          inside.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
          Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask
          what this is regarding?

                         DEHAVEN
                  (reading file)
          High-school pentathlete... ROTC
          scholarship, graduated with

          Training... and, as it just so
          happens, a constituent of my home
          state of Virginia.  Oh, the things
          I'll do for one extra vote.


INT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY

On the phone, Jordan glances around.  Co-workers mull
within earshot.  Those out of earshot post E-mail memos on
Jordan's computer:  "Moving up in life."  "I want a full
report."  "Don't tell her who you really voted for."

                         DEHAVEN
          Lieutenant O'Neil, I am prepared to
          nominate you for the Navy's Special
          Reconnaissance program.  Should you
          accept, you'll ship out to Coronado
          next week and join in the big
          testosterone festival.  Complete the
          course, and you'll have a fast
          ticket to any assignment you want.
          That's my personal promise to you.

A beat as Jordan's mind catches up to her ears.  Now
INTERRCUTTING the two:

                         JORDAN
          "Coronado."

                         DEHAVEN
          California.

                         JORDAN
          I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just
          that... Beggin' your pardon,
          Senator, but... do you understand
          that this involves combat training?

                         DEHAVEN
          This is just a test case, O'Neil.
          But if it works out -- if you work
          out -- it could well change the
          Navy's official policy on women in
          combat.  Or, actually, its official
          non-policy.  Now who's your
          immediate superior there?

                         JORDAN
          Captain Dwyer.  Technically.

                         DEHAVEN
          My office will fill him in and help
          expedite.  Look forward to meeting
          you at the proper time.  Jumping off
          now...

                         JORDAN
          Uh, question, ma'am.

                         DEHAVEN
          Yes, dear.

                         JORDAN
          Would I be the only one?  The only
          woman?

                         DEHAVEN
          There'll be more to follow -- but
          yes, dear, right now you're the pick
          of a very large litter.  And your
          success would mean a lot.  Jumping,
          now...

The line goes dead.  Jordan hangs up catatonically.

                         JORDAN
          Well, shit-a-doodle-do...


EXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - NIGHT

A small gunkhole harbor up the Potomac.  Snow falls thick
and silent on overturned canoes, stored for the winter.
Beyond stands a clapboard rental house.


INT.  JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

It's not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and
wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a
training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room.
In the kitchen we find...

A naked man.  He's steeping tea.

                         JORDAN (O.S.)
          ... well, I survived Basic Training
          and three brothers -- so I know how
          to fight.  What scares me are the
          sexual politics.  I don't want to be
          turned into some poster girl for
          women's rights.

CAMERA FOLLOWS as the naked man carries a steaming mug
through the house...


INT.  BATHROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

... and sets it down beside Jordan, languishing in a tub.
Snow builds on a window sill.  Facing Jordan, the man
slides into the tub.

                         ROYCE
          So why're you even considering it?
          Are you?

                         JORDAN
          Just like you would be.

                         ROYCE
          Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world-

          want you there, Jordan.

                         JORDAN
          I take it you don't either.  Feet.

Dutifully, Royce massages her feet.

                         ROYCE
          Well, you're doin' shit-hot at
          Intel.

                         JORDAN
          Royce.  We're the same age, we
          started the same time -- and now
          you're sitting in the upperdecks
          while I'm still down in the bullpen.
          What does that tell you about the
          Navy?

                         ROYCE
                  (shaking head)
          She's haze grey and underway...

                         JORDAN
          You need operational duty to really
          advance... you need combat training
          to go operational... yet combat
          training is off-limits to people
          with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel.
          Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm
          beating my head on a big brass
          ceiling.

                         ROYCE
          So dump on me.

                         JORDAN
          This has nothing to do with you.

                         ROYCE
                  (getting out)
          Well, guess I don't even need to be
          here...

                         JORDAN
          Get your dick back here.  It has
          everything to do with you.

                         ROYCE
          You're such a ball-breaker
          sometimes.  Especially at night.

                         JORDAN
          Sorry.  But after our days...
                  (a thoughtful sip)
          So if I try this thing... if I ship
          out to Coronado... what happens
          here?

                         ROYCE
          I'll try to keep the door open.  If
          you wash out, I make it so that --

                         JORDAN
          Wai', wait.  What happens if it
          works?  Four months of training,
          three years of operational duty.
          What then?

                         ROYCE
                  (blowing a sigh)
          I don't feel like doing an option
          paper on the rest of my life,
          Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it
          happen.

                         JORDAN
          Which is guy-speak for...

                         ROYCE
                  (conceding)
          Sounded lame as soon as it came out
          of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be
          honest, okay?  Three years is a long
          time.  Don't ask me to predict how
          I'll feel then, Jordan, because I
          don't know.  And either do you.

                         JORDAN
          You know, right up until you said
          that -- I thought I did know.

Wounded, she gets out.

                         ROYCE
          Jordan...

                         JORDAN
          Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up
          like such a tough call -- and then
          you go and make it so goddamn easy.
          Really, thank you so much.

She punches into a robe and leaves.  Royce considers
drowning himself in the tub.


EXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - SAN DIEGO - DAY

Jordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping
Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead.

A flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge.
Suddenly two NAVY HELOS BLAST overhead, scattering the
pelicans.


EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

On base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt
courtyard.  The is "the grinder," reminiscent of a
gladiator's arena.  She notices at one end...

A silver ship's bell.  Hung prominently.

                         JORDAN
          Excuse me, lieutenant.  I was told

A DUTY OFFICER looks up to find Jordan across a counter.
In no particular hurry, the duty officer makes his way
over to check Jordan's orders.

                  (looking up)
          So you're the one.

Hearing, other workers look up.  Among them is a female
ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no
concession to her sex.  Throughout, she'll watch Jordan
with more than passing interest.

                         JORDAN
          Still don't have my bearings yet.
          Direct me to the officer's quarters?

The duty officer stamps her paperwork, returns it with
room assignment and keys.

                         DUTY OFFICER
          You'll proceed directly to the
          infirmary for eye tests, blood
          tests, urinalysis, pregnancy test.
          Uniform issue adjacent.  Then you're
          to report to the Base Commander.
          He'd like a word with you.

                         JORDAN
          Fine.  And the officer's quarters?

                         DUTY OFFICER
          C.O.'s office can supply you with
          directions.  Enjoy your visit,
          lieutenant.

It's a nasty little barb -- one that Jordan decides to let
slide.  Jordan turns for the door.  Blondell catches up
with a base map.

                         BLONDELL
          B.O.Q., south side.  Take a
          starboard tack out the door.

                         JORDAN
          Thank you, ensign.

                         BLONDELL
          No problem, lieutenant.


INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

A soft KNOCKING.

                         C.O.
          Come.

A YEOMAN opens the door.  Behind him is Jordan.

                         YEOMAN
          Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil reporting,
          sir.

For a beat, COMMANDING OFFICER (C.O.) TURRENTINE takes
stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a
fighter across the ring.  Then he stubs out a perfectly
good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the
back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out
for her.

                         C.O.
          Yes, of course.  Please, have a
          seat, lieutenant...

                         JORDAN
          Thank you, sir.

                         C.O.
          Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?

                         JORDAN
          I'm fine, sir.

                         C.O.
          So.  We're still coming to terms
          with the exact protocol for this --
          for integrating the Spec-Recon
          training.  It may not always be
          smooth, but we're trying to make it
          as painless as possible for you.

                         JORDAN
          Thank you, sir.  But I expect a
          certain amount of pain.

More stock-taking.  Is he looking at her hair?

                         JORDAN
          Barber was my next stop, sir.
          Would've had it regulation sooner,
          only --

                         C.O.
          Don't worry about it.  If it's off
          your collar and out of your eyes,
          that's all I'm going to ask.

                         JORDAN
          Really, I have no problem with --

                         C.O.
          I'm not out to change your sex,
          lieutenant.  You'll have separate
          beds, separate heads.  If you have
          specific medical needs, inform the
          infirmary.  If a classmate or
          superior acts in an harassing or
          otherwise unbecoming manner, please
          inform me immediately so I can deal
          with it immediately.  Questions?

                         JORDAN
          None at this time, sir.

                         C.O.
          Then that's all I have to say.
          Dismissed.

Another smile, another phantom gesture on the back of her
chair.  If Jordan was expecting a fight, the bell never
sounded.  She rises, salutes -- then turns back at the
door.

                         JORDAN
          Sir, I just want you to know... I'm
          not here to make a statement.  I
          don't want to make men look foolish.
          All I care about is completing the
          training and getting operational
          experience -- just like everyone
          else, I suspect.

                         C.O.
          If you were like everyone else,
          lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be
          making statements about not making
          statements, would we?
                  (a beat)
          Take your leave.


EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The Spec-Recon TRAINEES loiter outside their open rooms,
pumping weights, hosing down dive gear, trading Walkman
tapes.  This is the last day of liberty they'll have for a
long time.

                         MILLER
          What am I scannin' here?

Other eyes quickly lock in on...

Jordan.  Across a grass courtyard, she walks the ground
floor of an identical building, trying to match key number
to room number.  Every door is open, every room empty.
Soon she feels the presence of...

The men.  They're disgorging from their rooms -- ten,
twenty, thirty of them -- all buffed and cut.  These guys
are what Hitler saw in his dreams.

Jordan picks up her pace.  Where the hell is her room?

On all three levels of their building, the men shadow
Jordan en masse.  Not hooting.  Not leering.  Just
assessing.

Jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building:
She's got the entire floor to herself.  With a last look
over her shoulder, Jordan vanishes inside.


EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

                         C.O.
          Special Reconnaissance.  Here you
          will be trained to infiltrate
          hostile territory... to be the real-
          time eyes on the ground... to
          recover assigned targets and, if
          need be, to fight your way out under
          adverse conditions.

CAMERA SURVEYS faces of the trainees:  MILLER, MCCOOL,
SLUTNIK, CORTEZ, FLEA, STAMM, ENGLAND, NEWBERRY, WICKWIRE.
We'll get to know them later.  Dressed in Navy greens,
they stand in formation -- ten rows, ten deep, helmets in
hand.  Pacing before them:

                         C.O.
          That is all that will be said about
          the special nature of this class --
          by us or by you.  Many of you have
          waited years for admission to this
          program.  Opportunities like this
          are rare -- and those who seize upon
          them are rarer still.

He approaches Jordan.  We can tell what she's thinking.
"Just keep moving.  Don't single me out."

                         C.O.
          Other than that, there is little to
          be said but "Good luck, gentleman."
                  (correcting)
          "Gentlepersons."

Jordan flinches.

                         C.O.
          Now I turn you over to the chief
          training officer.  He has earned six
          naval commendations, the purple
          heart, and the Navy Cross for
          heroism and valor.  I give you
          Master Chief John James Urgayle.

Taking over, THE CHIEF stands before the class a moment,
sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him,
too:  His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50.
An ageless warrior.  Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs
in this guy's veins.

The Chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo --
and it's anything but the kick-ass rant the class is
expecting:

                         THE CHIEF
          The sun and moon... the ebb and flow
          of the Pacific tides... global
          warming... the very angle of the
          Earth upon its axis... these are
          just some of the things I control in
          my world.

Trainees swap private looks.

                         MCCOOL
          We're fucked.

                         SLUTNIK
          Darth Vader reads poetry...

                         MCCOOL
          We are so fucked.


EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - DAY

START on boots, crashing through shallow surf, spraying
water.  We assume this is a routine beach run -- until
VIEW RISES to reveal...

Telephone poles on their shoulder.  Working in groups of
10, trainees labor under 300-pound poles.  Jordan, six
inches shorter than most, looks like Atlas carrying the
weight of the world.  But she's doing it.

                         INSTRUCTOR
          Count down... one, two... count
          down... three, four...

                         CLASS CADENCE
          One, two, three, four... One, two,
          three, four...

An ambulance shadows the class.  Perched on the front
bumper like an hood-ornament, the Chief keeps working his
bullhorn:

                         THE CHIEF
          You may think that you are the
          brightest, the best, the strongest.
          I assure you, that is a total
          delusion on your part.  It is my job
          to show you just how weak human
          beings can truly be.  60 percent of
          you will not finish this course.
          How do I know?  Because that is an
          historical fact.

It's also intimidating shit.

                         THE CHIEF
          Poles down.

The earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp
sand.  Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh
batteries into his bullhorn.  He does it like a man
thumbing rounds into a shotgun.

                         THE CHIEF
          Now for the bad new:  I always like
          to get one quitter on the first day.
          And until I do, the first day does
          not end.  So look around right now
          -- go on, do it.  I wonder who it's
          gonna be...

He passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes.
INSTRUCTOR PYRO steps up.  He's the Chief's bulldog.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Down to BVDs!

The guys strip down to boxers.  Jordan settles for boxers
and jog bra.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Now face the Pacific... link arms...
          and take a stroll!

The class wades in.  The first wave takes Jordan's breath
away:  It's February, and the water is cold.  When they
move out of instructors' earshot:

                         STAMM
          What is it with the damn phone
          poles?  We sign up for Spec-Recon or
          GTE?

                         WICKWIRE
          Just trying to thin the herd.
          That's all they want to do right
          now.

Some of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on
a cheap wet T-shirt contest.  Jordan covers herself
instinctively -- and hates the instinct.  Modesty isn't
going to get her through this.

                         SLUTNIK
          Man.  Doesn't she know it's rude to
          point?

                         NEWBERRY
          Wow.  You see that girl?

                         WICKWIRE
          I got eyes, Newberry.

                         SLUTNIK
          One night.  Just one night in my
          room, she'd forget all about playin'
          commando.

                         ENGLAND
          Tone that shit down, Slutnik.  You
          heard with they said.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Out of the water!

The class breaks for the beach.

                         THE CHIEF
          Now make like sugar cookies and roll
          in the sand for me.

The trainees hit their bellies and roll.  Indeed, they
look like sugar cookies.

                         THE CHIEF
          Collect those poles, gentlemen.
          Still a lotta beachfront you haven't
          seen...

Groaning, the trainees grab poles.  Jordan's pole, wet
slips from their collective grasp...

And bangs Stamm's ankle.  He HOWLS through his teeth.

                         ENGLAND
          How bad?  Stamm?

                         JORDAN
          We better get a medic over --

                         STAMM
          No, goddamnit.  No.

                         INSTRUCTOR
          Up!  Up!  Up!  Up!

Stamm swallows the pain.  Poles go back on shoulders.
Looking like drunk centipedes, the class staggers off down
the beach.


EXT.  MUD PIT - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Wallowing in mud, the class does belly-busters, atomic
sit-ups -- and the sadistic reverse push-up, where
trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder
blades and push their crotches skyward.

                         THE CHIEF
          Pain is your friend.  You ally.  It
          will keep you awake in times of
          emergency... it will tell you when
          you are seriously injured... it will
          keep you angry and remind you to
          finish the job and get the hell
          home.  But you know the best thing
          about pain?

                         CLASS
          No, sir!

                         THE CHIEF
          It lets you know that you aren't
          dead yet.

Instructors roam, RASPING ORDERS, kicking students into
proper position.  Jordan struggles with the reverses.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Go regulation if you can't do the
          reverses, O'Neil.

She looks around.  A lot of the guys are having trouble
with the reverses, not just her.

                         JORDAN
          Thank you, sir.  But I like these
          just fine.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.

                         JORDAN
          I'll try anyway, sir.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          You'll try what we tell you to try,
          O'Neil.  Go regulation.

She switches to standard push-ups, her face disappearing
into the ooze with every downstroke.  Soon the Chief's
boots slosh into FRAME.  He's still looking for his human
sacrifice.

                         THE CHIEF
          Who's it gonna be.  I just wonder,
          who is it gonna be...


EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - SUNSET

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          On your belly... on your back... on
          your feet... on your belly... on
          your back... on your feet...

Whistle-drills.  Silhouetted against a lowering sun, the
students flop around like docked fish.


INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Blondell is ending her shift.  She shoulders a purse and
pauses at a window, seeing...

The trainees shuffling into formation like the living
dead.  Jordan is still among them.


EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

                         THE CHIEF
          You have noticed a ship's bell
          hanging at the west side of this
          courtyard.  If, at any time, you
          feel you cannot continue with your
          training -- that bell is your
          salvation.  Strike it three times,
          and the ordeal is over.

Nervous eyes flick to the bell.

                         THE CHIEF
          Yes, it is a long walk.  So I'll
          make it as easy as I can.

He turns his back to the class.

                         THE CHIEF
          Now you don't have to watch me
          watching you break rank.  Because I
          know someone here wants to do it.

CAMERA SEARCHES their faces.  There isn't one trainee here
who hasn't thought about it.  Including Jordan.

                         THE CHIEF
          Now I know what you're thinking...

                         SLUTNIK
                  (low)
          I'm thinkin' we could jump him right
          now...

                         THE CHIEF
          "Can I really take 15 weeks of this
          bubonic asshole?"  If you don't know
          the answer to that question, the
          answer is "No, you cannot."  And
          that is another historical fact.  So
          do it.  Admit you don't have what it
          takes... admit you are out of your
          depth -- or we're all heading back
          to the beach right now.
                  (waiting a beat)
          Instructors!  Time hack!

Following the Chief's lead, Instructors lift their dive
watches.

                         THE CHIEF
          Six... five... four... three...
          two... one... HACK!
                  (to class)
          The time is now 12-hundred.  The sun
          is shining brightly.  Plenty of
          daylight left for another phone-pole
          run...

GROANS behind him.  The groans give way to the SOUND OF
BOOTS breaking rank.


INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

BLONDELL'S POV:  Of a lone figure crossing to the bell.


EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

QUICK CLOSEUPS of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to
watch someone cross the grinder.  At least we know who it
isn't.

CLOSE on the Chief as the BELL RINGS THREE TIMES.  He
turns around to find...

Stamm at the bell.

For the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan.
Was he expecting her?

                         THE CHIEF
          Leave your helmet there, Stamm.
          Back to the barracks.

Stamm drops his helmet and limps away.

                         THE CHIEF
          The rest of you should remember one
          thing.  The only easy day was today.
          Lieutenant Wickwire?  Turning it
          over to you.

                         WICKWIRE
          Cuh-lass, face right!

They march off.


INT.  MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Dead-ass tired, Jordan slides her tray down the line,
piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories.
She heads for...

A table of trainees, one spot open.  Seeing her coming,
the guys shift position.  Suddenly the table is full.

                         ENGLAND
          Better look elsewhere, O'Neil.

Jordan glares.  None of them meet her eyes.  She wheels
around -- and now all eyes are on her, watching her ass
walk away.  FEATURE Slutnik, the walking sperm bank.

                         SLUTNIK
          Half a night, Lord, just gimme half
          a night to set her straight...

Jordan tries another table.  This one, too, becomes
abruptly full.  As Jordan leaves, HOLD on Miller.  He's a
human eclipse -- six-three, 220, the perfect commando
physique.  Instructors wish they could clone him.

                         MILLER
          Average woman is 25 percent body
          fat.  That's one-quarter fat, man.
          Think about that.

                         MCCOOL
          Nice distribution, though.

                         MILLER
          No way does she makes this program.
          No way.

After wandering the mess hall like a homeless person,
Jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards.
They look at her with blank faces.  No understanding.  No
compassion.


EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan walks in a bathrobe, toweling her hair dry.  She
fishes for keys at her door.

                         VOICE
          It's not so much that they hate
          you...

Jordan looks.  Someone is sitting on an outdoor table,
smoking.  He leans into the light so she can see his face.
It's Wickwire, the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class
officer.  He's dangerously handsome.

                         WICKWIRE
          They're more afraid of you.

                         JORDAN
          Well, now I feel so much better.

                         WICKWIRE
          It was made clear before you came --
          harassment equals career suicide.
          Can't say anything good, so they
          don't say much at all.  To your
          face, anyway.

                         JORDAN
          Whose orders were those?

                         WICKWIRE
          It was made clear.
                  (getting up)
          Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's
          hell, then it levels out.  Until
          S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's
          hell-and-a-half.

                         JORDAN
          And how do you know that?

                         WICKWIRE
          Made it to Week 10 last time.

                         JORDAN
          I didn't know they let you try
          again.  Especially at your age.

                         WICKWIRE
          You're kind of a surprise yourself.

A faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across
the courtyard that separates the two B.O.Q. buildings.
Back across no-man's land.


INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Two beds.  Matching lockers.  A desk, a chair, a mirror.
All overwhelmingly dull.

Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory
of her body.  Both sides of her neck are bruised from the
phone-pole run.  Her back and thighs are sand-burned.
Mirror cuts abound.  She's already a mess.

Jordan uncaps some cologne.  It's a vestige of her old
life she's not going to surrender.  She sniffs.  Savors.
Dabs.  Looks back in the mirror...

And breaks out laughing.  It's like dropping a rose in a
cesspool.


EXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - CORONADO - DAY

A PHOTOGRAPHER stands near a car parked just outside the
base.  He's peering through a 600mm lens.

PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV:  FOCUSING through cyclone fencing...
PANNING past the sand dunes... and finding green-clad
trainees gathered at an obstacle course.


EXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

An explosion of sand:  England and Wickwire belly-flop
into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire.  Clear,
they gain their feet and blitz toward...

The rolling logs.  They balance-beam their way to...

The rope climb.  Racing to the top, they reach a platform
and fling themselves down onto...

The high poles.  They land awkwardly, losing their wind
and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before...

Racing for the finish.  The Chief thumbs a stopwatch.

                         THE CHIEF
          England, 88 seconds.  You're good to
          go for the slide-for-life.
          Wickwire, roll back till you get
          south of 90.

                         WICKWIRE
          Fuck.  Yes sir.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Who'd you kiss to get back in here,
          anyway?

Wickwire dusts off and starts back for...

The starting line.  Stepping up next is Cortez, the human
fighting cock.  Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up
for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall.

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          Hang on, here...

He grabs something off a truck and positions it at the
base of the wall.  It's a little two-step platform.

SNICKERS, MOANS from the guys.  Cortez can barely contain
his disgust.

                         CORTEZ
          Aw, what is this...

                         JORDAN
                  (mortified)
          Sir...

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but
          it's gotta go out.
                  (calling out)
          Five... four... three...

                         JORDAN
          I can make this wall without --

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          ... two... one... MARK!

Cortez blurs away.  Jordan starts a step late.

Cortez takes the wall clean.  Eschewing the two-step,
Jordan jumps right over it -- but jumps too far out
because of it.  She takes the wall awkwardly.

INTERCUT the others as they break rank to follow, eager to
see Cortez blow her off the course.

                         CLASS
          Lesgo, Cortez, LESGO, GO, GO!

Cortez belly-flops into the sand pit -- and snags going
under the barbed wire.

                         CORTEZ
          Shit of a saint...

Catching up, Jordan clears the wire without a hitch and
leads going into...

The rolling logs.  They both tight-rope across nimbly and
bound on toward...

Rope climb.  Jordan starts up at a decent clip -- but
Cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar,
doubling her speed.

                         CLASS
          Take her, take her here, Cortez...
          lookit that monkey-man go... hoo-
          yah, hoo-yah...

Cortez reaches the top platform.  Now he's faced with...

The high poles.  He's seen others land sideways and pay
the price.  Trying another way, Cortez takes a flying
leap...

And WHUMPS down with legs astraddle.  He tried to cushion
the landing with his hands -- and failed magnificently.
His balls took the brunt.

Jordan WHUMPS down beside him with legs astraddle -- and
shoots Cortez a "Hey, no problem" look.  She rolls off the
poles...

And drops to the pit below.  Cortez lands right behind.
Now it's a flat-out sprint for...

The finish line.  He takes her at the tape.

                         THE CHIEF
          Cortez, 93 seconds.  O'Neil, 94.
          Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery
          on your gonads and line up again.
          O'Neil... move ahead.

Heading back to the starting line, Jordan wheels around.

                         JORDAN
          Say again, sir?

                         THE CHIEF
          You heard me.  Move on.

                         CORTEZ
          Aw, this is such bullshit...

Others GRUMBLE in commiseration.  Jordan flushes with
anger.

                         JORDAN
          Chief, sir, I don't understand
          why --

                         THE CHIEF
          Educate her, Pyro.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Automatic five-second deduction,
          which slips you under the wire.
          It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil
          -- standard procedure for all
          females in physical training
          courses.  Where you been the last
          few years?

                         JORDAN
          What "all females"?  If I'm the
          only --

                         THE CHIEF
          Twice now, I have said the words
          "move on."

He turns his back, leaving no possibility of discussion.
Jordan stares after.

                         SLUTNIK
          Can't live with them, can't kill
          them.  What's the point?

                         MCCOOL
          Somebody throw a tent over this
          circus.

                         WICKWIRE
                  (low to Jordan)
          Just let it go.  If it's in your
          favor, just shut the hell up and
          take it.


EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Dressed in bathrobe, Jordan reaches her door.  She pauses
to check...

The outdoor table.  No visitors tonight.


INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan pushes inside -- and stops when she sees the little
two-step platform.  That awful crutch.  Someone has put it
beside her bed.

Jordan wheels around to check...


EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

The men' building.  Slutnik and a few others loiter on a
balcony, mirroring her stare.


EXT.  CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Hastily dressed, Jordan marches across the base.  Her
march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking
lots... jumps hedges... and finally reaches...


EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

An on-base bungalow.  Jordan bangs on the front door until
the C.O.'S scowling face appears.

                         JORDAN
          Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told
          me to come to you immediately if I
          felt I was being mistreated in any
          way.

                         C.O.
          Didn't take long.

He waves her inside.


INT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

                         C.O.
          All right, lieutenant, give me a
          name and specifics, I'll have the
          X.O. file an action first thing in
          the morning.
                  (waits)
          A name?

                         JORDAN
          It's you, sir.  And it started the
          day I came here.

                         C.O.
                  (jolted)
          Oh, really.

                         JORDAN
          It's this double-standard, the
          separate quarters, the deferential
          treatment.  It's how you pulled out
          my chair and nearly served high tea
          the first time we met.

                         C.O.
          Because I was civil, now you're
          complaining.

                         JORDAN
          I can't afford civility, sir.  How
          am I supposed to fit in with these
          guys when you've got me set up as an
          outsider?  Even if I make it under
          these rules, I still lose, because
          there'll always be a flag in my file
          -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I
          mean, really -- why didn't you just
          issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear
          around the base?

                         C.O.
          Did you just have a brain-fart?

                         JORDAN
          Pardon?

                         C.O.
          Did you just barge in here and curse
          at your base commander?  If so, I
          regard that as a bonafide brain-
          fart, and I resent it when people
          fart inside my home.

                         JORDAN
          I think you've resented me from the
          start, sir.

Now, finally, her opponent steps into the ring.  And he's
a bare-knuckle brawler.

                         C.O.
                  (building)
          What I resent, lieutenant, is some
          politician using my base as a test
          tube for her grand social
          experiment.  What I resent is the
          sensitivity training that is now
          mandatory for my men... the day-care
          center I have to build where an
          officer's lounge used to be... and
          the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff
          just so someone can keep track of
          your personal pap smears.
                  (drawing close)
          But most of all, lieutenant, I
          resent your perfume, however subtle
          it may be, competing with the aroma
          of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty-
          nine cent cigar, which I will
          happily put out this very instant if
          the phallic nature of it happens to
          offend your goddamn fragile
          sensibilities.  DOES IT?

                         JORDAN
          No, sir.

                         C.O.
          No, sir, WHAT?

                         JORDAN
          The shape doesn't bother me.  It's
          just that goddamn rotten stench.

A dangerous beat -- before the C.O. disengages.

                         C.O.
          Well.  'Least now we're talking the
          same language.
                  (a beat)
          So one standard.  Is that what
          you're after?

                         JORDAN
          Same rules for everyone, sir.

                         C.O.
          Straight up?

                         JORDAN
          Across the board, sir.

                         C.O.
          And if you just happen to wash out,
          I won't have to contend with you
          bitchin' to some hairy-chested
          female Senator?  And please note I
          did not identify any one in
          particular.

                         JORDAN
          Wouldn't dream of it, sir.

A deciding beat.

                         C.O.
          Then good night.

                         JORDAN
          So I'll get a fair shot?

                         C.O.
          You'll get everything you want,
          O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what
          you're gonna get.


INT.  BARBER SHOP - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan gets her hair cut to regulation length.  It's over
in seconds.


INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan slaps down old room keys and new orders.  Blondell
scans the paperwork with deepening concern.

                         BLONDELL
          This some kind of joke?


INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan tosses her belongings into a laundry bag.  She
slings the bag over her shoulder, boots aside the hated
two-step on her way out...


EXT.  B.O.Q. BUILDING - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

... marches across the no-man's land...


INT.  B.O.Q. ROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

... and bangs open a door.  Slutnik sits up on his bed.

                         SLUTNIK
          Well, who the shit you think you
          are?  Comin' in here like that?

                         JORDAN
          Your new roommate.

Slutnik's face curdles.  Jordan dumps her bag on an open
bunk and starts unpacking.

                         JORDAN
          Anybody usin' these drawers here?

                         SLUTNIK
          Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You
          can't stay in here.  You can't sleep
          right next to me.

                         JORDAN
          Funny, the C.O. says I can.

She slaps orders on his chest, continues to unpack.

                         SLUTNIK
          Aw, lookit this, lookit this --
          she's bringin' Tampax in here.
          C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms
          over there.

                         JORDAN
          That your desk?  I'll take this one.

                         SLUTNIK
          WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?

                         JORDAN
                  (whirling on him)
          Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay.
          And if you don't want me for a
          roommate or classmate, you got two
          options -- move out or ring out.
          End of file.

Slutnik stalks out.  Jordan fires a look at the innocent
bystander here, McCool.  He was studying at his desk when
the fireworks began.

                         JORDAN
          What about you, McCool?  Any problem
          with the room assignment?

McCool -- an imperturbable black lieutenant -- just goes
back to his manuals.

                         MCCOOL
          "It's not a job -- it's an

START on flares igniting overhead.  FOLLOW the flares as
they parachute down into the surf to illuminate...

The class, standing in one long line, arms linked.  As
black waves knock out their legs, we're reminded of show
girls kicking their way through some macabre review.


EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Firing flare guns and working their bullhorns:

          58 degrees this morning!  That's not
          a bad water temp, really -- if

The class pivots 90 degrees and starts to close rank.
Behind Jordan, Montgomery (a.k.a. "Flea") hesitates:
He's a bantam-weight from Georgia, his manners bred into
the bone.  He just can't find a delicate way to grab
Jordan without mounting her.

                         JORDAN
          Just do it, okay?

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          If you can't feel the other guy's
          pecker, you ain't in tight enough!
          I want nuts to butts!

                         JORDAN
          Come on, Montgomery...

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break
          in that line?

Finally Jordan grabs Flea by the neck, pushes him ahead
and mounts him.  The class closes down into a long human
snake.

                         JORDAN
                  (in his ear)
          Montgomery, why do they call you
          "Flea"?

                         FLEA
          It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" --
          but that gets whittled down to just
          "Flea."  For short, ma'am.

                         JORDAN
          So it really has nothing to do with
          actual brain size?

                         FLEA
          No, ma'am.

                         JORDAN
          Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect
          you just showed me.  But I don't
          need it and don't want it -- not
          that kind of respect, anyway.  It's
          just gonna hurt us both, okay?

                         FLEA
          I'll work on it, ma'am.

                         JORDAN
          Do that.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
                  (to the Chief)
          Time.

                         THE CHIEF
          Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.

CAMERA POLLS the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water.
Jordan feels Flea starting to shake.  Badly.

                         JORDAN
          Hey.  You okay, Flea?

                         FLEA
          'Snot me.  It's him.

Two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's
shuddering.  Jordan feels him shaking through Flea.

                         MILLER
          Jesus, my hands... they aren't
          workin' right...

                         NEWBERRY
          How long i'zis for?

                         WICKWIRE
          'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals,
          no more.

                         NEWBERRY
          Swear each time's gettin' longer.

                         MCCOOL
          This where you bailed last time,
          Wick?

                         WICKWIRE
          Huh-uh -- but wasn't middla February
          last time, either.

                         FLEA
          How you doin', Miller?  Miller?

No answer.  Bad sign.  On shore:

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          22 minutes...

Ignoring, the Chief lifts his bullhorn:

                         THE CHIEF
          Remember, all this is completely
          voluntary.  For any of you who don't
          want to continue, Instructor Johns
          is now serving coffee and danish at
          the ambulance.

A portable light comes on.  Indeed, an instructor is
setting up coffee service.

                         THE CHIEF
          Any takers?

                         SLUTNIK
          He's the fuckin' Antichrist.

                         MCCOOL
          Wick!  They really got donuts over
          there?  Or just some'a last night's
          dinner rolls?

                         FLEA
          Look like donuts to me...

                         JORDAN
                  (in disbelief)
          What're you guys doing?  Huh?

                         MCCOOL
          Just askin'

                         JORDAN
          What, you gonna give it all up for a
          maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be?
          That's exactly what they --

Suddenly the line rips apart.  It's Miller, breaking for
shore.

                         CLASS
          NO!

Soon the dyke is bursting everywhere:  Four others break
rank, following Miller's lead.

The deserters stagger onto the beach.  MEDICS close in
quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in
their faces, asking brain-check question.

                         MEDICS
          Tell me what day this is... look at
          me now... what city are you from,
          sailor... here, look right here...

A medic nods to the Chief.  No hypothermia.  Not yet.

                         THE CHIEF
          You want another minute to think
          about this?  Huh?
                  (no response; to
                   Miller directly)
          Do any of you want to reconsider?

Avoiding his eyes, Miller wags his head.

                         THE CHIEF
          Johnson.  Get 'em out of my scan.

It's a death sentence.  As the quitters slouch for the
coffee truck...

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          By my watch... which, of course
          appears to be broken... they've been
          in 27 minutes without the benefit of
          protective gear.

TIGHT on the Chief.  Scanning the remaining trainees.
Thinking about holding out out for one more.

TIGHT on Jordan.  Knowing who he's waiting for.  Wondering
if she can outlast him.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (into bullhorn)
          Everybody out.

With a SHIVERING CHEER, the trainees stampede ashore,
grabbing blankets, trading body-bumps and high-fives.
Jordan gets swept up in the esprit:  They've conquered a
common enemy.  But when she tries to get high-fived...

The guys turn their backs.  It's a cold rebuff, worse then
any water.

HOLD TIGHT on Jordan.  Shivering.  Watching the guys drift
away.  Hating them.

                         WICKWIRE
          Hey.  Way to gut it out.

                         JORDAN
          Thanks, Wick.


INT.  INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The instructors are shuffling muster lists, reorganizing
the class.  B.G., the BELL TOLLS again and again.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
                  (shaking head)
          Miller.  Thought the guy was made of
          depleted uranium.  Really didn't
          expect to lose him.

                         THE CHIEF
          Every class has its surprises, Pyro.
          This one'll be no different.


EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign,
tall and striking.  Passing the bell, Blondell checks
on...

The helmets lined up beneath.  A dozen already.

An O.S. CADENCE CALL -- then, led by Wickwire, trainees
double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a
beach run.  Among them, still, is Jordan.  It brings a
Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Change those clothes, be back here
          in six minutes!  And I am timing
          you!

The class scatters.  Slutnik hits the brakes when he sees
Blondell and her friend.

                         SLUTNIK
          Jesus Christ.  And I only got three
          minutes apiece...

                         ENGLAND
                  (jerking him away)
          Barkin' up the wrong dress, Slutnik.
          You ain't their type.

Overhearing, Jordan snaps a look at Blondell, only now
realizing.  Their eyes meet.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          O'Neil!  What're you gawking at?


INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

                         P.R. FLAK
                  (reading newspaper)
          "... last week at Coronado.  The
          woman, identity unknown, is believed
          to be the first female candidate for
          the elite Special Reconnaissance
          program.  Her presence could signal
          a shift in the Navy's long-standing
          policy that excludes women from
          combat positions."

The P.R. FLAK drops the newspaper on the C.O.'s desk.
It's the San Diego Tribune.  Under the headline "G.I.
JANE," a photo shows a chesty sailor running the obstacle
course.

                         C.O.
                  (calling O.S.)
          I'm asking again.  Where is she?

                         YEOMAN
          Inbound now, sir.  Had to pull her
          out of the dive bell.

                         P.R. FLAK
          I have interview requests from two
          local TV stations.  And a
          sociologist from U.C. San Diego
          called, wanted to know if she could
          examine the interaction between
          "G.I. Jane" and the men.

                         C.O.
          "A sociol..."  Kill the interviews.
          I don't need civilians nosin' around
          in matters that are supposed to be
          covert in nature.  Just kill 'em
          before this whole thing gets outta
          con --

                         YEOMAN
          Senator DeHaven calling, sir.

The C.O. gets an instant headache.


INT.  SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

                         C.O. (V.O.)
          Base Commander Turrentine speaking.

In the Senate barber shop, DeHaven is having her hair
colored.  She holds a fax of the Tribune article in one
hand, a cell phone in the other.

                         DEHAVEN
                  (hitting like a Scud)
          Commander, are you of the habit of
          letting photographers traipse around
          your base snappin' their fill?
          These were supposed to have been
          discreet test cases --

INTERRCUTTING:

                         C.O.
          Senator, they stand out on the
          public highway with telephoto
          lenses --

                         DEHAVEN
          -- and now I got reporters from
          Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office
          and askin' what I know about this
          "G.I. Jane" thing.

                         C.O.
          -- nothing I can do about it unless
          you're suggesting I infringe on
          their civil liberties -- which I'd
          happily do if you'll just trim a
          little fat off the Constitution.

                         DEHAVEN
          Are you truly mouthin' off to a
          senior member of the Senate Arms
          Committee?  I mean, I'll give you
          points for style -- just nothin' for
          smarts.


INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The C.O. double-takes as Jordan enters:  She's sun-burned,
wind-burned, sand-burned, chapped and chaffed, bloody and
soggy.  Her dive suit leaks onto the floor.

                         JORDAN
          See me, sir?

                         C.O.
          You makin' friends with the press,
          lieutenant?

He tosses her the paper.  Jordan scans the article as
DeHaven continues over speakerphone:

                         DEHAVEN
          Well, seein's how this thing is out,
          you let me handle the r.p.m.  From
          this point forward, I want all press
          matters coordinated via my office.
          I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna
          watch Hayes pull flowers out of his
          ass and take credit for this one.
          Him or the President.
                  (aside to beautician)
          This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"?
          'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to
          lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.

                         C.O.
          Your prerogative, Senator.

                         DEHAVEN
          Awright.  How's our girl doin',
          anyway?

                         C.O.
          Standing right here in my office.

                         DEHAVEN
          Jordan, dear.  How are they treating
          you?

                         JORDAN
                  (catching C.O.'s
                   eyes)
          Can't complain, ma'am.

                         DEHAVEN
          Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you
          in person.

                         JORDAN
          Uh, ma'am.

                         DEHAVEN
          Gonna be visiting that all-woman's
          America's cup team in a few weeks --
          If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis
          O'Conner's days are numbered.  But
          they're in San Diego, so I thought
          I'd take a quick promenade of the
          base.

Deafening silence.  We aren't sure who dreads the idea
more -- the C.O. or Jordan.

                         C.O.
          Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements
          generally take some time, Senator.

                         DEHAVEN
          "Security"?  What the hell you
          talkin' about?  Your base isn't
          secure?

                         C.O.
          Of course, but there's more --

                         DEHAVEN
          Then set out the good plates, we'll
          all have lunch.  My office will
          follow up with details.  Jumping
          off, now...

Phone goes dead.  The C.O. gives Jordan a look one might
reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed
Ebola upon the world.

                         JORDAN
          Sir, I want you to know that I had
          nothing to do with any of this.  Not
          this article, not --

                         C.O.
          "We'll all have lunch."  Good idea.
          Oh, and let's be sure to invite this
          sociologist, too -- just in case we
          want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME
          AFTERWARDS!

                         YEOMAN
          Sir?  Secretary Hayes calling.

The C.O.'s headache becomes a migraine.

                         JORDAN
                  (backing out)
          Permission to leave, sir?

                         C.O.
          Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.


INT.  SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

DeHaven hands the phone to her aide.  He's set up a
portable office in the next barber chair.

                         DEHAVEN
          Think I overplayed it?

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE
          Congress and the Pentagon share a
          lot of plumbing.  They'll never know
          whose leak it is.


EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

150-pound rubber boats ("Zodiacs") litter the beach.  The
class is breaking down into six-man crews.

                         THE CHIEF
          Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl,
          Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise.
          Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior
          officer.  Follow his orders to your
          death.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Get it up!

Crew Five finds their Zodiac, hoists it onto their heads.

                         THE CHIEF
          Boat Six -- England, O'Neil, McCool,
          Montgomery, Cortez, and Slutnik.
          Lieutenant England is your senior
          officer.

Jordan rolls her eyes:  At least two of the guys in her
crew are blue-ribbon misogynists.  Cortez and Slutnik
don't like it any better.

                         JORDAN
          Ah, c'mon...

                         CORTEZ
          Motherachrist...

                         SLUTNIK
          Me?  Again?

                         THE CHIEF
                  (looking up)
          Somebody got a problem with the
          muster?

                         JORDAN
          Fine by me, sir!

                         CORTEZ
          No problem, sir!

                         SLUTNIK
          Full of joy here, sir!

Exchanging looks across their Zodiac, Jordan and her new
crewmates lift the boat overhead.

                         THE CHIEF
          Boat Seven...


EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

With BATTLE CRIES, 12 boat crews charge into the teeth of
the POUNDING SURF.  Some lose their boat to the first
wave; others clear the surf and scramble aboard.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
                  (into bullhorn)
          First crew to finish gets hot food
          and warm racks for the night!  Rest
          of you are digging hide-sites and
          eating earthworms tonight!


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Beyond the breakers, the Zodiacs run parallel to shore,
crews paddling furiously, racing the wind, the sun, the
other crews.  Instructors shadow in power boats,
stopwatches running.


EXT.  BOAT SIX - OCEAN - DAY

                         McCool
          Don't wanna be pickin' no sandcrabs
          outta my ass tonight!

                         ENGLAND
          So shutup and stroke, McCool!

                         SLUTNIK
          Hoo-yah!  Hoo-yah!

Flea checks on Jordan.  She paddles hard, really digging
in.  Flea grins:  On some level, he has to admire this
women.

Jordan catches the grin, gives one back.

Ahead, buoys mark the finish line.  And just when it seems
victory is at hand...

THWUNK.  Something hits Boat Six.  Suddenly it's losing
air.  Jordan torques around to see...

The Chief on a nearby boat, speargun in hand.

                         THE CHIEF
          Your boat just hit razor coral.
          What do you do now?

                         ENGLAND
          Patch and pump!  C'mon!  Whose ass
          is on the kit?

                         MCCOOL
          I say keep paddlin'!  We're
          almost --

                         ENGLAND
          Forget it, McCool!  Pri One is to
          save the boat, not win a race!  So
          let's get on it!

They flail to save their sinking boat.  Boat Five noses
past, stealing the lead.  Wickwire tosses Jordan a passing
look.  "Sorry, but..."


EXT.  UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Up and down the dunes, crews are digging "hide-sites" --
six-man holes that will be their homes tonight.  Cortez
and Slutnik are uprooting shrubs, collecting camouflage
material.

                         CORTEZ
          Four years I petition to get into
          this program.  Four years.  Finally
          get here, and now it's co-ed?  Such
          bullshit.  Now I'm gettin' hammered
          just 'cuz she's on our crew.

                         SLUTNIK
          Least you don't have to sleep with
          her every goddamn night.

                         CORTEZ
          Tellin' you, I'd rather be the last
          class with balls than the first one
          with chicks.

EXT.  UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan and Flea fill sand bags to shore up the walls of
their hide-site.  England and McCool shovel back to back.

                         MCCOOL
          Had a grandaddy who wanted to be a
          Navy man.  Wanted to fire them big
          guns on a big-ass battleship.  But
          Navy said to him, "Oh, no.  You can
          only do one thing on a battleship."
          "Well what's that?" grandaddy said.
          "Cook," they said.  Now this ain't
          100 years ago -- I'm talkin' United
          States Navy, middla World War II.
          And you know the reason they gave
          him?  You know why they tol' my
          grandaddy he couldn't fight for his
          country?

                         ENGLAND
          He talked too much?

                         MCCOOL
          "Negroes can't see at night.  Bad
          night vision."

                         JORDAN
          You're kiddin' me.

Jordan jumps in the hole, ready to take over shoveling.

                         MCCOOL
          See, you just the new nigger on the
          block, O'Neil.  That's all.  And
          maybe you moved in too early.

He climbs out.  HOLD on Jordan, looking off down the
dunes, seeing the other crews covering up and going
underground for the night.  How the hell did she wind up
here?  So far from home?


EXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - DAY

A Jeep speeds along the public highway, carrying the C.O.
back to base.  When the Jeep tops a rise:

                         C.O.
          What in God's name...

Ahead, a half-dozen news crews are camped on the shoulder.
All cameras are trained on the base.


INT.  BEDROOM - GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

          denying the presence of at least one
          female in a heretofore all-male
          program.  Dubbed "G.I. Jane" by the
          media, this woman is now undergoing
          commando training at the Special
          Warfare Command Center in San
          Diego...

Half-shaven, Royce leans out of the bathroom in time to
catch...

          Senator DeHaven's office still has

INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Beneath the coffered ceiling of a great Beau-Art hall, one
of Washington's power-tribes is celebrating.  We find
gowned women, tuxedoed men, gold-braided naval officers, a
SWING BAND, and...

Secretary Hayes, newly confirmed.  He beams as he dances
with his wife.  Compliments and friendly barbs come from
all directions:

                         COMPLIMENTS (O.S.)
          Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.  Say
          hello to the President for me...
          Maybe now you can change that carpet
          in your office, Teddy... So what was
          the deal you made with DeHaven?  Or
          was it the Devil?  Always get them
          confused...

                         HAYES
          Didn't you hear?  Effective
          immediately, all navy vessels can no
          longer be referred to as "she."

BRAYS of laughter.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Royce, EXCUSING his way through the crowd, fixating on the
bar, leading his DIAL-A-DATE winner by the hand.
Conversations drift into earshot:

                         VOICE #1
          ... women are child-bearers.  Life-
          givers.  Now we're going to make
          them killers?

                         VOICE #2
          ... just don't have the upper-body
          strength...

                         VOICE #3
          How strong do you need to be to
          launch a rocket?  To push a button
          or pull a trigger?

Royce can't get away from it.

                         DIAL-A-DATE
          Are we going to dance?

                         ROYCE
          Not right now.

Just yards from the bar, a Pentagon E-RINGER snags Royce's
elbow.

                         E-RINGER
          Commander Royce.  How's life across
          the river?

                         ROYCE
          Little slow, sir.  When's the
          Pentagon going to send me a good
          crisis?

                         E-RINGER
          I'll check my out-basket in the
          morning.  Say, do you know...

The E-Ringer turns to make introductions -- but finds his
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS embroiled in the topic du jour:

                         CIRCLE #1
          ... but men have trained as athletes
          for 5,000 years.  Women have been at
          it for, what, couple of decades?  Do
          we really know the limits of their
          strength?

                         CIRCLE #2
          Or their endurance?  You know, 30
          years ago, women marathoners were 90
          minutes off the pace of the men.
          Now, the women's time is probably
          only 20 minutes off.

                         CIRCLE #1
          Try 15.

                         CIRCLE #3
          But what do female soldiers really
          contribute?  I mean, why is this
          "G.I. Jane" there instead of a man?

Eyes drift to Royce, inviting him into the fray.

                         ROYCE
                  (to dial-a-date)
          You wait right here.  I'll get the
          drinks.


INT.  MEZZANINE - BEAU-ART HALL - NIGHT

Heading upstairs with an iceless rum.  Royce finds a calm
and secluded place to get drunk in peace and quiet.

                         VOICE #1
          Take my word for it.  It's just not
          going to happen.  Not now, not
          anytime soon.

                         VOICE #2
          You're guaranteeing that?

Royce frowns:  He thought he was alone.  He tracks the
voices to a forced-air vent beside the chaise.

                         VOICE #1
          I have it on unorthodox but reliable
          authority that combat positions will
          remain off-limits.  Despite what's
          happening with our Babe in Boyland.

Alarms go off in Royce's head.  He moves quickly to a
railing, looks down.

ROYCE'S POV:  Of two naval officers on the floor below.
They stand beside a matching vent.  It's impossible to see
faces from this angle -- but one man has a distinct bald
spot.

                         NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)
          Well, isn't that what these test
          cases are supposed to decide?
                  (thinking)
          Unless, of course, you're suggesting
          that "G.I. Jane" is on her way to
          becoming "Jane Doe"...

                         BALD SPOT (VOICE #2)
          All I'm saying is that we won't be
          integrating -- despite the rhetoric
          coming off Capitol Hill, despite
          what's happening in Coronado.  And
          you did not hear it from me.

                         NAVAL OFFICER (VOICE #1)
          Hear what?

A conspiratorial handshake.  The men split up.


INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Royce flashes down the stairs.  Hitting main floor, he
looks around and then bumps into...

                         DIAL-A-DATE
          There you are.  Can we please dance
          now?

Over her shoulder, Royce spies Bald Spot heading for the
cloak room.  Royce commandeers the nearest J.O.

                         ROYCE
          Lieutenant!

                         J.O.
          Yes sir?

                         ROYCE
          Take a dance!


INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Royce bobs and weaves through the crowd, trying to keep
sight of...

Bald Spot.  Pushing through the exit doors.

Only steps behind, Royce shoulders through the doors...


EXT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

And blasts outside, intending to shake some answers out of
Bald Spot.  But here Royce finds...

A dozen naval officers waiting for their cars.  All of
them now wear caps.

Royce tries to check faces of the quickly departing men.
but it could have been anyone.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

A high-speed transport ("Seafox") is SLAMMING OVER SWELLS.
Lashed to one side is a rubber life boat.


EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY

                         THE CHIEF
          Crew Six!  Stand by!

                         ENGLAND
          Flea!  'Cool!  O'Neil!  Cortez!
          Slutnik!  In that order!  Five-
          second intervals!  Let's go!

England's crew lines up for cast-and-recover drills:  One
by one, they speed-roll off the transport...

... and drop into the life boat.  After quickly
stabilizing, they roll off the life boat...

... and disappear underwater like human bullets.  England
is last to cast off.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Jordan resurfaces.  Treading water, she scans for...

Seafox.  It makes a hard turn in the water and starts
back.  The recovery rig -- a big flexible loop -- is
lowered into position.

Still hauling ass, Seafox picks up the trainees in reverse
order -- England, Slutnik, Cortez.  They each stab an arm
through the passing loop...


EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY

... and vault back aboard, slick as hell.

                         CORTEZ
          Hoo-yah!  Better'n sex in a car
          crash!

But now they're bearing down fast on...


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Jordan.  She braces as best she can.  As SEAFOX THUNDERS
past, she stabs for the loop...

And snags it with her hand.  But only her hand.

Hanging on grimly, Jordan drags face down in torrential
water.  Her mouth gropes for clean air but can't find it.
If she doesn't let go soon, she'll drown.


EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY

At the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the
boat's wake.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (to pilot)
          Next recovery!  Keep goin', keep
          goin'!


EXT.  OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

COUGHING up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward
McCool and Flea.  They make textbook recoveries.  She's
the only one who couldn't cut it.


INT.  WOMEN'S SHOWERS - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Head hung, Jordan showers alone.

                         THE CHIEF (O.S.)
          You know, the Israelis...

Jordan recoils.  Christ, how long has he been there?  Just
standing in the doorway?

                         THE CHIEF
          ... they tried women in the 1967
          War.  Female soldiers.

With forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds a
towel.

                         JORDAN
          Permission to get dressed, sir?

                         THE CHIEF
          It seems the men couldn't get used
          to the sight of women blown open and
          their viscera hanging from tree
          limbs.  Israeli men would linger
          over wounded females -- often to the
          detriment of the mission, often
          endangering their own lives.  They
          don't use women anymore.

                         JORDAN
                  (moving closer)
          Sir, someone mentioned you received
          the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you
          got it for?

                         THE CHIEF
          For pulling a 210-pound man out of a
          burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.

                         JORDAN
          I see.  So when a man tries to
          rescue another man, he's a hero.
          But when he tries to rescue a woman,
          he's gone soft.

                         THE CHIEF
          Could you have pulled that 210-pound
          man clear, lieutenant?

She can't say yes.  She wants to but can't.

                         THE CHIEF
          Females in combat situations impact
          unit cohesion.  Men fight better
          without women around.  And that is
          an historical fact.

                         JORDAN
          It also seems like a problem with
          the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe
          you should be sniffing around their
          shower room instead.

She shoulders past.  The Chief gives her a few steps
before dropping his bomb:

                         THE CHIEF
          England went out with a stress
          fracture.  That puts you in charge,
          lieutenant.

                         JORDAN
                  (off-balance)
          McCool's that same rank.  We're both
          j.g.'s.

                         THE CHIEF
          You were commissioned one month
          earlier, which makes you the senior
          officer.
                  (passing her on his
                   way out)
          Remember.  There are no bad crews --
          only bad leaders.


INT.  ARTILLERY RANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Trainees are getting familiar with M-60 machine guns,
firing SHORT BURST at downfield targets.

                         CORTEZ
                  (pissed)
          No operational experience, and now
          she's callin' the shots?
          Unbelievable.

                         SLUTNIK
          Suppose she'll wanna eat with us
          now...

Jordan overhears them BITCHING.  She steps up to an open
slot -- and proceeds to WAIL AWAY with her M-60, tracer
rounds blazing.  Her target vaporized, she keeps WAILING
madly, taking out Slutnik's target... then Cortez's...
then...

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          O'Neil... O'Neil... O'NEIL!

Finally she stops.

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          One burst, one body, O'Neil!  What
          the fuck you trying to do?  Spell
          your name?
                  (to class)
          You are not infantry!  Your
          firepower is limited!  Excessive
          killing only risks compromise...

Reloading, Jordan tosses a look at Slutnik and Cortez.
Ain't nobody bitchin' now.


EXT.  MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

                         BLONDELL (O.S.)
          S.E.R.E. training coming up.

Eating at a table with other women, Jordan turns to see
Blondell setting down her tray.

                         BLONDELL
          They take you away to San Clemente
          Island.  Half the guys quit when
          they come back.  Supposed to be just
          hell-and-a-half.

                         JORDAN
          That's what I hear.

                         BLONDELL
          Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant?
          How come you're doing this?  I mean,
          we're kinda curious.

                         JORDAN
          Who's "we"?

                         BLONDELL
          Just some of the women.

          I don't know if there's any single
          reason.  But my father was Navy.
          And he had this old-time recruiting
          poster in his den.  It showed a girl
          trying on a sailor's uniform while
          saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man!
          I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10
          years old when I first saw it, and
          even then it felt wrong.  Made me
          mad.  And I don't think a month has
          gone by that I haven't thought about
          that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a
          man."

                         BLONDELL
          I've been accused of that wish.

                         JORDAN
          The woman I saw you with...

                         BLONDELL
          Just a friend.  We have friends,
          too, you know.

                         JORDAN
          But are there... I mean, how many...

                         BLONDELL
          More than you'd guess.  It's just
          that we don't hold coffee klatches.
          If more then three of us get
          together at any one time, the guys
          think it's some kind of uprising.

They laugh.

                         BLONDELL
          Sounds funny now, but it's really
          not.  We have to be careful.  The
          Navy still knows how to put on a
          witch-hunt.

Reaching the quarterdeck, they scan a message board.
Jordan finds a half-dozen phone slips for her.

                         JORDAN
          Royce...


INT.  GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

                         ROYCE
                  (into phone)
          I've been trying you for five days.
          Don't they give you messages?

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
          It's hard to find time to sleep,
          Royce.  Much less keep up with my
          phone life.

                         ROYCE
          How hard they making it on you?


EXT.  PHONE KIOSK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan sighs and slumps against the phone kiosk.  Where to
start?

                         ROYCE (V.O.)
          That bad?

                         JORDAN
          I feel like there's men here,
          there's women here -- then there's
          men.  But hey, what'd I expect?

INTERCUTTING Jordan and Royce:

                         ROYCE
          Well, not this.  I was doing the
          Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got
          some fresh stuff -- about you.  You
          may be in a hostile camp.  I think
          someone may be taking steps to
          ensure that you crash and burn.

                         JORDAN
          Me?  Why me?

                         ROYCE
          Don't you know?  How they're talking
          about you?

                         JORDAN
          I saw an article...

                         ROYCE
          I can't walk two blocks in
          Washington without hearing about
          "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the
          place, and whether you wanted it or
          not, the feminists are sizing you up
          for that poster.

Jordan's face sours with an errant thought.

                         JORDAN
          So why are you telling me this?

                         ROYCE
          Big symbols make big targets,
          Jordan.  I think someone's gunning
          for you.

                         JORDAN
          You know, Royce, I got enough heat
          on me without you turning up the
          jets, too.

                         ROYCE
          I'm only trying to warn you in
          case --

                         JORDAN
          Well, let me warm you:  I'm going
          though with this.  The more
          everybody fucks with me, fucks with
          my head, the more it just makes me
          want to finish.  So don't expect me
          back crying in your arms any time
          soon, okay?

                         ROYCE
          That's not what I want, Jordan.  I
          mean... it is and it isn't...

                         JORDAN
          Still can't make up your mind, huh?
          Gotta go, Royce.

                         ROYCE
          Jordan.  You watch your ass.

                         JORDAN
          Sure.  I'll join the crowd.


EXT.  AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

A HELO WARMS UP on its pad.

Crew Six approaches, garbed in black wetsuits, loaded down
with weapons and rucksacks.  Jordan is at the lead.


INT.  HELO - NIGHT

The helo is airborne.  Sitting on rucksacks, trainees
slather their faces with green camouflage paint.  Over the
HOWLING ROTORS:

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Infiltrate... establish your hide-
          site... record any movement of
          troops, vehicles, patrols -- any
          activity inside your scan.  If you
          are compromised, you have two
          options!  Newberry!

Newberry is the new sixth man.  He's young enough to still
have a hyperactive Adam's apple.

                         NEWBERRY
          Evasive maneuvers or radio for
          emergency extraction, sir!

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          If you are extracting, be damn sure
          to follow procedures you have
          learned in your classroom training!
          A helo cannot extract you from a
          wooded area!  You must bring it down
          in a clearing!  What's the minimum
          clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk,
          McCool?

                         MCCOOL
          32 feet, six inches, sir!

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          You will be penalized for early
          extraction, but you will be
          penalized more for capture -- trust
          me, far more!  Survival!  Evasion!
          Rescue!  Evacuation!  Welcome to
          S.E.R.E.!


EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

The helo swoops low over the water, moon silhouetting.
Black figures helo-cast into the ocean.


INT.  HELO - NIGHT

Last out, Jordan is poised to follow when...

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Lieutenant!  Don't back down!

Jordan looks back.  "What the hell does that mean?"
Offering no elaboration, Pyro signals "GO!"  Jordan
springs clear...


EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

... and knifes into black water.

The HELO PATTERS away.

An inky stillness overtakes the world.

Jordan activates a red-light beacon, sweeps it around,
revealing her position to...

Her crew.  Five black faces regroup around her.

                         SLUTNIK
          Feel right at home, McCool?

They secure weapons atop their waterproof rucksacks.
Jordan checks a heat-bearing compass.

                         JORDAN
                  (nodding direction)
          South-southeast.  And I don't want
          to hear another word till we're
          underground.

Pushing rucksacks ahead of them, they start swimming
towards...

A moonlit shoreline.  Half-mile ahead.


EXT.  ROCKY SHORELINE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT

Jordan's crew reaches shallow water.  They deflate their
vests and rucksacks.  Jordan trades her face mask for
night-vision goggles.

NIGHT-VISION POV:  Sweeping the rocks.  Nothing at first.
Then two "hostiles" appear, patrolling the rocks.

Jordan motions "down."  Six faces sink from sight.

NIGHT-VISION/UNDERWATER POV:  Of the "hostile" patrol
moving on.

They resurface.  On Jordan's cue, the crew sheds flippers
and begins scaling rocks.  They've made landfall.


EXT.  HIDE-SITE MONTAGE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT

MONTAGE:  Racing the coming sun, Jordan's crew builds
their hide-site... digging feverishly... filling sand
bags... telescoping open a roof pole, fanning out spars...
laying canvas roof panels into place... camouflaging the
panels... sprinkling sanitizing powder around the
perimeter to ward off animals.  INTERCUT WITH...

A snake slithering across the ground.  As it nears the
hide-site...

A knife whacks its head off.

Slutnik picks up the carcass, kicks dirt over the severed
head.  No trace.


EXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

CAMERA PANS the island, awash in morning light.  Woodlands
lie distant.  A road is the only man-made feature -- until
in FOREGROUND, we find a spotting scope poking from the
ground.


INT.  HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

SCOPE POV:  Of the road.  Fast-attack vehicles approach.

                         MCCOOL
                  (peering into scope)
          Got two FAVs moving south.  I
          make... four banditos aboard,
          carrying... H-60 machine guns...

Jordan REPEATS THE INFO into a digital tape-recorder, adds
the time.

                         JORDAN
          Newberry, get a photo.  South?

                         CORTEZ
          Entering my scan now...

                         JORDAN
          West?

                         SLUTNIK
          Clear.

                         JORDAN
          North?

                         FLEA
          Clear.

SCOPE POV:  Of the FAVs disappearing down the road.

                         CORTEZ
          FAVs clear.

Everyone relaxes -- as much as six people can in a hole
five feet-wide.  McCool opens up MREs (Meals Ready to Eat)
Slutnik guts his snake.

                         MCCOOL
          You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.

                         SLUTNIK
          So am I.

Cortez finishes pissing into a tin pot.  He transfers the
waste to a zip-lock baggy, offers the pot.

                         CORTEZ
          Anyone?

He looks at Jordan.  She eyes the pot, tempted and nettled
at the same time.

                         FLEA
          Don't wanna evacuate 'cuz someone
          came down with uric poisoning, el-
          tee.

Abruptly Jordan unzips, drops her pants, sticks the pot
under her.  It raises eyebrows:  It's a far cry from when
she was covering up in cold water.

                         JORDAN
          Didn't even bitch about the seat,
          did I?


EXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

                         MCCOOL
          What the... Got an unknown here.
          100 yards north-northeast.

They pile up at McCool's scope.  Jordan bulls her way
through.

SCOPE POV:  It's a women.  Dressed in civilian clothes,
she collects firewood.  And she's coming this way.

                         MCCOOL
          She part of the training?

                         JORDAN
          I don't know...

                         SLUTNIK
          "She?"  There's another one?

McCool takes a second look.

SCOPE POV:  Of the women drawing closer... closer... and
finally looking dead-bang at us.  She does an about-face
and walks away.  Quickly.

                         MCCOOL
          Shit.  Think we're had.

                         CORTEZ
          Smoke her.

                         MCCOOL
          I ain't gonna shoot her.

                         CORTEZ
          Only blanks.  Lemme do it.

                         MCCOOL
                  (pushing him away)
          Hey.  Ain't your call, man.

He looks to Jordan.

                         JORDAN
          Pri One is to protect the mission.
          If she represents a real threat, we
          have to do it.

Pleased, Cortez slips his rifle under a roof panel.

                         JORDAN
                  (to McCool)
          But did she see us?  Do you know for
          a fact that we are compromised?

McCool doesn't.  Not for sure.

                         JORDAN
          If not, firing will only give away
          our position to hostiles in the
          area.  Now how smart is that?

                         MCCOOL
                  (a beat)
          Mighta been civilian.

                         NEWBERRY
          They got regular peeps on this
          island, don't they?


EXT.  ROAD - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

The asphalt road shimmers with midday heat.  Suddenly a
TROOP CARRIER ROARS over a rise.


INT.  HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

SCOPE POV:  Of the troop carrier braking hard.  "Hostiles"
spill out the rear -- and fan out all around us.

                         CORTEZ
                  (at scope)
          Banditos on the east perimeter!  150
          yards!  Shit, she was part of it!

                         MCCOOL
          Fuck me.

                         FLEA
          What's the word, el-tee?  We're
          about one minute from a major take-
          down here.

HOLD on Jordan, heart skipping.  Did she really make the
wrong call?

                         JORDAN
          All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers.
          Drop everything but weapons and the
          PRC radio -- we're gonna be high
          speed, low drag all the way to the
          link-up site.  Ready?

                         SLUTNIK
          Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.

                         JORDAN
          MOVE!


EXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

They come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts,
splintering into three groups and laying down SUPPRESSIVE
FIRE as they blitz for...

The woodlands.

"Hostiles" FIRE and pursue.

Flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath
him.  He goes down like a doped race horse.  Suddenly
exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:  Flea ran
right over their hide-site.

Slutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet.


EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Breathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the
link-up site just inside the woods.  Flea comes in
hobbling.  Badly.

                         SLUTNIK
          This ain't workin' right!

                         MCCOOL
          What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?

                         SLUTNIK
          This ain't even workin' wrong!

A beat as Jordan deliberates.  She doesn't want to go out
like this.

                         FLEA
          Really don't wanna be captured, el-
          tee.  Heard some bad things.

                         JORDAN
          Fuck.
                  (snatching the radio)
          Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew
          Six requesting emergency extraction.
          Stand by for a PRC fix...


EXT.  SKY - DAY

As a helo pirouettes in midair.


EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Jordan's crew lopes through the woods, searching for a
place to bring the helo down.  Right on their heels...

ARTILLERY SIMULATORS THUMP-THUMP-THUMP, illumination
GRENADES POP and flare.  This may not be war, but it'll do
until the real thing comes along.


INT.  HELO - DAY

PILOT'S POV:  Buzzing treetops, searching.


EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

On the run:

                         MCCOOL
          32 feet, six inches!

                         JORDAN
          I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!

Finally they break into a clearing.  Is it big enough?

                         JORDAN
          'Cool?

                         MCCOOL
                  (doesn't care)
          Smoke it!

Jordan chucks a smoke grenade.


INT.  HELO - DAY

PILOT'S POV:  Yellow smoke rises from the woods.  We swoop
toward it.


EXT.  CLEARING IN WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Whirling smoke, the helo descends.  Jordan's crew breaks
early, trying to get there the instant it touches down.
But before they can...

An FAV crashes through the underbrush, M-60s BARKING in
the helo's direction.  The helo bounds away.

Jordan's crew tries to retreat -- but a second FAV cuts
them off.


INT.  HELO - DAY

PILOT'S POV:  Of the action below, growing smaller and
smaller:  Jordan's crew.  Surrounded.  Laying down
weapons.  Captured.


EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

JORDAN'S POV:  Brush slapping her face.

Crew Six is being hauled through the woods, hands tied
back, boots around their necks, pulled along by...

The captors.  We assume they're instructors in camouflage
paint -- but we're moving so fast it's impossible to be
sure.


EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

A P.O.W. camp, disturbingly authentic.  A dozen trainees
are already here, held in pens of bamboo and barbed-wire.

Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry -- all five get
tossed into a pen.  Jordan is pulled away.

                         FLEA
          Where are you... HEY!  Where are you
          taking her?


EXT.  BOXES - P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Jordan is thrown to the ground.  Her eyes go wide when she
sees a row of steel boxes nearby.  They're scarcely larger
then coffins.


INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY

Hands push Jordan inside the box.  She has to curl up
fetally just to fit.

                         JORDAN
          How long?
                  (no answer)
          Please, HOW LONG?

The LID BANGS closed.  A LOCK RATCHETS, FOOTSTEPS RETREAT.
Daylight sheets in through ventilation slats.

When her eyes adjust, Jordan finds markings on the lid and
walls.  Scratchings made with a nail.  The memoirs of
previous tenants.

                         JORDAN
          "Don't know how much I can take"...
          "A little taste of death"... "Save
          the nail"...
                  (then the real kick-
                   in-the-teeth)
          "It's been three days now"...


EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT

As "hostiles" pull Flea out of the pen.


INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - NIGHT

A BANGING wakes Jordan.  Are they coming for her?  But
FOOTSTEPS LEAVE.  A GROAN from the adjacent box.

                         JORDAN
          Who is it?

                         WICKWIRE (O.S.)
                  (a beat)
          You know, I had an apartment about
          this size once.

                         JORDAN
          Wick.  They got your crew, too?

                         WICKWIRE (O.S.)
          Intagliata was out chasing
          breakfast.  They found his tracks.
          Well, shit.

A beat.

                         JORDAN
          You really came back for more?  Of
          this?

                         WICKWIRE (O.S.)
          When I was sittin' behind a desk in
          Washington, it made sense, somehow.
          Blame it on my big brother.  He was
          Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used
          to tell...

                         JORDAN
          If you got a good one, Wick...

Anything to get her mind off this box.  Out of this box.
Now INTERCUT Jordan and Wickwire, lying like fraternal
twins in their wombs of steel:

                         WICKWIRE
          One time he was doing a rekkie of
          the Libyan coastline.  This is,
          like, right before we bombed
          Khadaffi into the past tense.  So
          his crew does a nighttime infil,
          maps all the big artillery
          placements and stuff, then turns
          around to get the hell gone.  But
          between them and the water are five
          Libyan guards, all armed to the
          nuts.

                         JORDAN
          They had to kill 'em?

                         WICKWIRE
          Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But
          on every guard's chest,they left one
          Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little
          calling card to say they'd been
          there -- and could come back any
          time they wanted.

                         JORDAN
          That's a good story.

                         WICKWIRE
          So the shit you gotta go through?
          To get from here to there?  Brother
          said it was worth it.  Worth the
          training... worth the divorce...
          worth anything.

                         JORDAN
          He was married?

                         WICKWIRE
          At first.

                         JORDAN
          You got anybody, Wick?

                         WICKWIRE
          Not me.  You?

It hurts to think about it.  The Potomac.  The gunkhole
harbor.  Royce.

                         WICKWIRE
          O'Neil?

                         JORDAN
          How'd you make it last time, Wick?
          How'd you get through this part?

                         WICKWIRE
                  (a beat)
          Last time I didn't.

                         JORDAN
                  (jarred)
          Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep
          talkin' to me...


EXT.  NEWSSTAND - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

Royce stops for a newspaper.  As he pays, something else
catches his eye.  He picks up...

A "People" magazine.  The grainy image of "G.I. Jane"
fills the cover.  A photo inset, much clearer, shows a
beaming DeHaven.  "BEHIND EVERY GREAT WOMAN..."

                         ROYCE
                  (shaking head)
          Suitable for framing...


INT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY

                         ROYCE
          Got time for a brain-pick?

Reading as he walks, a former CIA spook looks up to find
Royce in lockstep.  It surprises him:  Not many people
here talk to him -- unless they're in trouble.  THE SPOOK
is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be
right at home on Easter Island:  This is a man who's seen
most of the world's ills -- and forgotten none.

                         THE SPOOK
          Subject?

                         ROYCE
          O'Neil, Jordan.

                         THE SPOOK
          Thought you two were file-closed.

                         ROYCE
          You knew about us?

                         THE SPOOK
          Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.


INT.  SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY

Royce and the Spook enter.  The vault-like door closes
emphatically.  Ensuring their privacy:

                         ROYCE
          Computer -- no transcription, no
          com-link, no data-link.  In fact...
          shut-down sequence 0-Niner-0-8,
          mark.

All around, screens go blank, phone lights extinguish.
They sit at the conference table.  No Computer.  No files.

Just two guys doing headwork.

                         THE SPOOK
          All right.  So who stands to gain if
          Jordan flames out in a big way?

                         ROYCE
          The E-Ringers?  Full integration is
          gonna cost the services billions at
          the worst possible time -- when
          Congress is already swinging the
          axe.

                         THE SPOOK
                  (agreeing)
          Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But
          Pentagon's a big place.  Let's
          narrow the sights.

                         ROYCE
          The Navy?  They've made it clear
          they don't want to pull missiles out
          of subs to make room for women's
          heads.  What's it gonna cost to make
          a fleet of Trident's co-ed?   

                         THE SPOOK
          Sabotage born of economics?
          Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes
          really going to start his watch with
          such a public failure?

                         ROYCE
          Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.

                         THE SPOOK
          Hmm.  Let's aim higher.

Royce blinks.  "What's higher?"

                         THE SPOOK
          The White House.  If Jordan wins,
          DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well,
          it's been said that the only man the
          President fears -- ain't no man.

                         ROYCE
          The first female President?

                         THE SPOOK
          Don't for a second think she didn't
          leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives
          DeHaven a symbol that taps into the
          biggest constituency of them all.

                         ROYCE
          Women.

                         THE SPOOK
          If you were the President, wouldn't
          that put a little piss in your
          shoes?

                         ROYCE
          I don't know.  Seems...

                         THE SPOOK
          This ain't about some little soldier
          girl sloggin' her way through
          commando school.  The implications
          go way beyond.

                         ROYCE
          Christ, I don't want to see her take
          a fall.  She thinks I do, but...

                         THE SPOOK
          I take it this file is still open.

                         ROYCE
                  (shaping his words)
          Even tough I don't talk to her every
          day -- I still talk to her every
          day.  Know what I mean?

                         THE SPOOK
                  (nodding)
          Okay, so now work it from the other
          end.  Think about California -- and
          how things might be handled there.

                         ROYCE
          I don't...
                  (scoffing)
          What, someone on base?  A "mole"?

                         THE SPOOK
          This is what you get for brain-
          picking an old CIA spook.  but if I
          needed to control the outcome of
          this test case, that's how I'd do
          it.  A man-in-place.  Makes
          everything very controllable.


INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY

JORDAN'S POV:  The box opening.  Daylight assaulting us,
blowing out our eyes.  Disembodied hands pulling us out.


EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Legs hobbled, uniform soiled, Jordan is led past a row of
huts.  She looks like she got hit by a train -- and got
back up.

JORDAN'S POV:  Vision still blown out.  But inside the
pen, we make out 40 trainees now.  One guy wrings out a
sock and drinks from it.

Jordan moves past huts.  VOLATILE VOICES spill out as
trainees get interrogated.

JORDAN'S POV:  Outside one hut, we see Flea.  At least we
think it's him:  Strapped face-down to a table, sobbing
quietly, he wears a slinky dress and whore's makeup.  They
broke him -- and it's an ugly, ugly sight.


INT.  INTERROGATION HUT - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY

                         THE CHIEF
          What is your father's name?

Jordan seated.  Prowling the hut is her interrogator.  Her
tormentor.  Her chaperon through Hell.

                         THE CHIEF
          Simple question, lieutenant.  No
          reason not to answer.  What is your
          father's name?

                         JORDAN
          "Dad."

                         THE CHIEF
          Any brothers?  Sisters?

                         JORDAN
          Dick, Jane, and Spot.

                         THE CHIEF
          Are you hungry?  What's your
          favorite food?  We'll try to get it
          for you.

                         JORDAN
          Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not
          going to get anywhere.  You might as
          well put me in the cage.

                         THE CHIEF
          You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right
          here, right now.

                         JORDAN
          Should I be afraid?

                         THE CHIEF
          Right down to your worthless womb,
          and I'll tell you why.  This is my
          island.  My world.  And here I can
          get away with shit that would get me
          arrested anywhere else in the world.
          Take another scan of my little joy-
          boy outside.  If I can do that to a
          Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to
          you?  Huh?

It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid.
Continuing the psychological strip-search:

                         THE CHIEF
          Why didn't you shoot the woman,
          O'Neil?

                         JORDAN
          Wasn't deemed a threat.

                         THE CHIEF
          She led us right to you.  That's no
          threat?

Jordan rubs her head.  So long ago.  How did the call come
down?

                         THE CHIEF
          Would you have shot if it was a man?

                         JORDAN
          No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --

                         THE CHIEF
          The others already told me, O'Neil.
          They wanted to shoot, but you
          wouldn't let them.  Because you went
          soft on another women --

                         JORDAN
          That's not right.

                         THE CHIEF
          That's what your crew said.  Are
          they lying?  Or are you?

                         JORDAN
          I think you're the liar.

                         THE CHIEF
          I'm not the one who got five good
          men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You
          wear the bars, you made the call,
          and you got your whole crew --

                         JORDAN
          We didn't know we were compromised.
          Firing would only've given away our
          position.

                         THE CHIEF
          You think we should go easy on
          women, O'Neil?

She stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question.

                         THE CHIEF
          Do you?

                         JORDAN
          No.

                         THE CHIEF
          I'm so glad we agree.

With stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes
her out the door...


EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

... and throws her onto a table.

In the pens, all faces turn to watch.  Even instructors
stop what they're doing as...

The Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind
her.

                         THE CHIEF
          Didn't you know you'd be raped if
          you were captured?  Didn't you even
          think about that?

                         JORDAN
          Sure.  Just like your men do.

                         THE CHIEF
          I think we oughtta practice it,
          just so you know what to expect.

He flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open
her pants.

                         JORDAN
          Should I practice bleeding, too,
          sir?  Would that make me a better
          soldier?

He covers her mouth -- her whole face -- with one hand.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (to the men)
          Any of you can stop this!  Just give
          me the location of one more hide-
          site, and it ends right here!

In the pen:

                         SLUTNIK
                  (wide-eyed)
          Someone's trippin' out here...

The Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead
dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give
the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty
face.

                         THE CHIEF
          Three crews are still on this island
          somewhere.  Who knows where?

The men trade itchy looks.  Some do know.

                         JORDAN
          Don't do it, don't do it...

The Chief throws her down like garbage.

                         THE CHIEF
          Who's gonna tell me?  Who's gonna be
          chivalrous and stop this abuse?
          What, you want to see her get
          mauled?  Is that it?

The men shift anxiously.  Should they talk?  Behind the
Chief, Jordan staggers to her feet.

                         JORDAN
          Don't tell him shi --

The Chief whirls, decks her a crescent-kick.  Instructors
lurch forward instinctively.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (waving them back)
          She's fine!
                  (squatting beside)
          When I put you down, O'Neil, take
          the hint and stay down.

She licks her bloody teeth -- and considers kicking his
balls into his brainpan.  Instead she makes a move to get
up.  He grinds her back down with a crowbar forearm.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (for her ears only)
          I am saving your life, O'Neil.  You
          may not know it, but I do.  You're
          an inferior soldier, a bad officer,
          and I don't want you learning that
          inconvenient truth when you're stuck
          in a muddy bomb crater behind enemy
          lines and don't know how the fuck to
          get out.  You get out now, O'Neil.
          Seek life elsewhere.  And if you
          can't do it in front of me, do it
          behind my back.

Pinning her down with just his eyes, he rises -- and
starts away.

Behind him, Jordan struggles to rise.

An ANXIOUS MURMUR races through the men:  They don't want
to see this.  They don't want to see her crucified.

                         MCCOOL
          Down... stay down...

Hearing, the Chief turns back to see...

Jordan wobbling to her feet.

Eye-lock.

                         JORDAN
          Fuck you and the boat you rode in
          on.  Sir.

TIGHT on the faces of her crewmates -- Slutnik, Cortez,
McCool.  In their eyes, a new respect.  The Chief see it.
Instructors see it.  Everyone does.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (to instructors)
          We're done here.

Beaten, he walks right out of camp.

Wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes.
Wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight.  But this time
he made it.

A medic tries to help Jordan, but she pushes him away,
walking drunkenly for...

Flea.  She begins wiping the makeup from his face.

                         JORDAN
          Make you a deal, Flea.  Never tell
          me how I look -- and I'll never tell
          you.


EXT.  PIERS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - SUNSET

The Chief chucks gear onto a transport boat.  FOOTSTEPS
approach.  He knows it's Pyro.

                         THE CHIEF
          You don't think she'd be raped if
          she were captured?  You don't think
          the threat of rape would be used to
          leverage the men?

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          You broke a dozen training rules
          back there -- before I lost count.

                         THE CHIEF
          I've had it.  Just because they pay
          me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean
          I'm gonna be one.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          She's a trainee, just like the
          others.  Why are you coming down so
          hard?

                         THE CHIEF
          She's an officer.  There's a higher
          standard.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          She's a women, and that's why you're
          ridin' her bareback.

                         THE CHIEF
          Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay
          on her until everyone realizes this
          is not some bullshit equal-rights
          thing, that real lives are gonna be
          lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          I oughtta report you.

                         THE CHIEF
          I think you probably would -- if you
          didn't know I was right.


EXT.  STREET - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

As a limo moves -- heads for the Capitol building.


INT.  DEHAVEN'S LIMO - DAY

DeHaven snags a BUZZING PHONE.

                         DEHAVEN
          Yes?

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
                  (anxious)
          Did you hear?

                         DEHAVEN
          She made it through S.E.R.E.
          training.  Got a call this morning
          from --

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
          Not that.  The White House just
          announced that it was sponsoring
          legislation that would, in one
          stroke, void all remaining elements
          of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.

The phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the
seat beside her.  HOLD on her disbelieving face.

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
          You there?  Senator?


INT.  CORRIDOR - PENTAGON - DAY

Hand-carrying a report, Flag Officer #1 hurries down a
corridor, pushes through a door.  HOLD on the door marker:
"Secretary of the Navy."


INT.  SECNAV OFFICE - PENTAGON - DAY

                         HAYES
          Without telling us they do this?
          With absolutely no lead time?

At his desk, Hayes scans the report with a deepening
frown.

                         FLAG OFFICER #1
                  (to Hayes)
          Mr. Secretary, if this bill
          passes...

                         FLAG OFFICER #2
          Forget our three-year plan.  They're
          rushing the cadence.  We'll be
          forced to reorganize the Navy from
          top to bottom -- overnight.

                         HAYES
          What the hell is the President
          trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's
          thunder?

                         FLAG OFFICER #1
          I think it's more important, sir, to
          decide what we're going to do --
          since it's apparent this issue is
          not going away quietly.

                         HAYES
          "G.I. Jane."  And which one of you
          told me she wouldn't last a week?
          Huh?

The flags squirm.  Shaking his head, Hayes moves to a
window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National
Cemetery.

                         HAYES
          20 years in the Pentagon, I finally
          rate an office with a window -- and
          it looks out over the world's
          largest graveyard.  Think it's a
          sign?


EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

The bell.  It reflects the moon.  TILT DOWN to reveal a
new batch of helmets -- the casualties of S.E.R.E.  A
graveyard of its own.


EXT.  THE EXCHANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan exits with purchases.  Her face is still bruised
from S.E.R.E.  With a minute to kill, she peruses a
bulletin board casually.  But a RAISED VOICE leads her
eyes to...

Wickwire.  At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.  He
looks flustered when he spots Jordan.

                         JORDAN
          Sorry, didn't mean to --

                         WICKWIRE
          That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend.
          And know I remember why.

                         JORDAN
          First big night of liberty and no
          date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.

                         WICKWIRE
          Maybe I'll just head over to McP's
          with the others, have a drink or
          four.  Don't wanna come, do you?

                         JORDAN
                  (touching bruises)
          I can't go out.  Not like this.

                         WICKWIRE
          I think you look beautiful.

                         JORDAN
          Thanks for lying.  But you're the
          class officer, Wick, and it'd just
          be weird if we hook up.  Besides...

Catching up, Blondell exits the exchange.

                         BLONDELL
          Sorry.  Forgot I needed oregano
          and...

She sees Wickwire.  An awkward beat for them all.

                         JORDAN
          Do you, uh, know...

                         WICKWIRE
          Sure, sure.

                         JORDAN
          We're going over to her place to
          make salad and pasta.  Just, you
          know, nothing special.

                         WICKWIRE
          Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.

Jordan and Blondell head for the parking lot.  HOLD on
Wickwire, looking after them.  Thinking it through.


INT.  CLASSROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Charts are being passed around the room.  Every trainee
takes one, including Jordan.

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          ... underwater detonation devices
          employ mechanical timers, and as
          such, they are subject to variances
          due to water temperature.  That's
          why when clearing mines, we always
          use two timers.  The charts now
          being passed out contain
          calculations you must memorize
          before...

A MILITARY COP fills the classroom doorway.  Frowning,
Johns joins the cop for a private discussion.

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          O'Neil?

                         JORDAN
          Sir?

                         INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
          You're wanted at the C.O.'s.


INT.  C.O.'S OUTER OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan enters.  The yeoman's desk is unattended.  Noticing
the X.O.'s door open, Jordan peers inside to find...

Blondell.  She looks scared out of her mind.  Before she
and Jordan can speak, the yeoman materializes.

                         YEOMAN
          This way, lieutenant.  They're
          expecting you.


INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

                         JORDAN
          See me, sir?

The C.O. and X.O. are both here.

                         C.O.
                  (uncomfortable)
          I don't know of any delicate way to
          say this, lieutenant, so I won't
          try.  Claims have been made that you
          have engaged in fraternization -- of
          the same-sex variety.  Specifically,
          that you were...
                  (reading)
          "... seen leaving the apartment of
          another female officer at such a
          time and in such a manner as to
          suggest conduct unbecoming."

                         JORDAN
                  (a beat,laughing in
                   relief)
          Sir, if someone is suggesting that
          I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.

The C.O.'s face remains grim.  He isn't relieved.

                         JORDAN
          They're very wrong.  And I'd like to
          know where you got this information.

On the C.O.'s nod, the X.O. opens an adjoining office.
Wickwire enters.  He's stiff as a groom on a wedding cake.

                         WICKWIRE
          I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class
          officer, it's my obligation to
          report all violations.

                         JORDAN
          This is insane.  You've got no
          proof.

                         X.O.
                  (from report)
          You were seen leaving Ensign
          Blondell's apartment at
          approximately 0-200, whereupon
          physical affections were exchanged
          in public.

                         JORDAN
          We hugged.

                         X.O.
          In addition, you have been seen
          frequenting the base exchange, the
          mess hall, the --

                         JORDAN
          Because the men didn't want me
          eating with them.  Jesus Christ,
          let's get this right.

                         C.O.
          That's enough.  Everybody.
                  (to Wickwire)
          Rejoin your class, lieutenant.

                         WICKWIRE
                  (only to Jordan)
          I wish I didn't have to do this,
          Jordan.

                         C.O.
          Dismissed, lieutenant.

Wickwire exits.

                         JORDAN
          Sir, I just want you to know that
          this is either a gross mistake --
          or someone's vindictive bullshit.
          In no way did anything happen
          between Ensign Blondell and myself.
          We're just friends.

                         X.O.
          So you're saying the charges have no
          validity whatsoever?

Jordan opens her mouth to confirm -- and hesitates,
realizing where this might be headed.  What the collateral
damage might be.

                         JORDAN
          I'm saying, we're just friends.

                         C.O.
          I find this as distasteful as you,
          lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk,
          it's on my shoulders.  There's going
          to be an inquiry -- it will not be
          quick and it will definitely not be
          pretty.  You should prepare
          yourself.

                         JORDAN
          Sir, please... if there's any way to
          do this without dragging everyone
          through the mud...

                         C.O.
          I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.

Jordan moves to the door.  Again she makes eye-contact
with Blondell.  Now we understand why she's so scared:
There's a witch-hunt brewing.

                         JORDAN
                  (turning back)
          Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under
          your command... would the inquiry
          still go forward?

                         C.O.
          I'm not sure what --

                         JORDAN
          Would you have the discretion to end
          it right then and there?

She's offering her own head on a silver platter -- and the
C.O. actually hesitates before answering.

                         C.O.
          I believe so.


EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

McCool and Flea exit a classroom with other trainees.
They spot Jordan approaching.

                         MCCOOL
          So what'd he want?  O'Neil?

She passes them robotically.  Flea realizes where she's
going.

                         FLEA
          Oh, no... no, no, no, no...

They lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way.

                         THE CHIEF
          Stand fast!

McCool and Flea jerk to a stop:  The Chief has emerged
from the instructor's office.  Helpless, they watch as...

Jordan mounts the stairs to the bell... takes up the
baton... and HITS THE BELL like a tyko drummer.

RING ONE:  On the pained faces of her crewmates.

RING TWO:  On the Chief.  Taking no joy in it.  Just
accepting it as inevitable.


EXT.  THE QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

RING THREE:  On Wickwire as he walks across the base.  His
regrets are obvious.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT.  UPRIVER - THE POTOMAC - DAY

The ice floes are gone.  The river banks are budding
green.  Soon CAMERA FINDS a power boat making its way
upriver.  A lone figure sits on the prow.


EXT.  POWER BOAT - DAY

It's Jordan.  Dressed in civvies, gunnysack between her
legs, she's back in Virginia with nothing more than what
she left with.  Around a river bend appears...

The gunkhole harbor.  Home.


EXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - DAY

The boat docks.  Jordan springs clear, waves a worn-out
thanks, starts up the dock.  But now she comes to a stop,
seeing...

Royce.  Stepping out of the house.

EXTREMELY WIDE:  River shimmering behind them, they meet
on the dock.  A charged stand-off:  Where do they pick up?
Can they pick up?  Then Jordan drops her gunnysack and
steps into his wide-spread arms.  Royce wraps her up as if
to never let go.

For the first time in this whole ordeal, Jordan begins
crying, sobbing uncontrollably.

                         ROYCE
                  (in her ear)
          I want to kill them... I want to
          kill the guys who made you cry like
          this...


INT.  COVERED PORCH - JORDAN'S HOUSE - SUNSET

An hour later.  Sharing a quiet moment, Jordan and Royce
cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that
overlooks the Potomac and a fiery sunset.

                         JORDAN
          All I wanted was an honest chance.
          And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't
          stay.

                         ROYCE
          And this class officer...
          "Wickwire."  You think he was just
          trying to get even?  Striking back
          for...

                         JORDAN
          Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like
          he was getting any satisfaction out
          of it.  Almost like...
                  (a beat)
          Did I say he was class officer?

                         ROYCE
          Almost like someone put him up to
          it.  Okay, who?

                         JORDAN
          No shortage of suspects.

                         ROYCE
          The Chief?  Or maybe even
          Turrentine?  Your C.O.?

She looks at him sidelong.

                         JORDAN
          Royce.  Tell me you didn't keep a
          file on me.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase.
One contains clippings -- "G.I. Jane" photos, editorials,
political cartoons.  Another holds records of Coronado
personnel -- Jordan's crewmates, instructors, the base
brass.

                         ROYCE
          Somebody was yankin' your stings,
          Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles
          away.  I wanted to know who.  I still
          do.

She shakes her head, resisting.

                         ROYCE
          C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with
          me.

                         JORDAN
          It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.

                         ROYCE
          Someone screwed you over like this,
          left unanswered charges hanging over
          your head, and you're not gonna
          fight back?

                         JORDAN
          I'm tired of fighting back.  I just
          wanted to come home and be safe and
          have you here and the river there
          and just forget the rest of the
          world, okay?

                         ROYCE
          Well, before you crawl off to die,
          Jordan, give me five minutes of good
          headwork.

Agitated, she walks away.  B.G., a PHONE RINGS until the
machine picks up.

                         ROYCE
                  (pulling a file)
          "John James Urgayle."  The Chief.

                         JORDAN
          What about him.

                         JORDAN
          Instructors typically pull three
          year assignments.  This guy's in and
          out in one year -- your year.  That
          sound right?

                         JORDAN
          Sounds like an amazing coincidence.

                         ROYCE
          Or like maybe he was baby sitting a
          problem child for the Navy.

                         JORDAN
          I don't know, I don't care.

                         ROYCE
          Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who
          else?  Who could've leveraged a
          class officer like that?  C'mon,
          Jordan, keep your head in the game.

UNDER DIALOG, we hear some of the INCOMING CALL:

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.)
          ... just got word today.  The
          Senator wants you to know that she's
          disturbed by the matter, and she'll
          be looking into it carefully to make
          sure you were treated fairly.  If
          you need to reach us, we're here in
          Washington, 202-224-3121.

A HANG-UP.  Something stirs in Jordan's memory.

                         JORDAN
          "In Washington..."

                         ROYCE
          What?

                         JORDAN
          Wickwire said he was dry-docked in
          Washington between stints at
          Coronado...

We can see her mind gathering speed.  Royce switches files
quickly.

                         ROYCE
          "Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second
          run at Coronado... and correct, they
          had him stashed in the
          "Appropriation Liaison Office,"
          whatever that is.

                         JORDAN
          You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and
          get another shot without
          dispensation from someone up in flag
          country.
                  (a revelation)
          He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.

                         ROYCE
          I'd sure like to know who.

                         JORDAN
          Yeah.  Me too.

                         BLONDELL
          Who's...

          Lieuten --

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
          Or rank.  But can you do me a favor
          and pull a transfer order?

                         BLONDELL
          Okay, but... You didn't have to do
          what you did.  Not for me.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
                  (appreciative)
          "Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what
          you can find.

File in hand, Blondell returns to the phone.

                         BLONDELL
          Got it.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
          Who signed as his "sponsoring
          officer"?

                         BLONDELL
          Uh... don't see it.  There's no
          signature.  But hang on -- there's a
          note to "See Addendum."  Checking...

She finds a crisp sheet of stationary, out of place among
the smeared government forms.

                         BLONDELL
          Wow...

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
          What'd you find, Kathy?

CLOSE on the stationary.  It bears an image of the Capitol
dome.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:

EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

The real Capitol dome.  A flag is being raised over the
Senate Wing.


EXT.  CAPITOL BDLG.  - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

A car parks at barricades.  Jordan and Royce emerge, both
in uniforms.

                         D.C. COP
          Don't even dream about leaving that
          vehicle there.

                         ROYCE
          Government car -- tow it if you
          want.  Just point us to DeHaven's
          office first.

Not waiting for directions, Jordan takes the Capitol steps
two at a time.  We've seen this look on her face before --
and last time, she nearly knocked the grinder bell into
orbit.


INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Jordan and Royce move quickly down a corridor, eyes
hunting, passing CAPITOL GUIDES and their tourists.  Soon
they find...

DeHaven's office.  A Navy captain exits with paperwork.
Hasty salutes.

                         ROYCE
          Capt'n.

                         NAVY CAPTAIN
          Commander.

The captain moves on.  Royce holds in the doorway a beat,
memory nagging him.  Again he looks at...

The captain.  He has a distinct bald spot.

                         ROYCE
                  (to Jordan)
          Get started here.  I'll catch up.

Picking up where he left off a few weeks ago, Royce
follows Bald Spot around a corner...


INT.  PRIVATE STAIRCASE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

... down a private staircase...


INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

... and through a door marked "Naval Appropriation Liaison
Office."  It's not 30 seconds from DeHaven's door.


INT.  FOYER - DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

                         SECRETARY
          Your name again?

                         JORDAN
          Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil.

In a side office, DeHaven's aide overhears.  He rises
quickly and enters the foyer.

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE
          Ms. O'Neil.  Yes, of course.  I'm
          Douglas Champeau.  Unfortunately,
          the Senator is in chamber right now.
          How can I help you?

                         JORDAN
          What chamber?  Which way is that?

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE
          I mean, she's on the floor of the
          Senate.

                         JORDAN
          Okay, which way?

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE
          She really can't be disturbed.  But
          if you care to wait, I'll find you
          an office with a phone.  It might be
          several hours, but --

A TOURIST pokes in.

                         TOURIST
          'Scuse me, but I'm here to pick up
          gallery tickets?  Are you...

                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE
          See the secretary, please.

Over the aide's shoulder, Jordan watches as...

The tourist claims tickets.  HOLD on the bureau near the
secretary's desk where the tickets are stored.


INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

On the chamber floor, SENATORS mull about, consulting
aides, polling party mates.  PAGES place microphones and
fill the ceremonial snuff boxes, readying the room for
session.  Among the activity, we find...

DeHaven.  Caucusing with another Democrat.

                         JORDAN (O.S.)
          Senator DeHaven...

DeHaven looks behind her.  Nobody.

                         JORDAN
          DeHaven...

Now she looks up to behold...

Jordan standing in the gallery.  Staring down on DeHaven
as she is, it's hard to read anything into her expression
but open disdain.

Drawn by Jordan's voice, a CAPITOL GUARD hurries down the
gallery steps.  Royce runs interference.

                         JORDAN
          We can talk here or we can talk
          outside, Senator.  You tell me.

On the floor, half the U.S. Senate stops what it's doing
and looks up.

In the gallery, the guard is thrown off-balance by the
naval uniforms:  Do Royce and Jordan belong here or not?
Confused, he looks for guidance from...

DeHaven.  She notes C-SPAN cameras swinging Jordan's way.
Summoning a page:

                         DEHAVEN
          Cloak room.  I'll meet her there.
          Just her.


INT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Towering doors swing open.  DeHaven appears, face pleasant
but harried.

                         DEHAVEN
          Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get
          together -- though just now I'm
          gearing up for a child-care vote
          that --

                         JORDAN
          Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.

About to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly.

                         JORDAN
          You know him.

                         DEHAVEN
          Sounds familiar.

                         JORDAN
          It should.  You nominated him for
          Spec-Recon just three days after you
          nominated me.

                         DEHAVEN
          Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch
          tomorrow?  I do very much want to
          talk, but now is scarcely --

                         JORDAN
          Did you set me up?  Did you set me
          up just to see me fail?

                         DEHAVEN
          Absolutely not.

DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber --
the open doors.  Walking Jordan a few steps away:

                         DEHAVEN
          Wickwire was there to help.  To be
          my eyes on the inside, to make sure
          you were getting a fair shot.  At
          least that was the intent.

                         JORDAN
          What changed?

                         DEHAVEN
          Should probably ask him that.

                         JORDAN
          If I have to ask again, Senator,
          I'll be asking in front of cameras.

It's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate.  The Senate
DOORKEEPER appears.

                         DOORKEEPER
          Madam Senator?  Your esteemed
          colleagues are requesting --

                         DEHAVEN
          Two seconds, Walter.
                  (answering Jordan)
          In 1981, the Supreme Court was
          asked to rule on the issue of women
          in combat positions.  The Court
          cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
          as a legal foundation for keeping
          women ineligible.  That decision
          held for all these years -- until
          the White House, 10 days ago, moved
          to have the Exclusion Laws voided.
          To demolish that legal foundation.

                         JORDAN
          So?  Isn't the President jumping on
          your bandwagon?

                         DEHAVEN
          What he did was light the bandwagon
          on fire.  Because he knows what I
          know -- that American families are
          not prepared to put their daughters
          in harm's way.

                         JORDAN
          You don't know that.

                         DEHAVEN
          In face, I do:  Roper, Harris,
          Gallop -- they all come back the
          same.

                         JORDAN
          What are you saying?  That a women's
          life is more valuable than a man's?
          That a women's death hurts a family
          more?

                         DEHAVEN
          I'm saying it's not going to happen.
          Not when the President is set to
          turn this into a third-rail issue
          should I choose to ever campaign
          against him.  He will fry me six
          ways to Sunday for sending daughters
          and young mothers off to war -- and,
          quite possibly, for bringing them
          back in body bags.

Jordan shakes her head in disbelief.  She has met the
enemy -- and she is us.

                         JORDAN
          You were never going to let women
          serve in combat.  You always had a
          safety net.  Or thought you did.

                         DEHAVEN
          Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully
          understand this -- but sometimes
          there's more to be gained from the
          fight than the victory.

                         JORDAN
          So the rhetoric gets you headlines.
          But the reality gets you in trouble.

                         DEHAVEN
          The reality is this:  We send far
          too many men off to war.  I don't
          need to compound the problem with
          women.
                  (off Jordan's look)
          Can you honestly tell me you wanted
          that life?  Squat-pissing in some
          third-world jungle with --

                         JORDAN
          I wanted the choice.  The chance to
          prove myself, my skills, my work,
          me.  That's how it should've been.

                         DOORKEEPER
          Madam Senator, once again I must --

                         DEHAVEN
          Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter.

Not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove,
grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions.
He enters the chamber...


INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

... and moves behind the rostrum.  Holding the broom by
the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes...

And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by
three minutes.

Senators GROAN.  It's an old trick played by senior
members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them.


INT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

                         DEHAVEN
          I once promised you a fast ticket,
          Jordan, and I always meant to make
          good on that.  Come work for me.  I
          can always use a hard-charger on my
          team.

                         JORDAN
          You promise Wickwire a fast ticket,
          too?

                         DEHAVEN
          I've had no direct communication
          with him since this whole thing
          began.  And that's quite verifiable.

                         JORDAN
          I'm sure it is.

                         DEHAVEN
          You'll think about my offer?

                         JORDAN
          You know, I wonder what the SecNav
          would think about it.  If I spoke
          with him.

                         DEHAVEN
          Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this
          morning myself -- and told him the
          deal was off.  No more test cases.
          He was only too happy to oblige.
                  (dangerously low)
          Don't play politics with me, little
          darlin'.  You'd be up way past your
          bedtime.

                         DOORKEEPER
                  (distraught)
          Madam Senator, please...

                         DEHAVEN
          I'll call you in a few days.

She flashes a winning smile and turns away.  As the
chamber doors start to close behind her:

                         JORDAN
          So I wonder what the President would
          think.

The last image we have of DeHaven is her whirling back,
startled.  The DOORS BOOM CLOSED in her face.


EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Through a window, we see the C.O. with a phone pressed to
his ear.  He stands at attention even though wearing a
bathrobe.  Half-audible through the glass:

                         C.O.
          Yes sir.  No, I'm not saying it
          would be impossible, sir, just...
          Yes sir.  No sir.  Yes sir.  I can
          appreciate that, sir.  Good night,
          sir.


INT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

The C.O. hangs up and looks to Jordan, heretofore unseen.
She waits anxiously.

                         C.O.
          Well, if you had to go over my
          head, lieutenant, that's the way to
          do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200
          call from the Commander and Chief to
          get the bowels movin'.

                         JORDAN
          Sir?  What did he say?

                         C.O.
          Basically -- he asked me if I could
          unring a bell.


EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

START on the helmet graveyard.  Hands enter FRAME to
reclaim one helmet in particular.  TILT UP on Jordan,
back in the grinder, back in Navy greens.

The Spec-Recon class is here.  Crewmates gawk like stone
idiots as Jordan takes her old place in the line-up.

                         C.O.
                  (to class)
          One of you here understands better
          than anyone what this is all about.
          Someone who has engaged in conduct
          unbecoming.  Someone who knows, I
          would hope, what he must now do.

CLOSE on Wickwire.  Feeling the heat.  Wondering if they
really know who it is.  Now the C.O. parks himself right
in Wickwire's face.

                         C.O.
          And unless that someone takes the
          honorable way out in the next 10
          seconds -- I will make certain he
          faces action under the Uniform Code
          of Military Justice.

Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell.  He slows
when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows
would be inadequate.

                         JORDAN
          Just walk away and never stop.

He does.  As Wickwire RINGS OUT:

                         C.O.
          It seems we have an opening for
          class officer.  Any nominations?

Eyes swing to Jordan.  Way ahead of them:

                         C.O.
          All those in favor?

A CHORUS OF AYES.  Jordan puddles up.

                         C.O.
          Chief Urgayle, turning it back over
          to you.

On his way to the front, the Chief stops to check in with
Jordan.

                         THE CHIEF
          Well, I'm trying to figure out if
          you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous
          -- or some new alloy of all three.

                         JORDAN
          Good to see you again, too, sir.

                         THE CHIEF
          Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed
          all the others.  Now try me.


EXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - DAY

The morning sun is an orange ball balanced on the Coronado
Bridge.  In silhouette, pelicans circle, some dive-bombing
into the bay below.  Suddenly a HELO HOWLS across the sun,
scattering the birds as it heads off-shore.


INT.  HELO - DAY

                         THE CHIEF
                  (setting watch)
          Four... three... two... one... hack!

Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry, Jordan.  Inside
the airborne helo, they synchronize their dive watches.

                         THE CHIEF
          Final assignment!  Each crew will be
          dropped 12 miles out!  Between you
          and the shore is a network of mines
          and underwater obstacles!  You will
          clear the obstacles, you will tag
          the mines with your crew number!
          You have until 18-hundred to make
          landfall!


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

As the helo swoops down onto the ocean deck.


INT.  HELO - DAY

The trainees double-check wet gear and survival vests.  On
Jordan's nod, they push an inflatable life boat ("ILB") to
the helo door.  It's rolled up into a rubber log.

                         THE CHIEF
          Remember!  The one thing you can
          count on in any mission is that
          anything mechanical will fail!  If
          you get stuck out here, do not call
          me, for you will no longer be in my
          class!  Try the Coast Guard!

The HELO PILOT slows to five knots.  The Chief gives
Jordan the go-ahead nod.

                         JORDAN
                  (to her crew)
          One-second intervals!  Go!


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The ILB splashes down into the ocean.  Jordan's crew helo-
casts in after it.

From the door of the circling helo, the Chief watches
as...

Jordan's crew swims to the ILB, bobbing in the swells.
Flea turns a handle on the CO2 tank meant to inflate the
boat.  Nothing happens.

                         FLEA
          C'mon, c'mon...

Cortez tries to help.  The handle spins in his grip.

                         CORTEZ
          This tank's not gonna cut it, el-
          tee.  Handle's stripped.

Jordan looks skyward.  100 feet overhead, the Chief gives
her a parting salute as the helo lifts away.

                         SLUTNIK
          I just wonder how that happened.

                         JORDAN
          Cortez, see if you can dig out the
          tools without losing the rest of out
          gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.


INT.  HELO - DAY

The helo turns into the morning sun.  PILOT and CO-PILOT
drop visors.

PILOT'S POV:  Of dots in the sun.  What the hell are try?

SMACK!  Something hits the windscreen, splattering red and
brown.

                         THE CHIEF
          What happening?!

                         PILOT
          Fucking pelicans!  Hang on!

He starts to bank clear -- but not fast enough.


EXT.  HELO - DAY

More birds pepper-shot the helo:  One SHREDS through the
main rotor, another through the tail rotor.  Another bird
gets sucked right into...

The main turbine.


INT.  HELO - DAY

A SHARP BANG... a WICKED SHIMMY... and now they whole helo
loses power.

                         PILOT
          Holy... LET'S GYRATE!

As the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for
auto-gyration.  But the bank they started is working
against them:  The helo is coming down badly, circling
like a huge steel feather.

Braced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees
ocean rushing up at him.  Fast.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

                         MCCOOL
          What the shit is...

Jordan whirls.  She's just in time to witness...

The helo hitting the water.  In seconds it's gone.

A stunned beat.  We never knew the ocean could be this
quiet.  When the anesthetic of shock wears off:

                         SLUTNIK
          You don't suppose this is just part
          of...

                         JORDAN
          FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT!
          Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the
          hell you waiting for?

Cortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the ILB,
inflating it.  The crew scrambles aboard.  Jordan digs
like a dog to find a radio.

                         JORDAN
          Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  We
          have a downed helo 12 miles west-
          south west of base with three
          aboard.  Repeat, we have a downed
          helo with three aboard...

Slutnik yanks a starter cord:  Their outboard MOTOR ROARS
to life.  The boat does a donut in the water and blasts
away.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The ILB powers over swells.  Flea is perched on the bow,
nose to the wind like a hunting dog.

                         FLEA
          CUT IT!  CUT IT HERE!

Slutnik motors down.

                         FLEA
          Close as I can get, el-tee!

                         JORDAN
          Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take
          your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!

They grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins.
Jordan snaps up the radio.

                         JORDAN
          Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  What
          is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo?
          Over.

                         BASE (V.O.)
          Crew Leader, we have a Medevac
          rerouting from Long Beach, but no
          other helos prepped at this time.
          Seafox One and Two are launching
          now.  Over.

A beat.

                         JORDAN
          Base, don't think you copied me.  We
          are 12 miles out.  Seafox tops out
          at 30 knots, which makes it a no-
          show for 18 minutes.  Over.

                         BASE (V.O.)
          You copied right, Crew Leader.
          We're looking for options ourselves.

                         SLUTNIK
          Maybe we should call the Coast
          Guard.

                         JORDAN
          Shut your hole, Slutnik.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

McCool surfaces.

                         MCCOOL
          Visibility drops dead at 40 feet.
          If they're deeper than that...

The others surface and swim in.

                         CORTEZ
          Nobody's comin' outta that crash,
          el-tee.  Nobody.

A grim beat -- and then A CRACKLE on the radio.  With a
voice seemingly from the far side of the moon:

                         THE CHIEF (V.O.)
          Base, this is Basher One.  I've got
          a small problem here.  Do you copy?

Jaws drop.

                         JORDAN
                  (into radio)
          Basher One, this is O'Neil.  We are
          barely reading you.  What is your
          situation?


EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf.


INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment,
we find the Chief, operating out of an air-pocket near the
windscreen.  The pilot is dead, impaled on his cyclic
stick, head submerged.  The co-pilot is still alive,
barely.  The Chief struggles to keep the man's head up as
he keys a survival radio.

                         THE CHIEF
          Got one other heartbeat here, looks
          touch and go.  I've got a
          questionable leg.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

                         THE CHIEF (V.O.)
          Managed to activate the ELB.  If you
          just radio base and let them know,
          they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make
          sure they send a helo with a winch
          -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.

                         JORDAN
          Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be
          here for 15 minutes.  What's your
          air situation?  Over.

                         THE CHIEF (V.O.)
          Say again?  How many micks?

                         JORDAN
          15, sir.


INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

The Chief sizes up his air pocket.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (into radio)
          That... may not be adequate.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

                         FLEA
          If we could just fix on him...

                         MCCOOL
          Beacon's a no-go for us.

                         JORDAN
                  (into radio)
          Chief -- did I see a flare box
          aboard?  And can you get at it?
          Over.


EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

The Chief props up the co-pilot's head.  Gulps air.  Ducks
underwater to grope through wreckage.  Only now do we see
that "questionable leg" he was talking about:  It's
snapped at mid-calf, blood rivering out.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

                         THE CHIEF (V.O.)
          Got it.

                         JORDAN
                  (into radio)
          Show us where you are, Chief.


EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Again the Chief goes below water.  He finds a small breach
in the fuselage... sticks the flare launcher through...
and pulls the trigger.

With a MAGNESIUM FLASH, the flare launches...


EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

... streaks toward the surface...


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

... and arcs into daylight 50 yards behind the ILB.

                         FLEA
          Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!

                         JORDAN
          Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to
          slip you some air, so we're coming
          down with a tank -- just something
          until the A-team shows.  Over.

An ominous beat.

                         JORDAN
          Chief?

                         CHIEF (V.O.)
          O'Neil... there's no air in your
          main tanks.

                         MCCOOL
          What?

They scramble to check their main dive tanks.  Even
through the gauges show full, they're dead empty.  All of
them.


INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

                         THE CHIEF
                  (into radio)
          This mission wasn't about tagging
          mines.  It was to see how you coped
          with mechanical failures.  Pretty
          fuckin' ironic, huh?

He laughs.  It's the bleakest laugh imaginable.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

                         SLUTNIK
          He's circlin' the drain, el-tee.

Jordan surveys the equipment they do have aboard -- the
stuff she can count on.  Mental turbos kicking in:

                         JORDAN
          So we got two full mini-tanks, three
          minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air
          in yours?

                         MCCOOL
          Maybe half.  Not even.

                         JORDAN
          Grab an oar, find a way to weight it
          down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez,
          help him.  Flea?  You take one of the
          two full minis -- and just follow my
          lead.

                         CORTEZ
          What, we're gonna pry 'em out with
          paddles?

                         MCCOOL
                  (grabbing her)
          O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as
          soon as we get down there.  You know
          that, don't you?

                         JORDAN
          So I guess we get one shot at it.


INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Swimming in his own blood, the Chief starts to fade away,
losing consciousness.  But then, through the cockpit
windscreen...

A hazy orb of light above him.  The orb grows and grows
until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be
savior.  Jordan.

                         THE CHIEF
          Why'd it have to be her...


EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Reaching the downed Helo, McCool and Cortez wedge their
oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until...

An opening appears.

Jordan and Flea swim into the breach...


INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

... and surface inside the wreckage.

                         JORDAN
          Chief, sir... still with me?

                         CHIEF
                  (unbuckling co-pilot)
          Take him first.  Once he's clear,
          come back with --

                         JORDAN
          Sir, let me suggest you stop giving
          orders and start doing exactly what
          I say, because that's the only way
          we're all getting out of here.  Now
          how's your vest check out?  Still
          good?


EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

McCool's air craps out.  He abandons his oar and swims for
the surface.  That leaves only...

Cortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open.
He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it
scares the bejeezus out of him.


INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

                         JORDAN
          Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed
          him air.  Chief, sir, you and I are
          gonna take the express elevator
          outta here.  Remember to let your
          air out.  Ready?


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Twin transports -- Seafox One and Two -- pound across the
water.  Instructors sweep binoculars, trying to spot...

The ILB.  Newberry POPS A FLARE skyward as Slutnik
DOWNLOADS INFO over the radio.


EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Cortez's air goes dead.  He gives it three more seconds,
eyes riveted on the underside of the helo, knowing they
have to come out... right... fucking... absolutely...

NOW:  Jordan appears with the Chief.  Flea is at their
heels with the co-pilot.

Cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims
for the sky.

The HELO BOOMS back down onto the reef.

Jordan yanks the cord on the Chief's vest.  It inflates
instantly.  One arm raised, Jordan streaks for the
surface...


EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

... and "Supermans" into daylight with the Chief.  They
covered 50 feet in four seconds.

Doing a 360, Jordan spots...

Seafox One coming their way.

Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim.

Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place:
They're wasting no time on the pick-up.

Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a
death-grip on the Chief's vest.

                         THE CHIEF
                  (growling)
          O'Neil...

                         JORDAN
          Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.

The recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring.

SEAFOX THUNDERS past.  Jordan plunges her free arm through
the loop...

And suddenly they're gone, whisked away by the boat.

Throwing a rooster tail a mile long, Seafox pivots on the
water and heads back to base.

                         MCCOOL
          Hoooooo-yah!

          Special Reconnaissance Class 118,
          you may now stand down.

All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites,
the former trainees erupt with ONE GREAT HOO-YAH.  What
began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40.

Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce,
smiling through his fears.  Not far away sits Blondell.
No one claps louder.

Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates.
Pyro finally manages to take her aside.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Lieutenant?  I was asked to give you
          this.

It's a small case.  Jordan opens it to find a medal of
bronze and blue enamel.

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          I believe he earned it for saving a
          man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He
          wanted you to have it.  He was very
          clear on that point.

                         JORDAN
          I was looking for him earlier,
          but...

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          The Chief was granted early
          retirement as of 17-hundred
          yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was
          gone.  Out of the Navy.

                         JORDAN
                  (knowing better)
          Just a coincidence?

                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO
          Maybe it's not my place to speculate
          on his private thoughts.  But I
          think the Chief knew that his way --
          his world -- had come and gone.

Jordan nods, understanding.

                         DEHAVEN
          ... of course, we always prefer
          peace to war.  But if we're going to
          war, give women a piece.  Give them
          the choice to defend their country.
          And if the President doesn't like
          that idea -- if he wants to continue
          to deny women their equal rights --
          then I'll be happy to step out back
          with him any time, anywhere...

Jordan approaches.  Spotting her, the PRESS PLEADS for a
photo-op with both women.

                         DEHAVEN
          Jordan?  Jordan, dear...

Letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn,
Jordan walks right past DeHaven...

And joins Royce.  Together they turn and leave.

                         C.O.
          Senator, perhaps this would be a
          good time for that lunch.  Will the
          America's Cup team be joining us?


EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan and Royce walk hand in hand, strolling the same
beach she trained on.

                         JORDAN
          So here we are again.  Staring three
          years of operational duty in the
          face.

                         ROYCE
          Look.  It's not like you'd be
          completely out of reach.  And maybe
          we could call in a few favors, get
          you stationed at Norfolk instead of
          Coronado.  There are ways of dealing
          with these things -- I mean, if
          people are so inclined.

                         JORDAN
                  (warily)
          Which is guy-speak for...

                         ROYCE
          "Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no
          matter how long."

Finally, the right answer.


EXT.  AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

START TIGHT on Jordan's face.  Even beneath the camouflage
paint, we can see her exhilaration.  PULL BACK to find her
in a line of commandos boarding an IDLING C-130:  She's
embarking on her first mission.  KEEP PULLING BACK until
we've lost her completely -- until she's just one soldier
among many, indistinguishable from the rest.

                                            FADE OUT.

          EXT. THE BASTILLE - PARIS - NIGHT

          A HEAVY NIGHT MIST swirls around the imposing stone walls of
          the Bastille. PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes
          as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows.

          SUPER: PARIS, 1641

          INT. PRISON BLOCK - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT

          A pair of huge PRISON GUARDS walk down a row of filthy prison
          cells. Whimpering, starving PRISONERS appear and disappear in
          the flickering light of the wall torches. A large rat nibbles
          some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards.
          Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose PRISONER is not at
          all whimpering or starving. A huge Scotsman with a proud
          defiance in his eyes, a RED SQUARE MEDALLION dangling around
          his neck, glares through the bars. This is JAMES McCULLEN.
          The guards unlock his cell door, MATCHLOCK MUSKETS at the
          ready. McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed. He speaks
          with a thick Scottish brogue.

          MCCULLEN
          Still using matchlocks, are ya? I
          can get you a pair of flintlocks,
          you let me sneak out of here.
          Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent.

          GUARD #1

          (TEMPTED)
          Good ones?
          The other Guard glares at him. McCullen goes for the kill.

          MCCULLEN
          The best. From Spain. And perhaps a
          couple of pretty young ladies to
          teach you how to use them.
          Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist.

          GUARD #2
          On yer feet, you Scottish pig.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          INT. FURNACE - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT

          Huge, sweaty, bare-chested PRISON WORKERS mould something in
          a furnace, a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs. The
          two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to
          fasten him to a standing rack as a PRIEST begins reciting the
          Lord's Prayer in Latin. The Warden steps up and reads the
          charges off a SCROLL OF PAPER.

          WARDEN
          James McCullen, you have been found
          guilty of treason for the sale of
          military arms to the enemies of our
          Lord King Louis XIII... even whilst
          you sold arms to our Lord himself.

          MCCULLEN
          Your King is a vile bag of filth
          who murders his own allies. I
          should've charged him double.

          WARDEN
          You tried to overthrow the Crown in
          conspiracy with its enemies!

          MCCULLEN
          They offered me a Chancellorship,
          because unlike your simpleton King,
          they know that is the McCullen
          destiny, to run the wars, the true
          power, not simply to supply arms.

          WARDEN
          Do you have anything else to say
          before the sentence is carried out?

          MCCULLEN
          Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far
          bigger and more powerful than any
          of you could ever imagine. My sons
          will continue to rise along after I
          am gone. As will their sons. And,
          God willing, their sons.

          (SMILES)
          It shall not end with my death.
          The Warden smiles back sinisterly.

          WARDEN
          Oh, we're not going to kill you,
          McCullen. We're going to make an
          example of you.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          The Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the
          METALLIC OBJECT from the fire. McCullen sees what it is
          before we do and his face fills with fear. It's a METAL MASK
          being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous
          creak. McCullen begins to struggle against the rack.

          WARDEN (CONT'D)
          So that no man, woman, nor child
          may ever see your treacherous face
          again, you shall wear this mask for
          the term of your natural life.
          The mask closes around his face. The workers melt the lock.
          McCullen SCREAMS. AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE MEDALLION.

          EXT. NATO HEADQUARTERS - BRUSSELS - DAY

          The many flags of NATO flap outside its massive headquarters.

          SUPER: NATO HEADQUARTERS, BELGIUM

          MCCULLEN (V.0.)
          War used to be the exception. Now
          it is the new state of play, a
          constant, unavoidable...

          INT. BRIEFING CHAMBER - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The RED SQUARE MEDALLION around the neck of JAMES McCULLEN,
          gazing over a lectern in a darkened room. Like his doomed
          ancestor, McCullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes.

          MCCULLEN
          Tragic as they are to fight, wars
          must be won. But perhaps they don't
          have to be as destructive as
          they've been in the past.
          A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen
          behind him. McCullen is briefing twenty-two NATO MILITARY
          COMMANDERS, many of them listening in TRANSLATION HEADPHONES.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Nano-mites. Perfect little
          soldiers. Their size can be
          programmed as well as their
          intended task. Originally developed
          to isolate and destroy cancer
          cells, but at Mars Industries, and
          with the help of a little NATO
          funding...

          

          

          

          

          4.
          A few laughs around the room. McCullen soaks it up.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          .we discovered how to program
          them to eliminate most anything.
          For instance... metal.
          ON SCREEN: A SOLDIER fires a shoulder-launched missile at a
          tank. The warhead bursts into millions of SILVER MICROSCOPIC
          NANO-MITES which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a
          horse. Then the NANO-MITES fan out from the consumed tank and
          quickly head for a nearby jeep.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Once the target has been destroyed,
          the launcher triggers a kill switch
          unique to each warhead that short-
          circuits the nano-mites, preventing
          any unwanted destruction.
          ON SCREEN: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the launcher and
          the NANO-MITES instantly "drop dead" around the nearby jeep.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Each warhead contains seven million
          nano-mites and has the ability to
          eat anything from a single tank to
          an entire city.
          (to consummate salesman)
          But without innocent casualties.
          Which is why this has been such a
          priority for me and my company.
          The room breaks into APPLAUSE. FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a
          British veteran or countless battles, not buying it.

          HAWK
          Guess you'll be the first arms
          dealer up for the Nobel Peace
          Prize.
          Laughter in the room. McCullen smiles, being a good sport.

          MCCULLEN
          I prefer the term "armament
          solutions engineer"
          (more chuckles)
          Gentlemen! I'm pleased to announce
          that tomorrow morning your first
          order of nanotech warheads will
          ship from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          INT. MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          FOUR GLASS-LIKE WARHEADS, each the size of a softball, are
          placed into four separate compartments inside a WEAPONS CASE
          by a pair of LAB WORKERS. The KILL SWITCHES are secured next
          to each warhead. As the case is closed and locked we see the
          MARS Industries RED SQUARE MEDALLION LOGO on its cover.

          SUPER: KYRGYZSTAN, CENTRAL ASIA

          INT. MEN'S ROOM - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          A PAIR OF DOG TAGS drop INTO FRAME in SLOW MOTION. We see the
          name: "HAUSER, CONRAD R." Still not seeing his face, we watch
          our soldier strap into his BODY ARMOR and clip on his BATTLE
          HARNESS. His NAME TAG simply reads: "DUKE". He loads his into
          the mirror (is that a look of disdain?) and we get our first
          glimpse of our hero, a handsome, rugged combat veteran with a
          BATTLE SCAR under his right eye.
          The sound of RETCHING comes from the stall behind Duke. There
          is a flush and a strapping young Special Forces Soldier,
          STALWORTH, steps out. He goes to the sink next to Duke and
          splashes water on his face. He's pale and sweaty.

          DUKE
          The hell's wrong with you,
          Stalworth, you didn't eat that
          Chicken A La King at chow did ya?

          STALWORTH
          The mission, sir...

          DUKE
          What about it? Another day, another
          run.

          STALWORTH
          Never had anything to worry about
          before.
          Stalworth's shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to
          Duke: A YOUNG MOTHER with a NEWBORN in her arms.

          STALWORTH (CONT'D)
          Three weeks old. Be seeing him for
          the first time next leave.
          Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth. His eyes go
          distant thinking about his own past, then they harden again.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          DUKE
          You're off the mission.

          STALWORTH
          Sir?

          DUKE
          That's what you want, right?
          Stalworth doesn't argue. Duke hands him back the photo.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          If your head's with them, you're no
          good to me.
          Stalworth nods. Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          One thing, though: you step off
          this one, you're out of Special
          Forces. Gonna find you a nice desk
          and chair back at the base. You're
          be run of the mill. Regular.

          STALWORTH
          I... I guess I can live with that.

          DUKE
          Then you should.
          Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves. Duke's hard eyes
          watch him go, then a slight smile creases his lips ...

          INT. CORRIDOR - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen exits the briefing room into the corridor outside,
          shaking hands with various Military Commanders. Hawk watches
          with his aide, a gorgeous German Lieutenant, COURTNEY "COVER
          GIRL" KRIEGER. When McCullen is alone, Hawk makes his move.

          HAWK
          Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy,
          British Army.

          MCCULLEN
          (shaking hands)
          I know who you are General hawk. As
          sharp in a briefing room as your
          reputation is on the battlefield.

          

          

          

          

          7.

          HAWK
          Not hardly ...You gave me a broad
          target, I couldn't resist.

          MCCULLEN
          It's an honor to meet a man of your
          many accomplishments.
          McCullen smiles, then offers Hawk to walk with him.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          What's on your mind, General?

          HAWK
          Your warheads. Securing them in
          transit. Forty pairs of ears in
          that room now know the when and
          where.

          MCCULLEN
          Those "ears" all have top security
          clearance.

          HAWK
          We both know what that's worth.

          MCCULLEN
          Look, General, delivery is my
          responsibility and it's not one I
          take lightly. I had NATO assign an
          elite American Special Forces unit,
          a fully armored convoy with air
          support. I assure you, my warheads
          will be quite safe.

          HAWK
          I've made a career of showing up
          where I'm needed, whether ordered
          to or not. And if your warheads are
          half as effective as you say they
          are.. Then my unit is needed.

          MCCULLEN
          This is no time to play catch up.
          The NATO team's been drilling for
          weeks. They're lit up and ready to
          roll.

          HAWK
          My unit doesn't need mission
          specific training. They're chosen
          because of their ability to handle
          any situation.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          MCCULLEN
          Maybe next time, General...
          (moves to go, stops)
          What did you say your unit was
          called?

          HAWK
          I didn't. I just said they were
          always ready.
          McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a
          look, she reads it and nods. WE SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. HIGH-TECH DELIVERY BAY - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          A FOUR MAN SECURITY DETAIL escorts two LAB WORKERS as they
          enter a high-tech delivery bay and wlak past two "COUGAR"
          PATROL VEHICLES and a huge ARMORED "GRIZZLY TRUCK, all armed
          with state-of-the-art rooftop weapons. FIFTEEN SPECIAL FORCES
          SOLDIERS stand at attention in front of Duke.

          DUKE
          All right, listen up, the Cougars
          will be front and back, Grizzly in
          the middle carrying the package.
          Minimum distance at all times.
          Choppers will cover us overhead.
          The Lab Workers step up.

          LAB WORKER #1
          Captain Hauser.
          Duke turns to them and start signing forms as WALLACE
          "RIPCORD" WEEMS takes the case while a little short on
          academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence, charm, and
          courage. These two guys are as close as brothers, for better
          and for worse. Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin.

          RIPCORD
          Not gonna explode, is it?

          LAB WORKER
          (dead serious)
          They're not weaponized yet. And the
          kill switches are attached to the
          launchers. All the same, I'd avoid
          potholes if I were you.
          Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another
          soldier. Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what?

          

          

          

          

          9.

          RIPCORD
          Why not stick it in a chopper and
          fly it out? If you want, I could--

          DUKE
          --We have our orders. Okay, people!
          We're on the clock, let's move.

          RIPCORD

          MOUNT UP!
          Duke gives Rip another look. Rip throws him a cheesy grin.
          The team mounts up. The weapons case to Grizzly. ENGINES
          ignite. HEADLIGHTS beam. And the convoy rolls out.

          EXT. MARS FACTORY - KYRGYZSTAN - NIGHT

          The convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates,
          passing a sign: "MILITARY ARMAMENTS RESEARCH SYNDICATE". Two
          BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS swoop in and follow the convoy.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          Ripcord drives the lead Cougar, Duke beside him. Two more
          guys in back, remotely panning a rooftop DUAL MACHINE GUN.

          DUKE
          (into radio)
          Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We
          have the package and are on the dot
          to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900.

          RIPCORD
          You know, I hate all the Mother
          Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish
          they'd let us say, "Hey, Pete, it's
          Bill, see ya in a few."

          DUKE
          Not me, I joined up for the jargon.

          VOICE ON RADIO
          Roger that, Bird Dog. Mother Goose
          out.

          RIPCORD
          Just saying, you know, if I ran
          things...

          

          

          

          

          10.

          DUKE
          Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay
          up all night, fill our canteen with
          tequila, and call each other "Bro".

          RIPCORD
          But we'd be badasses, right Bro?

          DUKE
          (with a sigh)
          Yeah, we'd be badasses. Eyes on the
          road, Rip.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

          The two Blackhawks sweep through the skies, silhouetted by
          the rising sun. Below them, the convoy is thundering down a
          winding road amid the magnificent Tian Shan Mountain Range.

          INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A RADAR DISH on the rear Cougar sweeps vigilantly. Inside, a
          SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER watches the RADAR MONITOR, clear
          except for two steady :signatures", the Blackhawks.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          In the lead Cougar, Duke and Ripcord keep their eyes out.

          RIPCORD
          Hey Duke, ya know how they always
          tell you to empty your head of
          distracting thoughts on these runs?

          DUKE
          Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.

          RIPCORD
          And you know how people sometimes
          joke that it must be easy fr me to
          keep my mind empty?

          DUKE
          Don't listen to 'em. you got plenty
          of thoughts up there.
          (into radio)
          Keep rear security tight, boys.

          

          

          

          

          11.

          RIPCORD
          Well, the second I try and make
          myself not have thoughts, I always
          have 'em. Like now, know what I'm
          thinking about?

          DUKE
          Please don't say the Air Forces.

          RIPCORD
          The Air Forces.

          DUKE
          I thought we were done with that
          discussion.

          RIPCORD
          You were done with it, not me.
          Look, I loev flying...
          Duke "mouths" the following sentence as Ropcord says it:

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          I've been flying since I was
          thirteen years old.
          Ripcord shoots him a look. Duke just smiles.

          DUKE
          I don't think your daddy's crop
          duster counts as hours logged.

          RIPCORD
          Jets, man, jets. You know I always
          qualify when I'm on leave.

          DUKE
          Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get
          up in the air, we'll get you a
          trampoline back at the base.

          RIPCORD
          We've done ten years in the Army, I
          just think we should see if the
          grass really is greener.

          DUKE
          This continues to be the stupidest
          idea you've ever come up with, nd
          that's saying something.

          RIPCORD
          Funny. Real funny.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          DUKE
          I don't wanna transfer to the Air
          Force, okay?

          RIPCORD
          It's always about you, isn't it?
          Give me one good reason?

          DUKE
          I want to be in the fight, not
          flying over it.

          RIPCORD
          Won't be saying that when you call
          in an air strike and I come
          screaming in to save your--

          DUKE
          --Eyes on the road, Rip.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Behind the Blackhawks and the convoy an ominous, DARK SHAPE
          suddenly drops INTO FRAME. ENGINE EXHAUST blurs our view of
          the aircraft, but we can tell that it's pursuing the convoy.

          INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          On the rear Cougar's RADAR SCREEN, we see the two Blackhawk
          signatures still appearing in position.. .but nothing else.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          They hit a pothole. Ripcord grimaces, then realizes--

          RIPCORD
          Hey, on the training run weren't
          there herders around here?
          This puts Duke instantly on the alert.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Too late. CONCUSSION CANNONS slide out of ports on both sides
          of the dark shape. They fire simultaneously. The SUBATOMIC
          BLASTS punch into the front Blackhawk, crushing it like a
          beer can on your forehead. It explodes and drops.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke and Rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of
          them, blocking the convoy's path. Rip hits the brakes.

          RIPCORD
          Jesus Christ! Bird Down!

          DUKE
          (urgent, but utterly calm)
          Back up! Back up! Back up!
          (into radio)
          Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We
          are under attack. Repeat --we are
          under attack!

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          The second Blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape, --it's
          like a giant helicopter without rotors, hovering on six JET
          THRUSTERS. It's a next-gen "TYPHOON" GUNSHIP.
          The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled MINI-
          GUNS. But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor.
          The CONCUSSION CANNONS fire at the second Blackhawk, catching
          it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending
          it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the
          rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy.
          The Grizzly launches two HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES off its roof-
          turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again. The
          blast lands directly on top of the rear Cougar, literally
          flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke sees it all in his rear view mirror, yells into RADIO:

          DUKE
          Out! Everyone get out of the
          vehicles! Now!

          INT./EXT. GRIZZLY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A final CONCUSSION BLAST lands between the last two vehicles
          now. Spinning the Grizzly. It's WINDOWS SHATTER and a
          thousand lethal GLASS SHARDS shoot inside, killing the
          drivers. The Cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord land on the upturned ceiling, beat to shit.
          Duke quickly checks on the two guys in back crushed to death
          where the blast caved in the Cougar's armor. He looks at Rip.

          DUKE
          You okay?

          RIPCORD

          (DAZED)
          Yeah, except for all the blood.
          Duke sees blood on the back of Rip's head. Then they hear a
          LOUD ROAR and turn to see the Typhoon hover by the Grizzly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Who the hell is that?
          Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A SIDE DOOR on the Typhoon hisses open to reveal six
          "VIPERS", menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black
          BATTLE ARMOR, and armed with fearsome PULSE RIFLES. They exit
          the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left.
          The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly OPEN FIRE
          with ASSAULT RIFLES, but the bullets can't penetrate the
          Viers' armor. The Vipers fire back, the impact from their
          pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and
          fling them backwards.
          Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them
          toward the Typhoon. The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the
          air with their pulse rifles. It EXPLODES well out of range as
          the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the
          pack. Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six
          feet underground. A DULL WHOOMP, lifts the ground by a foot.
          Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon. Long,
          slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in
          black, form-fitting BODY ARMOR. She's beautiful, exotic, and
          most of all, lethal. She's known in certain circles only as
          "THE BARONESS" but we will know her as ANA. Her DARK GLASSES
          glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly.
          The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up
          to shoot her. But she quick-draws a pair of PULSE PISTOLS.
          BOOM! BOOM! The shots crush both soldiers.

          

          

          

          

          15.
          Ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows
          the back door off the Grizzly, allowing her to climb inside.
          She blithely steps around the corpses and removes the WEAPONS

          CASE.
          Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell.

          RIPCORD
          Duke?

          DUKE
          Shut up.

          RIPCORD
          If I die...

          DUKE
          You're not gonna die.

          RIPCORD
          I just want you to know... you never
          could run worth a damn.

          DUKE
          Jesus, Rip.

          RIPCORD
          I'm just saying, it's be nice if
          you could move a little faster.
          And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast. Ana
          turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go
          ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of
          her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke.
          DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.

          DUKE
          Stay here.

          RIPCORD
          (really messed up)
          Sure.

          DUKE
          I'm gettin' that package.
          Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs
          up the embankment. --And comes face to face with a Viper, who
          raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away. A hand
          clamps down over the barrel.
          The Viper looks at Ana beside him. Duke also looks at her, a
          flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face.

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the DARK LENSES turn
          clear, revealing her gorgeous eyes.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          What the hell...?
          Her face softens hesitantly.

          ANA
          Hello, Duke...
          Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face,
          knocks him out on his ass.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          You have to admit you had that
          coming.
          Ana struggles with something going on inside her head. Then
          her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the
          first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Good-bye, Duke.
          Duke can't believe it. Ana suddenly glances up at something
          behind Duke. It's a "HOWLER" TRANSPORT rocketing onto the
          scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety degrees
          to slow it into a hover. Duke takes the opportunity to jump
          to his feet and lay out in the Viper. Ana turns and hauls-
          ass.
          A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and
          lands behind a Viper and SNAPS his neck. Moving in a blur, he
          draws and buries a KATANA BLADE into another Viper. Then he
          glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far
          away to reach with his sword. He quick-draws a GLOCK PISTOL.
          BAM! Right between the eye slit in his helmet. All this in
          the space of six breathless seconds.
          Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES
          sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking
          Glock. RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep. Bad-ass
          defined. Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse
          burst just missed him. Duke immediately takes off after Ana,
          his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, PULSE
          BURSTS crackling past his head. He curses under his breath:

          DUKE
          Air Force.. .right.

          

          

          

          

          17.
          A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips
          through his eye-slit and ELECTROCUTES him, courtesy of SHANA
          "SCARLETT" O'HARA who fast-ropes down from the Howler,
          holding a gas-propulsion CROSSBOW PISTOL. She lines up on
          another Viper, but he's too quick, ducks behind the GRIZZLY.
          But Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL viewfinder snapped an image of
          his FACE ARMOR. She darts behind the COUGAR WRECK with Snake-
          Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's
          LED SCREEN. Then she fires behind her, in the complete other
          direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns
          around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover,
          the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit.
          Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but
          LAMONT "HEAVY DUTY" MORRIS leans out of the landing Howler
          holding a dual MACHINE GUN/GRENADE LAUNCHER. Only a man this
          big can carry such a weapon.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Time to lay down some bass!
          He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME. You
          blink, you miss it. BOOM! The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty,
          but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its LEFT-SIDE
          THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side. The CONCUSSION BLASTS
          whip past and decimate the forest behind it. Hanging
          awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades.
          The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air.
          The Howler fires MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS
          and rip them apart. The Typhoon SHAKES. Ana races for the
          recovering Typhoon. Duke races after her through a hail of
          pulse-fire and draws his PISTOL.

          DUKE
          Ana!
          She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest
          and face, using it as a shield. Duke hesitates, because of
          the warheads or Ana? Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.

          SCARLETT
          The warheads!
          Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana
          backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon. Duke charges like a
          bull and tackles her. Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free.
          Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes
          after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray
          gunfire her way. Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon,
          which is raked by the bullets.

          

          

          

          

          18.
          Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky
          and disappears over a rise ...
          SILENCE... Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach
          Duke, who whirls around at them, pistol up, eyes wild.

          DUKE
          Stand down! Stand the hell down!

          HEAVY DUTY
          Lower your weapon, Sir. We're not
          the enemy.

          DUKE
          Pointing weapons at me doesn't make
          you my friend.
          ABEL "BREAKER" SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a
          computerized SURVEILLANCE SUIT, a French/Tunisian ACCENT:

          BREAKER
          Please hand over the case, sir.

          DUKE
          I don't know who you are, and I
          sure as hell don't know who they
          are, and until I find out, I'm not
          lowering anything or handling
          anything over.
          CLICK-CLACK. They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle.

          RIPCORD
          What's your unit?

          SCARLETT
          That's classified.
          Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his
          belt, but a look from Scarlett makes him out them back.

          BREAKER
          Someone would like a word with you.
          Breaker sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke,
          which projects a 3D IMAGE OF GENERAL HAWK. Duke is stunned.

          HAWK
          State you name and rank.

          DUKE
          .you first.

          

          

          

          

          19.

          HAWK
          My team just saved your life. now's
          the part where you say "thank you".

          DUKE
          Those aren't the words that come to
          mind just now. We weren't told
          about any support for this mission,
          so you better tell your team to
          stand down.
          Ripcord eyes his sight.

          RIPCORD
          Happy to turn this into a turkey
          shoot.
          Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.

          HAWK
          You must be... Ripcord, expert
          marksman, weapons specialist, jet

          QUALIFIED--

          RIPCORD
          (to Duke)
          Told ya.

          HAWK
          I'm General Clayton Abernathy. You
          may have heard of me, .Duke.
          A glint of recognition flickers across Duke's eyes, he nods.

          DUKE
          General hawk. Afghanistan, NATO
          Forward Command...
          Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and
          starts sweeping a scanner across the case. Hawk smiles.

          HAWK
          That was my last job.
          (a twinkle in his eye)
          I'm in a whole new outfit now.
          Duke swivels his gun to Breaker's head. Breaker flinches.

          BREAKER
          Just need to deactivate its
          tracking beacon, for security.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          HAWK
          Hand over the weapons case son, and
          let us deliver the warheads.

          DUKE
          No way. I signed for 'em. My
          mission, my package. I carry them,
          I deliver them.
          Breaker's scanner BEEPS. He keys a button. The BEEPING
          promptly stops. He throws a look at Duke.

          BREAKER
          Wasn't hard, was it?

          DUKE
          Fine. But you seem to be a little
          short on transportation a the
          moment. Team Alpha will deliver you
          to me.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          And where exactly are you, General?

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Hawk stands in front of a HOLO-CAM amongst a sea of
          computers, Cover Girl behind him, Duke on a monitor.

          HAWK
          Come see for yourself.

          EXT. HOWLER - EGYPTIAN SKIES - DUSK

          The Howler skims over the GIANT PYRAMIDS OF GIZA, a caravan
          of camels below. The aircraft continues out into the golden
          desert, too fast for anybody to get a good look at it.

          INT. HOWLER -SKIES - DUSK

          Scarlett is cleaning Ripcord's head wound.

          RIPCORD
          Hey, you're cute.

          SCARLETT
          He's going into shock.

          RIPCORD
          What's your name, darlin'?

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Snake-Eyes stabs Ripcord hard int he arm with a drip-needle,
          Rip angrily eyeballs him and stifles a scream.

          SCARLETT
          I thought all the Special Ops guys
          were tough.

          RIPCORD
          We are tough ... . but also sensitive.
          (feeling the drugs)
          Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff
          you gave me.
          Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares
          back at him. Rip reaches out to touch his well-cropped hair.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          .and a kung-fu grip.

          HEAVY DUTY
          The name's Heavy Duty.
          Duke has the weapons case on his lap.

          DUKE
          What kind of outfit is this? Not
          regular Army based on the accents.
          (to Scarlett)
          I have you as an Aussie...
          (looks to Heavy Duty)
          And you're a Johannesburger...
          (then Breaker)
          And you: French North Africa.
          Algiers?

          BREAKER
          Tunisia. Where were you born?

          RIPCORD
          Are you kidding me? Duke wasn't
          born, he was Government-Issued!

          DUKE
          But somehow you're all in the same
          unit. One you can't tell me the
          name of right?

          SCARLETT
          We'd get tossed for telling.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          RIPCORD
          Duke, Duke, don't you get it:
          they're super secret, they're
          Mission Impossible. This tape's
          gonna self-destruct in five--

          DUKE
          --You're gonna go after them aren't
          you? The ones that hit my convoy.

          (SILENCE)
          Then whoever you are, whatever this
          unit is, I want in.

          BREAKER
          Not our call.
          Ripcord sits up, really woozy, looks at Scarlett.

          RIPCORD
          I want in too. That way we can
          spend some bunker time together.
          A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away. It's
          Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent. But the
          message is not lost on Ripcord. Scarlett looks at Duke.

          SCARLETT
          You two a team or something?

          RIPCORD
          We've been together forever.
          (off her look)
          But not like that. Hi, I'm Ripcord.

          SCARLETT
          Why do they call you that?
          Breaker laughs, reading Ripcord's file:

          BREAKER
          Because his name is Wallace Weems!

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Eight SECURITY TECHNICIANS sit around an island console in a
          small, windowless room. Working their keyboards and watching
          the HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE of the Howler soaring across the dunes.
          A technician hits a LARGE SWITCH on his console.

          SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1
          Alpha-One, this is Base. You are
          cleared or entry.

          

          

          

          

          23.

          EXT. HOWLER - SKIES - DAY

          And a huge sand dune directly in front of Howler spirals open
          to reveal a CAVERNOUS HOLE. The Howler's THRUSTERS twist
          vertical and it drops like a helicopter into the hole.
          SUPER: Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity.

          INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY

          The Howler descends beneath the surface onto a dark platform
          as the roof spirals shut and FLOOD LIGHTS switch on. The door
          of the howler opens and the team steps out. Duke and Ripcord
          follow hesitantly with the weapons case. A VOICE calls out to
          them from the shadows:

          HAWK (O.S.)
          Welcome to the new Pit!
          Duke and Ripcord turn to see hawk and Cover girl walking out
          from behind the lights.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          Duke.

          DUKE
          General.

          HAWK
          I've read a lot about you two.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, look, I didn't "steal" that
          Blackhawk, I was borrowing it...
          Duke shoots him a look. Hawk steps right up to Duke.

          HAWK
          Matter of fact, I saw that one of
          my subordinates tried to recruit
          you to our little operation a while
          back.

          DUKE
          I was never asked to join any Op
          group.

          HAWK
          Remember a tall gentleman
          approaching you in Thailand when
          you were on leave, four years ago?

          

          

          

          

          24.

          DUKE
          Vaguely.

          HAWK
          Right before you tore up the bar?

          RIPCORD
          Four years? My man had some issues.
          Duke shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk.

          DUKE
          This doesn't look like any Tac Op
          I've ever seen. Where are we?

          HAWK
          Okay, you trusted me by going with
          my team, so I'll trust you.
          There's a loud METALLIC CLANG and part of the PLATFORM begins
          to descend. They pass the URBAN COMBAT LEVEL where MEN and
          WOMEN are training with next-gen urban warfare equipment.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          Technically, GI JOE doesn't exist.
          But if it did, it'd be comprised of
          the top men and women from the best
          military units all over the world.
          The alpha dogs...
          They see a pretty woman sip into a next-gen CAMO-SUIT, which
          reflects and refracts light, making her nearly invisible.

          RIPCORD
          Oh man, I want one of those.

          BREAKER
          The suit or the girl?

          RIPCORD
          Both.
          Scarlett's eyes roll. They descend into the DESERT COMBAT
          level, where soldiers train with desert warfare equipment.

          HAWK
          Ten nations signed on in their
          first year. Working together,
          sharing intel. Now we have twenty-
          three.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          DUKE
          I've never seen combat gear this
          sleek, what's the trick?

          SCARLETT
          Liquid armor.
          They reach the DEEP SEA COMBAT LEVEL where dozens of men and
          women are testing fantastic next-gen UNDERWATER VEHICLES.

          HAWK (O.S.)
          Good news is we've been pretty
          successful so far. The bad news is
          whenever we manage to shut down one
          organization, another springs up in
          its place.

          RIPCORD
          Who could possibly fund all this?

          HEAVY DUTY
          Oprah.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Hawk now leads the group into the Control Room where more
          TECHNICIANS man consoles. Duke still has the weapons case.

          CONTROL ROOM TECHNICIAN #1
          Mr. McCullen's standing by, Sir.

          HAWK
          Patch him through, please.

          DUKE
          So who hit us out there?

          COVER GIRL
          Currently unidentified.

          HEAVY DUTY
          And how'd that bitch in leather get
          a jump jet like ours?

          SCARLETT
          Whoever she is, she's clearly well-
          financed, with access to highly
          classified intel and state of the
          art weaponry. Their capabilities
          are beyond anything we've ever
          encountered.

          

          

          

          

          26.

          RIPCORD
          That's the reason we got our asses
          kicked.
          Duke betrays nothing. Hawk looks at him.

          HAWK
          We're going to need to find out
          everything we can about her.
          Knowing is half the battle.

          RIPCORD
          What's the other half?
          McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Jesus!
          And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR.
          A ring of cameras provides him with images of the Joes.

          HAWK
          Gentlemen, this is James McCullen,
          CEO of MARS Industries, the man who
          built these warheads.
          WE INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH McCullen standing in front of a
          HOLO-CAM in a small room somewhere. THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES of
          hawk, Duke, and the others around him.

          MCCULLEN
          General, most men I've encountered
          in this business over-promise and
          under-deliver. You're the opposite.
          Clearly, you were the security
          option I should have chosen.
          ON DUKE: Steaming behind his military demeanor.

          DUKE
          My team did everything we could out
          there. A lot of good men went down--

          MCCULLEN
          --But not you.

          DUKE
          That mission was classified, sir.
          Clearly, somebody sold us out.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          MCCULLEN
          I've spent ten years and thirteen
          billion Euros creating these four
          warheads. Your job, Captain, was to
          protect them, and if it wasn't for
          General Hawk, you would've failed.

          HAWK
          That's not a fair assessment. He
          followed his orders to the letter.

          MCCULLEN
          Well that wasn't enough.
          Duke bristles. McCullen turns to Hawk.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          What are your coordinates? I'll
          have NATO send another special ops
          team to retrieve the warheads,
          company strength this time.

          HAWK
          Apologizes, Mr McCullen. It's not
          that I don't trust you...I don't
          trust anybody.

          MCCULLEN

          (SMILES)
          Are you sure you're not a McCullen?

          HAWK
          I don't talk smooth enough to be a
          McCullen.

          MCCULLEN
          You do just fine, General. Now, so
          the bastards who attacked you can't
          find you, you need to disable the
          tracking beacon hidden in the case.

          BREAKER
          We already have.

          MCCULLEN
          Good man. So, can I count on you to
          deliver the warheads to NATO now?

          HAWK
          I think it unwise to expose them at
          the moment. This group might make
          another attempt.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          28.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          We need to find and neutralize them
          before we can consider moving your
          weapons.

          MCCULLEN
          Alright. But allow me to check the
          warheads to see if any have been
          damaged.
          Duke begrudgingly sets the case down. Breaker turns on his
          suit's BALL-EYEPIECE. It goes into X-RAY MODE and we see the
          NANO-MITES crawling around inside the four warheads.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Open it, please.

          BREAKER
          My scan says they're intact...

          MCCULLEN
          General?

          HAWK
          What's the code?
          ON DUKE, listening carefully.

          MCCULLEN
          Five-two-nine-four-four-oh.
          Breaker enters the code. As the case opens, Breaker
          discreetly watches McCullen in his BALL-EYEPIECE SCANNER.
          McCullen runs his holographic fingers over the warheads.
          Satisfied, he turns to Hawk.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Please keep me informed of your
          progress, General.
          Duke and McCullen share a quick glare. And then McCullen cuts
          the feed. Scarlett notices concern on Breaker's face.

          SCARLETT
          Breaker?

          BREAKER
          That bloke's Beta waves were going
          up, down, and sideways... I think
          he's hiding something.
          And off the faces of the rest of the group WE CUT BACK TO:

          

          

          

          

          29.

          INT./EXT TRIDENT - DAY

          McCullen turns as Ana appears on a HOLO-PROJECTOR behind him.

          MCCULLEN
          I spend five years setting this up.
          Wringing money out of NATO. This
          was supposed to be the easy part.

          ANA
          If you'd let me stage the assault
          at your precious factory, we could
          have contained the situation.

          MCCULLEN
          And lost the trust of our clients
          in the process? It had to be NATO's
          fault.
          (steps closer)
          What happened? Did you hesitate?

          ANA
          You're implying this was about some
          ancient history? That's as
          laughable as your Intel. What went
          wrong was the Joes appearing out of
          nowhere.
          He stares at her suspiciously, then softens.

          MCCULLEN
          Forgive me, jealousy isn't my
          strong suit.

          ANA
          Forget that, where are we now? Have
          you tracked the case?

          MCCULLEN
          They deactivated the beacon. I gave
          them a code to quietly re-arm it.
          McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on, displaying A MAP
          OF THE WORLD. A BEACON LIGHT flashes over a spot in the
          Egyptian desert, grip coordinates blinking.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          There it is. The infamous Pit.

          ANA
          I will get those warheads back.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          McCullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face, his
          hand going right through her. McCullen whispers menacingly.

          MCCULLEN
          I hope so.

          ANA
          (diffusing the threat)
          If I were really there, I might
          actually let you touch me.

          MCCULLEN
          (sly smile)
          I'll send a jet.

          ANA
          Business first. Besides, I'm
          married, remember?
          Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.

          MCCULLEN
          Sometimes I really hate technology.
          He sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:

          STORM SHADOW (O.S.)
          It is most often used by those
          without honor.
          McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean
          man whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other
          side of the room.

          MCCULLEN
          There can't be any more mistakes.
          The schedule can't be compromised
          any further.

          STORM SHADOW
          If you had sent me, it would be
          done.

          MCCULLEN
          (walking towards him)
          I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
          To the Baroness's villa. .Make
          sure her commitment doesn't waiver.
          Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him. We now
          realize Storm Shadow was a holo-proj. Storm Shadow vanishes.

          

          

          

          

          31.
          McCullen steps up to a large oval perspex window. WE PULL
          BACK out of the window to reveal that he's riding through
          DEEP ARCTIC OCEAN inside a next-gen "TRIDENT" submarine.
          CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK to show the Trident approaching the
          docking bay of a MASSIVE FACILITY built into the seabed under
          the jagged canopy of the POLAR ICE CAP. The place is defended
          by several HARPOON CANNONS and a fearsome TURBO-LASER. It's a
          breath-taking sight, but also a little frightening.

          INT. DOCKING BAY - DAY

          The MARS LOGO is stamped on a pair of WATER-TIGHT DOORS. The
          logo pulls apart as the doors open, allowing McCullen inside
          the docking back entrance. Waiting for him is a man known
          only as THE DOCTOR. His face hidden by a life-support mask
          that continually pumps air into his lungs and also
          mechanically helps him to speak without the vocal chords he
          is missing.

          THE DOCTOR
          Welcome back.

          MCCULLEN
          Good to be back.

          THE DOCTOR
          we've been very busy.
          He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all
          standing at attention, not a single muscle moving among them.
          These are NEO-VIPERS. The baddest of the bad.

          MCCULLEN
          Is it working?

          THE DOCTOR
          You tell me.
          The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a
          glass case containing an eighteen foot long KING COBRA. the
          Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          The King Cobra is a magnificent
          creature. Its venom can kill a
          full grown elephant with a single
          bite.
          He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing
          its hood. The Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows
          McCullen an INCISION SCAR behind the Neo-Vipers' right ears.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          We introduced into each subject one
          thousand cc's of the nano-mite
          solution. As expected, subjects
          became extremely ill and fell into
          a coma-like state for approximately
          forty hours.
          The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket,
          A FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device's screen.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          When they returned to sentience,
          brain scans showed complete
          inactivity in the self-preservation
          region of the cortex.

          MCCULLEN
          English, Doctor.
          The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps
          up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal.

          THE DOCTOR
          They feel no fear.
          The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites
          his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins. The
          Neo-Viper doesn't even wince.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Cortical nerve clusters revealed
          complete inactivity--

          MCCULLEN
          --Doctor.

          THE DOCTOR
          They feel no pain.
          The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently
          lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Frontal lobe concepts of morality
          are disengaged... No remorse...

          MCCULLEN
          And they are completely obedient?

          THE DOCTOR
          Of course. .The real world
          applications are endless.

          

          

          

          

          33.
          The Neo-Viper's knees give out. McCullen watches curiously.
          WE SMASH CUT INTO the NEO-VIPER'S BITE WOUND where the WHITE
          VENOM is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins.

          THE DOCTOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The nano-mites will target the
          venom.
          STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES
          rushing to meet the venom head on. Blocking it.
          Then swiftly pushing it back. All the way to the original
          fang holes. The venom seeps out of the holes and drips off
          the Neo-Viper's arm. He stands and returns to his place in
          line without a word. The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          So you tell me: is it working?

          INT. CORRIDORS - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors.

          THE DOCTOR
          The science is staggering isn't it?

          MCCULLEN
          You've done well. You've thrown the
          caber clear out of the yard.

          THE DOCTOR
          But research and science are
          expensive propositions. If I can
          make a suggestion..?
          McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly
          menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Selling one batch of warheads on
          the black market could fund--

          MCCULLEN
          --I appreciate your thirst for
          knowledge, Doctor. But this world
          is messy enough. Factions fighting
          and scrabbling for control, for
          resources, and it's only going to
          get worse as the century
          progresses. No. What the world
          needs is unification. Leadership.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          34.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          It needs to be taken out of chaos
          by someone with complete control.
          He looks through a portal into a shadowy OPERATING CHAMBER,
          where a brilliant but vicious looking MAN is being scanned by
          SMART ROBOTS. This is ZARTAN. A Smart Robot begins to change
          Zartan's fingerprints, which we see on a monitor.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          My family was once this close to
          that kind of power...

          (LAUGHS)
          The French...
          Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod. McCullen
          looks back at the Doctor.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Once I get my hands on the reins,
          the money will take care of itself.
          You'll be able to do all the
          research you want.
          McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          Duke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a PHOTO OF ANA
          from the ambush, now up on a monitor.

          BREAKER
          We grabbed an image from Heavy-
          Duty's helmet cam.
          Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers:

          RIPCORD
          Hey, that's--
          Duke cuts him off with a look. Breaker extracts a full 3D
          FRONT-VIEW of Ana's face from the photo. Then on an adjacent
          monitor, he runs an endless series of PHOTOS OF WOMEN.

          BREAKER
          Now we can run the face through an
          infinity scan.

          HAWK
          We have access to any photograph on
          any server anywhere in the world.

          

          

          

          

          35.

          BREAKER
          Everyone gets photographed in some
          way at some time. ATM machines,
          airports, crowd shots at a football
          game. We'll find her.
          Duke just stares at Ana's photo. Ripcord whispers quietly:

          RIPCORD
          You okay?

          DUKE
          (not okay)
          .what happened to her?
          For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say. Cover Girl walks
          in and hands a document to Hawk, who looks through it.

          HAWK
          From NATO. I am now the official
          custodian of the warheads. Your
          mission is complete. Once you hand
          it over, that is.
          Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat.

          DUKE
          When you move it, she's gonna come
          after you, you know that, right?
          (off Hawk's look)
          And with her Intel, and her toys...
          she'll find you.

          HAWK
          And your point is...?

          DUKE
          You're going to go after her first.
          And I want to help.

          RIPCORD
          Let us in on this, General. Our
          team just got wasted. I think a
          little payback is in order.

          HAWK
          You don't ask to be a part of GI
          JOE. You get asked.

          DUKE
          You scouted me four years ago, now
          I'm ready. Let's have at it.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HAWK
          I've lost men too, Captain. Good
          men. But attempting to--

          DUKE
          I know her.

          HAWK
          Excuse me?

          DUKE
          You said knowing is half the
          battle. Well, I know who she is.
          Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows
          Hawk. INSERT PHOTO: Ana, four years earlier, much softer
          looking, staring lovingly at Duke as they're about to kiss.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can
          tell you everything you need to
          know about her until... four years
          ago. After that, well, obviously
          sa lot's changed.
          Hawk just stares in disbelief.

          INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - DAY

          Hawk sits down behind his desk and looks up at Duke, still
          standing at attention.

          HAWK
          Before this goes any further, I
          need to know what I'm dealing with,
          a man looking to settle a score, or
          a man who can put the mission
          first. Because the battlefield is
          the wrong place for emotion.
          (he pauses for effect)
          Could you kill her?

          DUKE
          If I had to.

          HAWK
          Chances are you will. But if you
          flinch, hesitate even an instant...
          what I'm trying to say is, unless
          you can kill her graveyard dead I
          don't want you.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          DUKE
          I can.
          (off Hawk's look)
          I signed on to deliver those
          warheads, General, and despite your
          present authority, I want to finish
          the job.
          Hawk regards him for a moment.

          HAWK
          So tell me about her.

          DUKE
          Okay, I'll start right here: I hope
          that vault is tight, because she
          always gets what she wants...

          EXT. THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT

          A BLACK, BEEFED-UP SUV drives towards a magnificent mansion
          in the Parisian suburbs. Though the vehicle looks relatively
          harmless, we'll come to know it as a "SCARAB" attack truck.

          SUPER: PARIS, FRANCE

          INT. FOYER - THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT

          Ana enters the mansion. SERVANTS take her coat as her
          handsome, sophisticated and well dressed husband, BARON LEON
          DECOBRAY, glides up to her, very French. They kiss warmly.

          DECOBRAY
          Hello, darling.

          ANA
          How is work at the lab?

          DECOBRAY
          Steady progress.

          ANA
          So the Minister of Defense was
          pleased?

          DECOBRAY
          He was. You know I wish I could
          tell you more...

          ANA
          Of course.

          

          

          

          

          38.

          DECOBRAY
          You were gone a long time. How
          were the shops in Monte Carlo?

          ANA
          I didn't get what I was after.
          They head up the stairs.

          DECOBRAY
          I suppose I should be grateful.

          ANA
          Most husbands would be.

          DECOBRAY
          Most husbands don't have such
          mysterious wives, they know exactly
          where they are and what they do.

          ANA

          (TEASING)
          They think they know.

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE BARONESS' CASTLE - NIGHT

          Ana throws open the double doors to her grand bedroom on a
          high floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower.

          ANA
          I never get over how beautiful...

          DECOBRAY
          (staring at Ana)
          Neither do I.
          She spots Storm Shadow standing in an ante room and quickly
          spins to face her husband. She pulls Decobray close and
          kisses him. Storm Shadow makes a move, but ana warns him off
          with her eyes, She finishes the kiss and looks at Decobray.

          ANA
          Let me change and freshen up and
          I'll meet you for dinner.

          DECOBRAY
          Of course.
          Decobray smiles at her and leaves. The smile falls from
          Ana's face as she spins around and heads for Storm Shadow.

          

          

          

          

          39.

          STORM SHADOW
          Mr. McCullen gave me explicit
          orders to sever the Baron's spine
          if he so much as touched you.

          ANA
          He's my husband, of course he
          touches me. Tell McCullen to grow
          up. Besides, the Baron says his
          work in the lab goes much better
          after we've... touched. And that's
          the important thing.

          STORM SHADOW
          I'll be accompanying you to
          retrieve the warheads this time.
          Along with some of the men the
          Doctor's been working on.

          ANA
          (with distaste)
          The Doctor.

          STORM SHADOW
          We go at dawn.
          Storm Shadow turns and heads out through the doors. Ana
          Stands alone in her room now, she heads over to her dresser
          and opens a hidden drawer. Inside is a SMALL BOX. She opens
          it carefully and gazes at an ENGAGEMENT RING inside.
          Something sad and lonely in her eyes... And WE FLASHBACK TO:

          INT. MILITARY CLUB - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          A crowded military club. OFFICERS and ENLISTED dancing to an
          orchestra. And there's Ana, the most beautiful woman in the
          room. Wearing a black dress. Slightly younger and with none
          of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier. She's dancing
          with Duke who's wearing his officer's DRESS UNIFORM, replete
          with bars and medals. She laughs as Duke whispers something
          in her ear. She's in love. And so is he.
          Ripcord is in a booth, downing shots with four ENLISTED
          WOMEN. He has his arms around two of them and looks loaded.

          RIPCORD
          My hot tub only holds four.

          (COUNTS)
          No, five.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          EXT. VERANDAH - OFFICER'S CLUB - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

          Duke leads Ana outside onto a quiet verandah, the lights of
          Washington shimmering beyond them. He suddenly kneels down
          in front of her, an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box in his hand.
          Ana gasps with shock and joy, tears welling in her eyes.

          DUKE
          I've been wanting to do this before
          we deploy.

          ANA
          Duke...it's beautiful. It's too
          nice you lunatic.

          DUKE
          Only time I'm buying one of these,
          so why not?
          They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws
          up his face, worried?

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Well, what do you say?
          She's too emotional to speak. And then they hear:

          REX (O.S.)
          Say yes, you idiot...!
          Lieutenant REX LEWIS saunters up, MEDICAL INSIGNIA on his
          collar. The look on his face tells us he's happy for them.

          REX (CONT'D)
          .Before I tell my new brother-in-
          law what it's like to share a
          bathroom with you.

          DUKE
          Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.

          REX
          I was coming to offer you a ride
          back to post.

          ANA
          Time already?

          DUKE
          We go at oh-five hundred.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          ANA
          Is it WMDs? It is, right? That's
          why you're pulling Rex out of the

          LAB--

          DUKE
          Ana, we can't--

          ANA
          Yeah, yeah. Classified. Top
          Secret. Have to kill me if you
          told me, blah, blah, blah.

          DUKE
          Speaking of classified information,
          you still haven't answered.

          ANA
          Yes. Of course it's yes. On one

          CONDITION--
          She grabs REX and pulls him down on his knees next to Duke.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Promise me that you won't let my
          genius egghead brother get hurt.
          (looks at Rex)
          He's the only family I've got left.
          (back to Duke)
          Promise me.

          DUKE
          I promise.
          She smiles and holds out her hand. He threads the ring onto
          her trembling finger. Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint
          of instability. Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through shuttered
          doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Jesus, Rip.
          Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:

          RIPCORD
          How was I supposed know she was
          married!?
          (then, notices the ring)
          Nice rock! Hey, are you proposing?

          DUKE
          I'm done proposing.

          

          

          

          

          42.

          ANA
          I already said yes.

          RIPCORD
          Not official until you answer my
          question. Do you love my boy?

          ANA
          Always and forever.
          Ripcord flips open his CELL PHONE and takes the photo of Ana
          that Duke carries with him.

          RIPCORD
          Now I've gotta find someone to love
          me, as many times as possible for
          the next three hours.
          WE PUSH IN ON THE PHOTO, then SMASH CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

          INT. THE PIT - URBAN ENVIRONMENT - DAY

          On Duke, watching Heavy Duty pulling out an ACCELERATOR SUIT.

          HEAVY DUTY
          If you want to join us, you'll need
          to be mission ready, Joe style.
          This is the Mark One Accelerator
          Suit.

          RIPCORD
          What's it accelerate?

          HEAVY DUTY
          You. It'll make you run faster,
          jump higher, and hit harder than
          any of your enemies.
          A TITANIUM BOOT slides over a shoe. COBALT MACHINE PARTS
          snap into place with a HISS over Duke and Rip's arms and
          legs.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          Head-to-toe turbo-hydraulics and
          highly-pressurized pneumatics.
          They both slap on aerodynamic, flying-wing HELMETS. Inside,
          the CYBERNETIC POWER-UP with an ear piercing whine. LASER
          ENHANCED LED readouts scramble and fritz across their HUDs.

          

          

          

          

          43.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          An advanced cybernetics heads-up
          display, feeding into your helmet.
          Duke checks out two gas-propelled GRAPPLING SPEARS and six
          WRIST ROCKETS around his right forearm.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          Two gas propelled grappling spears
          and six ten millimeter, hi-
          explosive, heat seeking, fire-and-
          forget rockers.
          Rip spins the twin barrels of a caseless SUBMACHINE GUN on
          his left forearm. A Cheshire grin spreads across his face.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          And a nine millimeter, caseless
          submachine gun with six hundred
          rounds capable of firing all of
          them in thirty seconds.
          Duke and Ripcord are now buckled in, getting a feel for the
          FLEXIBLE, POLY-ALLOY SUITS. Ripcord glances at Heavy Duty.

          RIPCORD
          I just missed everything you said.
          (turns to Duke)
          How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?

          INT. TARGET RANGE - URBAN COMBAT LEVEL - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord run through and URBAN ENVIRONMENT OBSTACLE
          COURSE, 3D HOLO-PROJECTION TERRORISTS lunging out at them.
          The guys take them out one by one, never more than a split
          second after they appear. The HOLO-PROJECTIONS fritz and
          die. They reach the end of the and a BUZZER SOUNDS. At the
          back, arms crossed, impassively taking it all in, is Hawk.
          Scarlett approaches the guys with an ELECTRONIC CLIPBOARD.

          SCARLETT
          Sixty-three seconds. Not Bad. But
          not good enough. Gotta get under a
          minute to qualify.

          DUKE
          What's the record?

          SCARLETT
          Forty-five.

          

          

          

          

          44.

          RIPCORD
          Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes?

          SCARLETT
          No, me.
          Ripcord glances at Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL.

          RIPCORD
          You can do this whole course with
          that thing in forty-five seconds?

          SCARLETT
          If you're going to shoot at
          something, kill it. Otherwise take
          up knitting.

          RIPCORD
          When I want something, I don't just
          shoot at it...
          (steps close to her)
          When I get a target in my sights, I
          take it down.
          His meaning is clear. She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine
          into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and hands it to him.

          SCARLETT
          Here. Go on. Try it.

          RIPCORD
          I wouldn't want to show you up.

          SCARLETT
          Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.

          RIPCORD
          What can I tell you? I guess I'm
          just a considerate, humble guy.
          You'll learn that about me.

          SCARLETT
          I'm the "target in your sights,"
          right? You've got ten rounds to
          "take me down".

          RIPCORD
          I don't want to hurt you.

          SCARLETT
          They're training arrows. The most
          I'll feel is a little jolt.

          

          

          

          

          45.
          Scarlett walks back and faces him. He glances aside at Duke
          who is loving this. Ripcord readies the pistol. Scarlett
          darts left. He shoots and misses. She darts right. He
          misses.

          DUKE
          C'mon, Rip.
          Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best. But Scarlett
          us too fast. Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble
          as a cat. Five more shots miss her. And now Ripcord's
          feeling the pressure. He waits for her to move. Fires. She
          leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath.
          He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to
          him. He fires his last bolt point blank. She catches it in
          her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber. Slamming
          her body up against his. Right hand behind his head, left
          hand holding the bolt. Their faces close. Lips closer.
          Ripcord's eyes on hers as he whispers:

          SCARLETT
          Guess you didn't really want me
          that bad, rip.
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she
          walks away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the
          ground and EXPLODES. Ripcord and Duke jump back. Ripcord
          glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine. Three
          words: "CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS".
          Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the
          course, awestruck. Breaker walks by eating a burrito and
          watching his bio-rhythm display.

          BREAKER
          Aw, Ripcord's heart just skipped a
          beat. Isn't that sweet?

          EXT. THE PIT - DESER - DUSK

          The sun is sinking, turning the dunes a brilliant orange.

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          Security works a console in the Security Room. Their
          infrared monitors show a HERDSMAN AND HIS CAMELS walking
          across the desert dunes. A Technician taps some keys and an
          X-RAY IMAGE shows the skeletal structures of the herdsman and
          his camels.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          EXT. THE PIT - DESERT - NIGHT

          The HERDSMAN walks across the desert with his CAMELS under a
          FULL MOON and a field of glittering stars. All of a sudden,
          MULTIPLE MOUNDS OF SAND whip past his feet, almost knocking
          him over. He stares at them as they abruptly disappear
          deeper under the sand, like diving submarines.

          INT. MOLE POD - UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

          Ana drives the lead MOLE POD, an oblong-shaped digging device
          that is just large enough for her to fit inside. She watches
          her HUD relay information about her angle of decent and her
          distance to the target. Thirty yards...twenty yards...ten...

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

          A light flashes on the console in the security room.

          SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1
          Sensors detecting seismic activity
          to the southwest. Probably just a
          tremor, but have a team check it.

          INT. TRAINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Ripcord and the other Joes watch as Duke and Snake-Eyes
          circle one another with special ELECTRIFIED PUGIL STICKS.
          Duke thrusts with a standard bayonet style move, Snake-Eyes
          side steps it, spins his pugil stick above his head and
          brings it down on Duke's head with a sword-like stroke. A
          CRACKLING SHOCK is delivered and Duke goes down. The Joes
          grimace, feeling Duke's pain. Snake-Eyes turns away, done
          with him. Duke pops back up again.

          DUKE
          Again.
          They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified
          pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins and attempts
          a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move. Snake-Eyes
          blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down
          hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again,
          the Joes react. Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off
          and pops to his feet once more.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Again.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now. This
          time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the
          sweep. Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and
          STRIKES. Snake-Eyes barely blocks it. They trade half a
          dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before
          Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow. Duke stuffs it with his
          stick and tackles Snake-Eyes. They fall to the ground, both
          receiving JOLTS. They go eye-to-eye. It wasn't pretty, but
          Duke is getting effective. Snake-Eyes pops to his feet.
          This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up. Across the room,
          Hawk watches with approval.

          INT. THE PIT'S GENERATOR STATION - NIGHT

          The huge drill bit of Ana's mole machine bursts out of the
          reinforced clay wall, it opens and retracts, Ana rolls out
          and drops to the ground. Another huge drill bursts out, it
          retracts and opens and Storm Shadow drops to the ground.
          They look around. They're between the clay wall and the
          ELECTRIFIED POWER GRID FENCE of the Pit's generator station.

          ANA
          The foundation of this fence is a
          hundred feet deep. No going under.
          Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall.
          And then there's a crashing sound as one of the wall girders
          bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it.
          Ana can hear the engine grind to a halt.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          If we don't get him out he'll
          suffocate.
          Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like I care?

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Just thought I'd mention it.

          STORM SHADOW
          All that matters is the mission.
          Ana pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six
          STEEL BLUE BEAMS in a 360 DEGREE ARC, creating a DETAILED
          SCHEMATIC of the Pit, showing rooms and people moving about
          them. She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence.
          Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers. The Man
          immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity JOLTS
          him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts
          climbing the fence. The skin on his hands and arms starts to
          burn and bubble.

          

          

          

          

          48.

          STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)
          Acceptable collateral damage.

          ANA
          (trying to out-tough him)
          Is there any other?
          Near the top the Man finally falls backward and drops down
          dead. Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper. Without
          hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence. He is
          immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling.
          This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and
          crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the OFF
          SWITCH, cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself.
          Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence.

          INT. PIT BARRACKS - NIGHT

          An area where the Joe team chills. Duke and Ripcord enter,
          sore and worked over. They move to some couches. Heavy Duty
          grooves to the blasting Reggaeton classic "Salio El Sol".

          HEAVY DUTY
          You can learn a whole hell of a lot
          about a girl by the way she dances.
          Tell me I'm wrong Snake-Eyes.
          Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          See? He agrees.

          SCARLETT
          No, he doesn't. Do you?
          This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          See, he knows you have to listen to
          get to know someone. Right, Rip?
          Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over.

          RIPCORD
          What? You say something?
          Breaker sits at a chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him.

          BREAKER
          Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with
          Heavy D on this one.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          49.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          Like my man says, get a girl on the
          floor, you don't just see how she
          moves, you get the smell of her.
          What biologists tell us is that the
          decision is made by he nose long
          before the rest of the body gets
          involved. It's a question of
          pheromones.

          SCARLETT
          You're going to teach me science?
          I read all about the positron
          emission tomography studies
          concerning sex pheromones when I
          was twelve. I'm just saying, it's
          not very romantic.
          Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.

          RIPCORD
          Heavy told me she graduated college
          at twelve.
          No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          She's like a freaky genius. A
          deadly, freaky genius.

          DUKE
          You like her, I get it already.

          BREAKER
          (making a chess move)
          You can't learn this stuff in a
          book, Scarlett. You have to at
          least kiss a guy, before you're an
          expert on romance.
          The guys all laugh. Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow.

          SCARLETT
          Who am I shooting first?
          The laughter stops. Rip looks surprised.

          RIPCORD
          You haven't kissed anyone?
          Now Scarlett looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he
          could take his words back. Duke just shakes his head.

          

          

          

          

          50.

          DUKE
          Really firing on all cylinders
          there, Rip.

          HEAVY DUTY
          All I know is, when the bass get's
          that booty shaking in the right
          way, I'm in the skin like a man
          named Flynn.
          Heavy Duty does a little freak dance. Scarlett makes a show
          of disgust. Ripcord watches Scarlett, then makes a decision.

          RIPCORD
          Hell with it.
          He strides across the room toward Scarlett. Breaker notices.

          BREAKER
          (to no one in particular)
          Into the Valley of Death rode the

          600.
          Heavy Duty looks at him, confused. Breaker nods to Ripcord,
          stopping near Scarlett's chair. Ripcord sees Snake-Eyes
          taking in his every move. Scarlett now has her nose in a
          book. Ripcord CLEARS HIS THROAT but she doesn't look up. He
          peers closer and WE SEE THE COVER, on which, though in
          English, is a damn near INDECIPHERABLE SCIENTIFIC TITLE.

          RIPCORD
          Beach reading, huh?
          She groans and lowers the book only slightly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the
          wrong foot...
          Without changing expression she goes back to her book.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Okay look, I'm attracted to you.
          And you, you're attracted to me.
          And him--
          (nods towards Snake-Eyes)
          The Zen Master, he creeps me out,
          but what I'm saying is--

          SCARLETT
          "We're attracted to one another."

          

          

          

          

          51.

          RIPCORD
          Thank you.

          SCARLETT
          That's what you're saying, not what
          I'm saying.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, what are you saying?

          SCARLETT
          Attraction is an emotion. Emotions
          are not based in science. And if
          you can't quantify or prove that
          something exists, well, in my
          mind... it doesn't.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, I'll get back to you on that.
          And he walks away scratching his head. Hawk steps in.
          Everyone comes to attention.

          HAWK
          Duke, You scored in the top half-
          percent of all people we've ever
          tested. Rip, well, if we average
          your scores with Duke's, you pass
          too. Welcome aboard,
          provisionally. But we still need
          to see if you pass muster in the
          field.
          Hawk gives them a nod. Duke and rip nod back with pride.

          HEAVY DUTY
          YO JOE! Welcome aboard, boyz!

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Ana, Storm Shadow and the Neo-Vipers creep down the hallway.
          Two GI JOE GUARDS come around a corner, before they can even
          react, Storm Shadow practically cuts them in two with his
          Katana sword. Ana Directs them down another hallway.

          INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

          A DOOR reads, "General Hawk". Cover Girl walks up and
          knocks. As she waits, we see a SHADOW moving behind her.
          Hawk opens the door. She hands him her POWERBOOK and a

          STYLUS.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          COVER GIRL
          Sorry to disturb you, general.

          HAWK
          That's all right, Cover Girl. What
          am I signing now?
          Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her
          chest. She drops lifelessly, revealing Storm Shadow behind
          her. Hawk grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two
          swords. One slices the barrel of the pistol clean off, the
          other buries itself in Hawk's gut. Hawk collapses. Ana
          steps forward and rips the General's SECURITY BADGE off his
          jacket. Hawk's eyes follow them as they leave. He glances
          at a RED BUTTON under his desk and struggles to reach it,
          giving everything he's got, until he finally hits the button.

          INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

          A KLAXON BLARES. Duke, Ripcord and all the Joes leap up.

          DUKE
          The warheads.
          They all rush out of the doors. Breaker stops to change a
          chess piece on the board before racing out.

          INT. MAIN VAULT - NIGHT

          Ana swipes Hawk's SECURITY BADGE across the lock of the VAULT
          DOOR. It opens.
          The weapons case sits on a table. She opens the case to
          check that the four warheads are inside, they shine on her
          glasses.

          INT. MAIN VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

          Duke and Ripcord reach the main vault, armed only with their
          pistols. They find the INNER VAULT DOOR ajar. They
          approach, pushing back the door to discover that the place is
          empty and the weapons case is gone.

          DUKE
          They can't be far.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          INT. URBAN AREA - NIGHT

          Some of the Neo-Vipers now reach the MOLE PODS and begin
          prepping them for escape. BOOM! A GRENADE slams into them,
          killing them and destroying the pods. It's Heavy Duty with
          his "MPL". Ana enters the room and quick-draws her PULSE
          PISTOL and blasts away. Heavy Duty dives behind cover, which
          is blown away, knocking him out cold.
          Storm Shadow examines the ruined MOLE PODS, glancing around,
          his eyes falling on a pair of "ARCLIGHT" JET PACKS mounted on
          a wall rack nearby. Storm Shadow strides to the nearest one
          and puts it on. Ana heads after him, still carrying the
          case. Suddenly, Duke and Ripcord rush up behind them, guns
          raised.

          DUKE
          Put the case down, Ana,
          Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow.

          RIPCORD
          And you get out of that...thing.
          Stalemate. Storm Shadow doesn't move. Ana turns and looks
          at Duke. Sets the case down, her voice is gentle.

          ANA
          Fine. Done.
          Then she takes a step toward Duke.

          DUKE
          Stop, Ana. Stop right there.
          But she doesn't. She just keeps slowly moving toward him.

          ANA
          You can't shoot me, can you?

          DUKE
          I will if I have to.

          ANA
          Deep down, you're still the same
          man I fell in love with.

          DUKE
          Don't force this, Ana.

          

          

          

          

          54.

          ANA
          What could have been, right, Duke?
          You beside your best man. Me
          walking down the aisle.

          RIPCORD
          Don't listen to her, Duke.
          (a thought)
          Was I really going to be your best
          man?

          DUKE
          (cocking the pistol)
          Don't make me do this god-damnit!

          ANA
          "Don't make me do this?" A
          recurring theme in your life, right
          Duke?
          She takes another step. Duke levels his pistol right at her
          forehead. Storm Shadow flinches. Duke gives him a glance.

          DUKE
          Move and I'll blow her away.
          (to Ripcord)
          Get the briefcase.
          Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the
          trigger. Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves
          slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase. Ana is now an inch
          from the extended barrel. Ana and Duke are close enough to
          feel each other's breath. Their eyes lock.

          ANA
          Do it, Duke. .You already killed
          me once.
          And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit. Ripcord
          passes Ana, and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at
          Duke's pistol. AN ERRANT SHOT GOES OFF. Storm Shadow lunges
          at ripcord, SLICING his pistol in half with one sword and
          about to kill him with the other.
          When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME. CLANG! Snake-
          Eyes' KATANA BLADE saves Ripcord's life by a half inch.
          The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and immediately open fire,
          pinning both Duke and Ripcord down. All hell breaks loose.
          Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords
          flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords. Face-
          to-face, staring hard into each other's eyes.

          

          

          

          

          55.
          Snake-Eyes glances at Storm Shadow's right forearm, spotting
          the same RED MARKINGS of his ninja clan underneath his suit
          sleeve. This shocks the hell out of Snake-Eyes. Storm
          Shadow smiles.

          STORM SHADOW

          (CYNICAL)
          Hello brother.
          Snake-Eyes looks shocked. Storm Shadow uses the moment to
          elbow him in the face, knocking him hard to the ground. Ana
          grabs the weapons case as Scarlett rushes in, aiming her

          CROSSBOW PISTOL.

          SCARLETT
          I believe you've got my luggage.
          Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her
          shot tears the CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett's hands.
          Ana's got her dead-to-rights until Scarlett triggers her CAMO-
          SUIT, melting into nothing right in front of Ana.
          Ana doesn't spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she's
          stuck hard. The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her
          pistol is knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but
          that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped.
          Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but
          Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her.
          Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow
          climbs back into the Arclight. Looking at ana as she falls
          near a vehicle on the blocks. Ana grabs an OIL PAN and
          flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including
          Scarlett, making her visible. Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks
          her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of
          her.
          Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air,
          powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine
          pack. He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana
          by her arm, pulling her along. Ana grabs the weapons case
          and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing
          pad. The battle raging below them.
          Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the
          next level. Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the
          last of the Neo-Vipers. Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett who's
          nursing her neck.

          INT. ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          Ana climbs to Storm Shadow as the rocket up to the SECURITY
          ROOM WINDOW and BLAST it out of their way. SHATTER CITY.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          They fly into the security room and quickly dispatch the few
          technicians still alive. Ana his the large switch on the
          console and the huge door begins to spiral open. She jumps
          back into Storm Shadow's arms and they blast back out--

          EXT. ENTRANCE - THE PIT - NIGHT

          --and fly up through the hole where their Typhoon gunship
          rockets up. They fly in through a door as four Joe ANTI-
          AIRCRAFT TURRETS spring out of the sand, firing away at the
          Typhoon as it speeds away into the dark desert night...

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN

          Dawn light shimmers across the reflecting pool, the Lincoln
          Memorial, the Washington Monument.

          SUPER: WASHINGTON D.C.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAWN

          The AMERICAN PRESIDENT quickly but quietly closes the door to
          his bedroom, throwing on a robe, he charges down a corridor,
          trailed by his STAFF and BODYGUARDS. One of the staffers
          hands the President a report which he skims through.

          PRESIDENT
          How many warheads?

          STAFFER #1
          Four, Mr. President.

          PRESIDENT
          Any threats? Any demands?

          STAFFER #1
          None so far, sir.

          STAFFER #2
          We take this to mean the terrorists
          are unfocused, no clear goals.
          The President stops, glancing gravely back at his staff.

          PRESIDENT
          No, .it means they're going to
          use them.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          In the shadowy operating chamber, the Doctor approaches
          Zartan who sits on a gurney, scanning his PDA. Dozens of
          SMART ROBOTS warm up as the Doctor flicks on switches.

          THE DOCTOR
          Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?

          ZARTAN
          This is going to be the achievement
          of a lifetime.

          THE DOCTOR
          For you and me both.

          ZARTAN
          Eighteen months of studying the
          subject, learning the mannerisms,
          adopting his eating habits, losing
          sixty percent of my muscle mas...

          THE DOCTOR
          Your commitment has been inspiring.
          McCullen enters.

          MCCULLEN
          Gentlemen. About to get under way?
          Zartan raises his PDA.

          ZARTAN
          Once the ledgers are all square.

          MCCULLEN
          Check your account.
          Zartan checks the PDA. McCullen shakes his head.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          It's always about the money.

          ZARTAN
          It's a useful tool. You should
          understand that. Ah! The transfer
          just hit my account.
          Zartan puts the PDA aside, leans back on the gurney and

          CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES.

          

          

          

          

          59.

          ZARTAN (CONT'D)
          Let's do this.
          The Doctor straps Zartan down, then starts the SMART ROBOTS
          which converge on Zartan, injecting his body with dozens of
          long needles. He remains conscious, not feeling any pain.
          WE ZOOM into a LARGE NEEDLE which OPENS an INCISION behind
          his right ear. The needle feeds thousands of tiny NANO-MITES
          into Zartan's head. Zartan's eyes bulge, he starts to SCREAM
          and fight his restraints as the nano-mites begin to reshape
          his appearance, reforming facial bones and changing the
          texture and elasticity of his skin and even changing the
          color of his eyes. The Doctor grins proudly. McCullen looks
          disturbed.

          INT. URBAN AREA - THE PIT - DAY

          Joes are busy cleaning up the mess. Snake-Eyes sits by
          himself, hasn't moved in several hours. A thousand yard
          stare in his eyes. AND WE FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. A DRIZZLING SAIGON ALLEY - NIGHT

          A TEN YEAR OLD FRENCH ORPHAN BOY, cold from the rain and
          desperately hungry, scavenges for food in a garbage can, he
          looks up and notices a warm light coming from the other side
          of a wall and gate MARKED WITH RED CLAN MARKINGS.
          INSIDE THE TEMPLE: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in through the
          Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter. As he
          takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED
          CLAN MARKINGS on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow,
          healthy, wealthy, and well fed.

          YOUNG STORM SHADOW
          Thief !
          He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake-
          Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot. They fight
          fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and
          furniture. Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm
          Shadow's classic training gives him the edge. He finally
          traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his
          face. He starts to choke Snake-Eyes with his foot ...

          HARD MASTER (O.S.)
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Enough! Storm Shadow!
          A Ninja Master steps forward. Storm Shadow turns to him.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          YOUNG STORM SHADOW
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Father, he was stealing. We need to
          call the magistrate.

          HARD MASTER
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          He is hungry. We need to invite him
          in and show him the way.

          STORM SHADOW
          He's a cur! A Frenchie!

          HARD MASTER
          He doesn't fight like one.
          The two young warriors glare at one another.

          HARD MASTER (CONT'D)
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Now what shall be your clan name?
          Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes
          furiously. Hard Master just smiles, AHl
          AND WE FLASH BACK TO: Snake-Eyes in the motor pool, he stands
          up and walk off...

          INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

          Battered and bruised, Scarlett hurriedly enters the barracks.
          Checks around to see that she's alone. Then she heads for a
          mirror over one of the sinks, peeling back her collar to
          check the CHOKE MARKS on her neck. Her hands are trembling.
          She turns on the water and cleans her face with a WASH CLOTH.
          Ripcord enters the barracks behind. Like Scarlett, he looks
          around to see if he's alone. He catches Scarlett looking at
          him in the mirror, as if he's unwanted. Then he notices the
          choke marks. He is genuinely concerned.

          RIPCORD
          Jesus, you okay?

          SCARLETT
          I'm fine.

          RIPCORD
          You're not fine, let me look at
          that.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          SCARLETT
          I looked at it, it's fine.

          RIPCORD
          Take it easy, just trying to help.

          SCARLETT
          I know what you're trying to do.

          RIPCORD
          And what is that exactly?

          SCARLETT
          I don't have time for this.

          RIPCORD
          You know, not every guy you meet is
          an asshole. You do know that, don't
          you?
          Scarlett stops and returns to the sink, he ignores her,
          cleaning the blood off his face. She softens.

          SCARLETT
          It's not you, I... I didn't really
          want anyone to... see me in here.

          RIPCORD
          Why not?

          SCARLETT
          I don't know. All the people we
          lost last night. General Hawk... My
          neck is not that important.

          RIPCORD
          You almost died. You're allowed to
          be concerned.

          SCARLETT
          First fight I've lost since I was a
          kid. My father would be... he was
          my instructor.

          RIPCORD
          Think he's be disappointed.

          SCARLETT
          He taught me to win.

          RIPCORD
          I don't know how you teach anybody
          to win at everything every time.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          62.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          But I do know you can teach someone
          to get up when they get knocked
          down.
          Ripcord turn her gently in the mirror.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Look at you. Still here. Maybe this
          is what he wanted you to learn.
          Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          But of course, that would be an
          emotional response, one that can't
          be explained or quantified.
          Ripcord turns and heads for the door. Scarlett watches him.

          SCARLETT
          We're not a couple. Snake-Eyes and
          me. We're... close, he's like a
          brother, but... we're not a couple.
          Ripcord looks back at her, nods, then walks on out.

          INT. MEDICAL RECOVERY WING - DAY

          Hawk is hooked up to a LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE. Duke sits
          nearby, his shoulder being bandaged by a Medical Officer. WE
          PUSH IN ON Duke's eyes, staring into oblivion, AND FLASHBACK

          CUT TO: HAWK'S FACE RIGHT AT CAMERA:

          HAWK
          Can you kill her?
          And then WE FLASHBACK TO: Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on
          her face. Squeezing harder, harder. Pure evil.

          DOCTOR (V.0.)

          (PRELAP)
          That ought to hold you.

          INT. MEDICAL WING - DAY

          Duke "comes to" as the Doctor finishes and walks away. Duke
          takes a breath, looks to Hawk in his bed, then stands and
          walks over. He stares down at Hawk, then, a promise--

          DUKE
          Graveyard dead.

          

          

          

          

          63.

          INT. MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Duke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Heavy Duty stare at
          some next-gen computerized ultra-sound PHOTOSTATS of a dead
          Neo-Viper. Snake-Eyes points in question to an area.

          SCARLETT
          Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on
          the theory behind them at Oxford.
          They've been surgically implanted
          behind the ear, all programmed to
          accomplish different tasks.

          DUKE
          Like what?

          SCARLETT
          Theoretically, the possibilities
          are endless. Increase their speed,
          agility, resilience. You program,
          they perform. That's the genius of
          nanotechnology, it can do pretty
          much whatever you want it to.

          DUKE
          Mind control?

          SCARLETT
          I don't see why not.

          INT. CORRIDOR - THE PIT - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord move with the others through a corridor.

          DUKE
          Their weaponry, financing, intel,
          it has to be McCullen. Doing an
          inside job on his own warheads.

          SCARLETT
          You may be right. Maybe he needed
          NATO to pay for his R D.

          RIPCORD
          The weapons case!
          Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Remember he had us open the case
          for him. Remember that?

          

          

          

          

          64.

          SCARLETT
          What about it?

          RIPCORD
          I'll bet that code he gave us like
          re-activated the tracking beacon or
          something.
          Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense.

          DUKE
          And who says you're not a thinker.
          All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath.

          BREAKER
          I think I found her...

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Breaker leads the group into the control room where a WEDDING
          PHOTO OF ANA AND DeCobray is up on screen. Duke stares at the
          photo, gazing at her face. Ripcord sees her and knows, too.

          DUKE
          Yeah, you found her all right.

          BREAKER
          Her name is Ana DeCobray now,
          Baroness if you're feeling formal.

          RIPCORD
          Wow, she traded up, huh?
          (off Duke's look)
          I mean... financially.

          DUKE
          Who is he?

          BREAKER
          Baron DeCobray. Big shot French
          scientist. Runs a lab in Paris.

          SCARLETT
          Lab?
          Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a
          huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other scientists.

          BREAKER
          Particle accelerator.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          SCARLETT
          They're gonna use him to weaponize
          the warheads.

          DUKE
          That's where she's going.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Who likes croissants?

          EXT. BLACK SKY - NIGHT

          And then a lighted aircraft in the distance approaches at
          Mach three. It's the Howler.

          INT. THE HOWLER - NIGHT

          The Joes are silent, eyes ahead. Scarlett shares a smile with
          Ripcord, next to her, Across from them Duke watches, almost
          smiles, then lays back his head and closes his eyes. AND WE

          FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - DAY

          CAMERA PANS AROUND a village choked by thick jungle as
          EXPLOSIONS erupt in SLO-MO and a BLACKHAWK circles, ROTORS
          beating hypnotically, giving the images a dreamlike quality.

          INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER, DAWN - FLASHBACK

          Duke, Ripcord, Rex, and the rest of an insertion team, sit
          with their backs against the chopper walls.

          DUKE
          Per the briefing, we fast rope in,
          form up and assault the main lab...
          (a glance at Rex)
          Rex--uh, .the science officer,
          stays back with Fireteam Alpha
          until Bravo enters and secures the
          building. Alpha holds the perimeter
          while science officer secures the
          WMDs. Five minutes before
          extraction and the airstrike.
          The squad nods.
          Duke looks to Rex again. Rex is sweating, trying not to show
          it. Duke hands him a piece of gum.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Double Bubble?
          Rex takes it. Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Always helps me. You good?

          REX
          (weak smile back)
          Yeah...
          They chew their gum.

          EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - FLASHBACK - DAY

          DOWN IN THE VILLAGE: Duke leads a frontal assault of the main
          building. They take fire from some GUARDS, but put them down.
          Other GUARDS flee. The way to the door is cleared. Duke gives
          hand signals along with his commands.

          DUKE
          Go, Bravo.
          Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building. They
          disappear inside.
          Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his
          hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his
          shoulder. Duke scans the treeline for any treats.
          One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals "ALL
          CLEAR." Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          You're good to go, Rex. You don't
          find it in four minutes, get out of
          there, because that house won't be
          standing in five. I already called
          for the air strike.
          Rex nods. Duke gives him a smile. Rex takes off and runs low
          to the door, entering the house. Duke watches him go, then
          looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of mortars. Duke
          takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the
          mortar rounds start to hit.
          The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke,
          Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover.
          We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle,
          firing. Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          RIPCORD
          I've gotta level with ya!

          DUKE
          I hate it when you level with me.

          RIPCORD
          Gonna be a long five minutes.
          Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the
          distance, RUMBLING coming from the sonic roar of JETS.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          I love that sound...
          But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face.

          DUKE
          No, no, no... It's too soon.
          ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across
          the sky. Duke looks back at the main building.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Rex.
          Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire and mortar explosions
          all around him. Then the whistle of a bunker buster. Duke
          dives and BOOM! The building is flattened by the bomb. Duke
          is tossed through the air like a rag doll. Lands hard, barely
          registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles
          toward the smoking. Flaming rubble that was the building.
          The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the
          tracer fire and explosions intensify. Black smoke washes over
          Duke. Ripcord finds him in the debris.

          RIPCORD
          Blackhawk's waiting. Come on, we've
          got wounded! And incoming enemy!
          Lots of 'em!

          DUKE
          I can't.

          RIPCORD
          Nothing you can do. Come on...!
          Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from
          the ruins of the house.

          

          

          

          

          68.

          INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER - FLASHBACK

          TIGHT ON Duke's haunted, soot-streaked face as his eyes take
          on a thousand-yard stare. AND WE CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:

          INT. HOWLER - NIGHT

          Duke is wide awake, his eyes have on a thousand-yard stare...

          EXT. PARIS - FRANCE - DAY

          Paris by day, the Eiffel Tower in all her glory.

          EXT. GUARD SHED - LABORATORY - DAY

          Ana's SCARAB ATTACK TRUCK pulls up to a GUARD SHED outside a
          large building which is surrounded by an ELECTRIFIED FENCE. A
          SECURITY GUARD steps out of the shed and taps on the driver's
          window. The Neo-Viper behind the wheel lowers the BACKSEAT
          WINDOW, revealing Ana and Storm Shadow in the back. The guard
          smiles at Ana. They speak in French, subtitled.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Good Morning. Baroness.

          ANA
          Good morning. Gene. My husband's
          expecting me.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Absolument.
          The Security Guard opens the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab
          drives up to the building.

          INT. FOYER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Two SECURITY GUARDS look up from their desks as Ana and Storm
          Shadow stride through the DOORS with two Neo-Vipers. Storm
          Shadow throws something. Both guards fall dead. THROWING
          STARS in their heads. The Neo-Vipers steal behind the desk,
          throw a switch, open a LOCKED DOOR for Ana and Storm Shadow.

          INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Ana and Storm Shadow enter a colossal chamber which is all
          but consumed by the PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          LAB TECHNICIANS swarm all over it, taking readings and making
          adjustments, under the eyes of DeCobray who sits at a control
          station surrounded by monitors. Ana gives the weapons case to
          Storm Shadow who hangs back as she walks up to her husband.

          DECOBRAY
          Ana...?

          ANA
          I need you to do something for me
          and I don't have much time.

          DECOBRAY
          (sees Storm Shadow)
          Who is this?
          She beckons Storm Shadow who sets the weapons case down on
          DeCobray's desk, opening it up to reveal the four NANOTECH
          WARHEADS and their launchers. DeCobray stares, bewildered.

          DECOBRAY (CONT'D)
          I don't understand... what are these
          things? What's going on?

          ANA
          They're warheads, dear. And I need
          you to weaponize them for me...
          (looking around)
          .or we'll kill everyone in here.
          DeCobray stares at her, shocked. He looks at Storm Shadow who
          removes a GLOCK PISTOL from his belt and shoots a TECHNICIAN.
          Chaos erupts. DeCobray shouts to the room, calming the others
          somewhat. He stares at Ana and Storm Shadow, terrified.

          DECOBRAY
          This is a civilian laboratory. We
          don't have the correct programming
          protocols for weaponizing...

          ANA
          The protocols are in the case.
          (he hesitates)
          I told you, I don't have much time.
          DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case.

          EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          A BRAWLER charges through the streets. On the outside it
          looks like your Uncle's R.V, but inside it's all next-gen.

          

          

          

          

          70.

          INT. BRAWLER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Heavy Duty drives the Brawler while Breaker mans a hi-tech
          terminal next to him. In the back, Snake-Eyes loads his guns
          while Scarlett, Duke, and Ripcord put on ACCELERATOR SUITS.

          SCARLETT
          Heavy D and Breaker will stay in
          the Brawler, watch our back. The
          rest of us will break into the lab
          with the accelerator suits. Once
          the warheads are weaponized,
          they'll be extremely volatile. We
          can't afford to let any of them go
          off inside the city.
          Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes.

          RIPCORD
          What about you? Don't you get a
          suit?
          Snake-Eyes just looks at him, "Are you kidding me?"

          SCARLETT
          He doesn't need one.

          INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY

          A TREMENDOUS WHINE echoes through the chamber as the particle
          accelerator come to life, HUMMING evenly. Storm Shadow backs
          up a little. Ana glances at him. He shrugs, what? Technicians
          quickly finish up and back away from the accelerator.

          DECOBRAY
          Firing.
          DeCobray hits a switch. The PARTICLE ACCELERATOR charges and
          begins hurling atoms through miles and miles of underground
          tunnels. Inside the accelerator, the four warheads begin to
          spin in a GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER -- then, as the power grows,
          they begin to rise, each one hovering as they spin.
          Ana and Storm Shadow watch with mild curiosity as the noise
          inside the chamber builds. The atoms catapulting faster and
          faster through the tunnels, bombarding the warheads again and
          again. Until finally, a LOUD BOOM rings out. And the warheads
          slowly sink back down and stop spinning.
          DeCobray keys another button and the GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER
          emerges from the accelerator.

          

          

          

          

          71.
          Technicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the
          warheads, returning them to their case. Storm Shadow locks
          the case and picks it up.

          DECOBRAY (CONT'D)
          Careful... they're alive.

          ANA
          Thank you, Leon.

          DECOBRAY
          I think I have never seen the face
          of evil until I looked at you now.
          Ana looks at him and falters, something in his words piercing
          her hard veneer. She feels Storm Shadow watching her and
          with a flick of her eyes, the walls go up again. She drop a
          SEALED ENVELOPE on DeCobray's desk and heads for the door.

          ANA
          Adieu.
          DeCobray watches her go, then opens the envelope. We see the
          LARGE HEADER printed on the first page: "ACCORD DE DIVORCE".

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - LABORATORY - DAY

          The Brawler races up towards the lab, they see it out their
          forward windows.

          HEAVY DUTY
          There it is.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - DAY

          Ana and Storm Shadow emerge from the lab and climb into the
          back of the Scarab as the two Neo-Vipers climb in the front.

          INT. FOYER - DAY

          DeCobray stumbles out to the foyer, finds the two Security
          Guards dead, and quickly picks up a phone.

          EXT. GUARD SHED - DAY

          The Security Guard in the guard shed puts down his phone and
          glances at the oncoming Scarab just as a Neo-Viper leans out
          with his PULSE RIFLE and blasts the whole shed to pieces.
          The Scarab crashes right out the gate.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER/SCARAB - DAY

          At the same time, the Brawler reaches the laboratory and
          there's a split second where both sides see each other in
          their windows. Duke and Ana lock eyes. Snake-Eyes and Storm
          Shadow do the same.

          BREAKER
          That's them!
          Snake-Eyes is already moving, lunging out a SIDE DOOR onto
          the street as the Brawler still moves, running right at the
          Scarab which turns to get away. Scarlett immediately follows
          him out, landing in a roll with her accelerator suit.
          Ana leans out of her window and fires her PULSE PISTOLS at
          the Brawler, keeping Duke and Rip inside. Then she fires at
          Snake-Eyes and Scarlett. Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts
          nail Scarlett. She crashes hard. Snake-Eyes glances at her.

          SCARLETT
          Keep going!
          With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back
          of the vehicle as it tears away. The Brawler stops right
          next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator suit

          FRITZING.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          (to Duke and Ripcord)
          Don't worry about me, go and help
          Snake-Eyes!
          Duke doesn't need to be told twice. He leaps out and runs
          after the Scarab. Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him.

          BREAKER
          Careful. They're worth millions of
          dollars... each.

          RIPCORD
          Millions of dollars, got it.
          He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement. Picks himself
          up. Gets hit by a car. Picks himself up again.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          (to Driver)
          Sorry! Excusem moil
          (to a stunned Breaker)
          Won't happen again.

          

          

          

          

          73.
          Then Rip hauls-ass after Duke.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          An ACCORDIAN BUS passes casually through an intersection.
          All of a sudden, the Scarab bursts through it, ripping it in
          two and barrelling on down the busy street. Snake-Eyes is
          still barely clinging to the back.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Breaker watches the two halves of the bus whirl around on his
          SATELLITE VIEW as Heavy Duty drives through the city streets.

          BREAKER
          Christ, they just shot right
          through a bus!

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

           Duke and Rip charge after the Scarab. Their speedometers
          reading 15mph...then 30mph...then 40mph. they leap over and
          around speeding cars and trucks.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          The Scarab smashes through any vehicle in its path, leaving a
          trail of destruction for Duke and Ripcord to leap over or
          dart around in their suits. Ana and Storm Shadow hear Snake-
          Eyes on the roof and drop their windows and lean out and
          shoot at him. But Snake-Eyes quickly clambers down the side
          of the vehicle, escaping their shots by disappearing beneath
          the undercarriage.
          And that's when Ana sees Duke and Rip following. She sits
          back down inside and keys a button on a console.
          SIDE PANELS slide open on the outside of the Scarab to reveal
          two MISSILES, one on each side. They fire.
          The MISSILES streak back towards Duke and Ripcord. No time
          to get out of the way, they dive and roll in various
          directions, extreme kinetic energy hurling them forward. The
          two missiles whip between them and detonate, one on a PARKING
          OFFICER'S CAR and the other on a BILLBOARD. The EXPLOSION
          from the car knocks them down. The Scarab tears away around
          a corner.

          

          

          

          

          74.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          They see Snake-Eyes on their monitors in the Brawler.

          BREAKER
          They're turning the corner. Go
          through that building at 6 o'clock!

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord see the building in front of them.

          RIPCORD
          There's no door!

          BREAKER'S VOICE
          Make one!
          Duke charges directly at the building. Ripcord reluctantly
          following as Duke smashes through the wall into...

          INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PARIS - DAY

          A crowded bar. Neither of them slow for a second. Duke
          bolts through. Rip grabs a MARTINI, opens his visor, downs
          the drink, then places the empty glass on the tray of a
          stunned waitress. Behind her a sign reads: "DRINK
          RESPONSIBLY". Duke and Ripcord SMASH through the opposite
          wall...

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

          .back out onto the city streets where they turn and level
          their WRIST-MOUNTED ROCKETS at...nothing. A puzzling beat.
          And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed.
          Ripcord dives out of the way just in time. Duke has no such
          luck. He spins and catches the FRONT GRILL, digging his feet
          into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down. But the
          Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to
          crush DUKE in the criss-crossing traffic.
          Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an SUV CRASHES into
          the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage.
          Duke tumbles up onto the roof. A PULSE CANNON pops up. Duke
          dives off the back as the weapon fires. He tumbles to the
          pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his WRIST-
          MOUNTED ROCKETS at the Scarab. Duke fires with him.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Their rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the PULSE CANNON.
          BOOM! But its armor saves the vehicle.
          INSIDE: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around. Storm
          Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own ACCELERATOR
          SUITS. Hands it to Ana.

          STORM SHADOW
          Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy
          if I let you die.
          Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in.

          ANA
          How thoughtful.

          INT. BRAWLER - DAY

          On the monitors, Scarlett and Breaker watch the Scarab via
          Snake-Eyes speeding through the streets.

          SCARLETT
          Look at the moves they're making,
          they're heading somewhere.
          Breaker widens the map, plotting a route.

          BREAKER
          This's their route from the lab.
          On the screen, they see the lab, the current position of the
          Scarab, and what lies just ahead. . .the Eiffel Tower.

          SCARLETT

          (REALIZING)
          Metal... Oh God...

          EXT. SCARAB/STREETS - DAY

          Snake-Eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage.
          Duke and Rip are catching up behind him.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Guys, you have to stop them.

          DUKE
          Yeah, we're working on it.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          I mean right now. They're going to
          detonate one of the warheads on the
          Eiffel Tower.
          Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast.

          RIPCORD
          Oh, man...
          Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and
          fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which
          promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the
          vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks.
          Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes
          into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the
          Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe.
          Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke manages
          to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of
          the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and
          PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train...

          INT. METRO-RAIL TRAIN - DAY

          .flying across the aisle, whipping past a group of stunned
          morning COMMUTERS, and smashing out through the far window...

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          The Scarab, Duke and Rip all CRASH HARD to the pavement and
          tumble. Sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere. Duke
          and Rip finally stop tumbling, a hundred yards away from the
          wreck of the Scarab.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Scarlett, Heavy Duty and Breaker see this on their monitors.

          HEAVY DUTY/BREAKER
          Holy shit...

          SCARLETT

          (CRINGING)
          You guys okay?

          EXT. RAILWAY CROSSING - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged.

          

          

          

          

          77.

          DUKE
          What happened to you?

          RIPCORD
          I went through the train. What
          happened to you?

          DUKE
          I jumped over it.

          RIPCORD
          You can do that?

          DUKE
          Yeah, you didn't know?
          INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead. Storm
          Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in
          her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons
          case and he and Ana leap out.
          Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls
          out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana
          emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          C'mon!
          Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.

          EXT. EIFFEL TOWER - DAY

          HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower
          to buy their tickets and start their tours. Storm Shadow and
          Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they
          bound onto the stairs. People scream at the sight of Ana.
          Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their
          Accelerator Suits like beings from another world. They spot
          Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them. The
          Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke
          and Ripcord. The BULLETS ping off their suits.

          RIPCORD
          (to Duke)
          How do you say "we're the good
          guys" in French?
          Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up
          under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.

          

          

          

          

          78.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs
          and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the
          opposite side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a
          gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the
          man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing
          a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs--
          --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The
          avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the
          stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without
          a safety net. He makes it to the first floor and races after
          Ana and Storm Shadow.
          ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first
          out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them
          carrying weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the
          defensive as they hurry up to the stairway. Guns go up.
          Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French.

          SCARLETT
          (French, subtitled)
          Don't shoot! We're a special anti-
          terrorist unit! There's a bomb up
          there!
          POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them.
          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the
          main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow
          hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case
          and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH.
          Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top
          of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him
          while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's
          pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at
          Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the
          warhead.
          A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils.
          ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze.
          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in
          all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and
          hits a button for the top. The elevator races upwards as
          everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The
          floor begins to disappear. Tourists stampede towards the
          stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP. The
          mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the
          railing.

          

          

          

          

          79.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her
          coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in
          time. Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes.
          Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the
          tourists. He leaps up onto the iron lattice.

          RIPCORD
          Where you going?

          DUKE
          Each warhead has a kill switch.

          RIPCORD
          It's too late! We gotta get off
          this thing!

          DUKE
          Those nano-mites will level the
          entire city!
          Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator
          Suit. Rip things about following, but then looks at the
          little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes
          grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs.
          The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them,
          Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police
          evacuate the Tower.
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.

          ANA
          (into mike)
          Be ready to pick up in thirty
          seconds.
          IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of
          the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening.
          ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing
          him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck
          just above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION
          CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower. He falls, but
          manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost
          on top of him now. The climbs even faster.
          ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm Shadow
          calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers
          up beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower
          groans and wobbles. It's a long way down. Time has run out.
          Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon.

          

          

          

          

          80.
          With the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps
          up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and
          latching onto the SIDE DOOR of the Typhoon.
          IN THE TYPHOON: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight.
          Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing. Duke springs
          inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL
          SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger.
          Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the
          ground around the Eiffel Tower.
          The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side.
          Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes
          down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of
          water. The shock on the faces of everyone around
          reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his
          eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets
          an idea.

          BREAKER
          Come on!
          He hauls-ass.

          INT. TYPHOON - DAY

          Ana looks at Duke, a pursed smile on her lips.

          ANA
          You just saved Paris.
          Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops
          hard to the floor of the Typhoon.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          A crowd has gathered around the crashed Scarab. Heavy Duty
          yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out. Breaker yanks off the
          guy's HELMET then removes a needle-like PORT PLUG from his
          SURVEILLANCE SUIT. Scarlett moves into position to help him.
          Ripcord kneels down.

          RIPCORD
          What are you doing?

          BREAKER
          Plugging into his cerebral cortex.
          With a SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the
          top of the Neo-Viper's head. Ripcord winces at the sight.

          

          

          

          

          81.

          SCARLETT
          The brain survives for a couple of
          minutes after death. We can read
          his most recent memories.

          RIPCORD
          Can you find Duke?

          BREAKER
          If this guy remembers the way home
          we can.
          INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD.
          Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway,
          driving the ARMORED CAR. As the images continue, we PUSH IN
          on the Neo-Viper's open eyes and CUT TO:

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen watching Breaker and Ripcord through the dead Neo-
          Viper's eyes on a screen. He turns to the Doctor urgently.

          MCCULLEN
          Destroy that unit immediately.
          The Doctor removes his PDA and taps a key to draw up the Neo-
          Viper's file. He clicks a button that reads "TERMINATE".

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          Instantly, the Neo-Viper's body snaps rigid and begins to
          shake. Everyone gets a shock. Backing up.

          HEAVY DUTY
          He's still alive!

          SCARLETT
          He's not alive.

          HEAVY DUTY
          You ever seen a dead guy do that?

          SCARLETT
          They activated a self-destruct.
          The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them. Thousands
          of NANO-MITES literally eating away at his flesh and bones.

          BREAKER
          Nano-mites!

          They're eating him!

          SCARLETT
          Hurry, Breaker!
          But the NANO-MITES are too fast. The Neo-Viper's legs are
          now gone. His chest and arms next. Breaker rapidly scans
          through the MEMORY FLASHES. But now the NANO-MITES consume
          his head.

          BREAKER

          McCullen watches Breaker's frantic face suddenly disappear on
          his screen. He gives the Doctor a smile.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Breaker looks crestfallen at the empty Neo-Viper suit in his
          arms. Ripcord kneels beside him, stunned and bereft.

          RIPCORD
          You did the best you could.

          BREAKER
          Relax, I got it.

          Well, what was the "NOO!" for?

          BREAKER
          That was for McCullen.
          There is the sound of weapons being raised. The team looks
          to see they are surrounded by FRENCH POLICE and PARATROOPERS.

          We're not doing Duke a damned bit
          of good sitting here. If it was
          reversed, Duke would be kicking

          RIP'S DOG TAGS hit the floor and slide to his feet. The Joes
          all look up to see several POLICE OFFICIALS looking at them.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          The Joes are led down a hallway.

          RIPCORD
          They did away with the guillotine,
          right?
          They arrive at a door. The door is opened to reveal a man in
          a wheelchair, back turned. When he spins around, it's Hawk.

          BREAKER
          General!
          Hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily.

          INT. ROOM - LATER

          The Joes sit around the General, mid-discussion.

          HEAVY DUTY
          How long before we're released?

          HAWK
          The French government is allowing
          you to leave on the condition that
          none of you ever return. Other
          agencies will be handling this from
          here on.

          SCARLETT/RIPCORD
          What?!

          HAWK
          The heads of state of every member
          of GI JOE are recalling their
          operatives. We are now considered
          a rogue unit, uncontrollable. Shut
          down. We're to report to
          Washington for debriefing.
          Hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door.

          RIPCORD
          That's it? They've got Duke!

          

          

          

          

          86.
          Hawk stops his wheelchair, turns to them.

          HAWK
          I said you were to report to
          Washington. I didn't say when, or
          which route to take.

          SCARLETT
          Maybe a northern one.
          Hawk smiles and wheels out the door.

          EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DUSK

          A NIGHT RAVEN rockets through the orange skies, SMASHING
          through the sound barrier with an ear-tingling SONIC BOOM.

          INT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DUSK

          Storm Shadow sits in a meditative state. Duke is shackled,
          hands bound, out of his ACCELERATOR SUIT. Ana steps out of
          the cockpit area and approaches him, nods to Storm Shadow.

          ANA
          He thinks I should kill you.

          DUKE
          Why don't you?

          ANA
          James wants to meet you in person.

          DUKE
          James?

          ANA
          Mr McCullen.

          DUKE
          Ana listen--

          ANA
          --Talk softly, or he'll tazer you
          again.

          DUKE
          (raises his bound hands)
          Loosen these, he'll never taser
          anything again.
          She taps the bonds on his wrists.

          

          

          

          

          87.

          ANA
          I should've thought of this before.
          They almost share a smile.

          DUKE
          Let me get this straight. You're
          with McCullen. You're married to
          that Baron. And you claim you're
          still in love with me.

          ANA
          I'm a complex woman.

          DUKE
          Maybe you just don't know who you
          are anymore.

          ANA
          Who I was died long ago.

          DUKE
          No, this isn't you, I still see the
          person I loved behind your eyes.
          Her eyes soften for a moment.

          ANA
          Tell me what she was like.

          DUKE
          She was smart, and funny. She was
          loyal as hell. She loved those she
          was close with, me, her brother...
          (agonized pause)
          I did my best. With Rex. I'm
          sorry. He was my responsibility.
          I should have... It's why I left,
          Ana. Why I couldn't be with you.
          You were in so much pain... I
          thought the sight of me just give
          you more.
          She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then... a
          hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she shakes her head.

          ANA
          It doesn't matter now.

          DUKE
          No, it matters very much. We have
          the chance to make things right.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          ANA
          Nothing will ever be right again.
          Duke stares at her, his heart ripped apart. WE PUSH IN ON
          the two of them and FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - WASHINGTON D.C. - FLASHBACK - DAY

          Rain is drizzling on a military cemetery. Ana sits alone,
          without family, without Duke, staring straight ahead as Rex's
          casket is lowered into the ground.
          Parked on a nearby road is a lone car. Duke sits inside it,
          staring at the funeral in the distance. His face tells us
          the anguish he's living with. He pulls out and starts to
          drive away, the rain on the windshield BLURS AS WE DISSOLVE

          TO:

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - POLAR ICE CAP - NIGHT

          The Night Raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge
          CAVE. A SET OF RUNWAY LIGHTS appear under the ice, guiding
          it in for a smooth landing. The cave swallows the plane
          whole.

          INT. ICE CAVE - NIGHT

          The Night Raven rolls to a stop inside the cave. The side
          door opens. Storm Shadow exits with the weapons case. Ana
          leads Duke out, two Neo-Vipers behind them. Storm Shadow
          clicks a hand held remote and a HIDDEN ICE WALL opens to
          reveal a HI-TECH DIVING BELL awaiting them. Duke uses the
          moment to lunge forward, grab the case and haul ass towards
          the cave door. Storm Shadow spins, Shurikan throwing stars
          in his hands. The Neo-Vipers whip up their pulse rifles.

          ANA
          NO! McCullen has plans for him!
          Storm Shadow throws a star, it whistles across the cave and
          nails Duke in his shoulder, Duke goes down hard, staggers
          back up, but the Neo-Vipers are already on him, they start
          beating the living shit out of him. Ana jogs up.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Enough!
          Storm Shadow picks up the case and looks at Duke, face down,
          bloody and beaten.

          

          

          

          

          89.

          STORM SHADOW
          And what was your plan? Run three
          thousand miles across the ice?
          He rips his star out of Duke's shoulder. Duke sucks it up.

          STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)
          Stupid soldier.
          Duke rolls over and stares up at them, breathing hard.

          INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

          Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, Heavy Duty and Breaker are in
          the conn tower of a next-gen submarine, going over a 3-D MAP
          of the polar ice cap.

          HEAVY DUTY
          That's a lotta ice.

          RIPCORD
          It's gonna be like trying to find
          whale spit in the ocean.
          Breaker sees a SMALL LIGHT flashing on his Ball-Eyepiece.

          BREAKER
          That's strange.

          SCARLETT
          What?

          BREAKER
          When they stole the weapons case, I
          set my suit to scan for the tracker
          beacon in case it came back on, and
          it just came back on.
          Ripcord just smiles.

          RIPCORD
          That's my boy.

          EXT. ARCTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

          The DIVING BELL comes shooting down out of a shaft in the
          bottom of the ice cap and rockets down towards the facility.

          

          

          

          

          90.

          INT. DIVING BELL - NIGHT

          As the diving bell descends, Duke stares at the facility out
          the portal. He is awed by the immense size of the place, he
          looks at Ana, proud of her office.

          ANA
          Certain work needs to be done away
          from the public eye.

          INT. ENTRY PORT - NIGHT

          The diving bell entry port opens, guarded by two Neo-Vipers.
          McCullen stands waiting. His eyes first move to the weapons
          case in Storm Shadow's hands. Storm Shadow opens it and
          shows him the three remaining warheads. McCullen runs his
          fingers over them, then nods, Storm Shadow closes the case.

          MCCULLEN
          Take them to the drones. I want
          them ready to launch in one hour.

          STORM SHADOW
          It will be done.
          And only then does McCullen greet Ana.

          MCCULLEN
          My beautiful Lady of the Lake...
          He kisses her. Ana kisses him back with slightly-feigned
          affection, her eyes open and on Duke. Duke stands there,
          impassive. McCullen finishes the kiss and turns to Duke.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          This bother you?
          Duke says nothing, so McCullen steps closer.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Isn't it funny, with the entire
          balance of power in the world about
          to shift, a couple of guys can
          still have a stare down over who
          gets the girl.
          Duke takes the opportunity to HEAD BUTT McCullen. The Neo-
          Vipers instantly pummel Duke to the floor. McCullen wipes a
          small trickle of blood from his nose.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          The interesting thing about my Neo-
          Vipers is they still think the same
          thoughts they always did, they just
          can't act on them anymore. Instead,
          they do what I want. I imagine that
          must be very frustrating.
          He gets right down in Duke's face.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          I'm going to make you very unhappy.

          DUKE
          (grit teeth)
          I'm already happy.
          McCullen glances at Ana, watching the display with conflicted
          eyes. McCullen heads for the door, beckoning the Neo-Vipers
          to make Duke follow him.

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          Duke trails behind McCullen and Ana, flanked by Neo-Vipers.

          DUKE
          What're you gonna do with the
          warheads?

          MCCULLEN
          You take to your training well,
          that's good. Still trying to
          develop information. Still planning
          to escape and stope me. Moments
          from now, you'll see that won't
          ever happen.

          DUKE
          Then you won't mind telling me.

          MCCULLEN
          Isn't it clear? I'm a business man.
          I'm going to use them.

          DUKE
          Millions of people are gonna die if
          you launch those warheads. What is
          it you want, McCullen?

          

          

          

          

          92.

          MCCULLEN
          Merely to strike fear into the
          hearts of every man, woman, and
          child on the planet. Only then will
          they look up to the man who wields
          the most power, and obey him.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The control room is alive with TECHNICIANS squirreling about
          various stations. Monitors show three large AERIAL DRONES
          sitting in vertical launch bays. Duke sees the drones and his
          face registers the horror of what McCullen's about to do. He
          glances at Ana, she quietly looks away, a hint of remorse in
          her eyes? The Doctor rises to greet McCullen, glancing at
          Duke for several moments, as if struck by the sight of him.

          MCCULLEN
          Meet the genius behind all my
          nanotechnology.

          THE DOCTOR
          My genius lies only in taking what
          others created to the logical next
          steps. All modern gains in science
          are made through theft.

          MCCULLEN
          You'll have to excuse his modesty,
          when I found him, he was --

          THE DOCTOR
          (interrupting, re: Duke)
          --Another "recruit"?

          MCCULLEN
          Albeit a rather unwilling one. The
          Doctor's nano-mites can control all
          manner of brain functions. When you
          wake up, you'll be working for me,
          and your past will be a distant
          shimmer that floats in and out of
          your mind like a leaf on a breeze.

          THE DOCTOR
          I'll prepare him for the surgery.
          The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him
          towards another door. Duke and Ana exchange one last look.
          McCullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          EXT. DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - UNDERWATER - DAY

          A school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks
          away from the school. CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT ON IT: it's not a
          fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system.

          EXT. SUBMARINE - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          A sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters.

          BREAKER (V.0.)
          Picture's coming on line now.

          INT. CONN TOWER - SUBMARINE - DAY

          In the Conn Tower of the sub, our team gathers around Breaker
          who sits at a monitor watching what the "fish" is watching.

          SCARLETT
          It's an underwater facility...

          HEAVY DUTY
          McCullen's home away from home.

          RIPCORD
          Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere.

          SCARLETT
          Wait, what's that?
          Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON.

          BREAKER
          Oh, Jesus...That's an automated,
          phased array turbo-pulse battery.
          (off their looks)
          A really big gun.

          SCARLETT
          Could it take out our sub?

          BREAKER
          That thing could take out a dozen
          subs simultaneously.

          SCARLETT
          Then that's our first objective.

          RIPCORD
          No, no. Duke's our first objective.

          

          

          

          

          94.

          SCARLETT
          The main force can't attack as long
          as that cannon's online.

          HEAVY DUTY
          How you figure getting it offline?
          Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor.

          SCARLETT
          Elevator cables. They've got a
          surface entrance. Shipwreck?
          She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR "SHIPWRECK"
          DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran.

          SHIPWRECK
          Going up, senorita?
          Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor.

          SCARLETT
          Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I
          will infiltrate the factory from
          above and destroy the cannon. Heavy
          D, as soon as we give the word, you
          lead the assault from outside.

          HEAVY DUTY
          (nods grimly)
          Go, Joes...

          EXT. ICE FIELD - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          A quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice. All
          of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of
          all earthquakes. It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as
          the CONN TOWER of the submarine crashes through, then grinds
          to a halt. A FORWARD HATCH OPENS and two ROCK SLIDES launch
          out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away. Ripcord and
          Breaker on one. Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other.

          INT. LAUNCH BAY- DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch monitors showing
          TECHNICIANS securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled
          SMART-DRONES. As the last one is secured a Technician says:

          TECHNICIAN
          All drones prepared and ready, Sir.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          MCCULLEN
          Good, commence the launch sequence
          immediately.
          is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face?

          INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          Our team races into the ice cave on their ROCK SLIDES and
          park beside the dormant Night Raven. Weapons up. Scanning the
          place from top to bottom. Ripcord stars at the awesome plane
          towering before him.

          RIPCORD
          That McCullen's got some gadgets.
          Breaker gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana
          sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out,
          revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES, but no diving bell.

          BREAKER
          Maybe we could slide down.
          Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful

          SCARLETT
          The arctic water would kill us.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch the drones sitting in
          the launch bays on the screens. Technicians are working hard.

          TECHNICIAN
          Three... two... one... ignite primary
          engines.
          The entire control room begins to shake. The screens fill
          with fire.

          INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          The Joes run outside, wondering what the hell is causing the
          earthquake. A large circle of ice near them MELTS. And then
          the first drone EXPLODES UP before them and LAUNCHES into the
          morning sky, peeling away to the east. Before they can react,
          the second drone EXPLODES UP a hundred yards away, peeling
          off to the west. They hear the third one about to rocket up--

          

          

          

          

          96.
          Snake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a
          Rock Slide, hauls-ass outside, hits a WEAPONS SWITCH on his
          Rock Slide, prepping two HEAT-SEEKING ROCKETS on either side
          of the vehicle. The third drone LAUNCHES UP from two hundred
          yards away. Snake-Eyes locks onto its exhaust and FIRES. The
          missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky.
          It EXPLODES. Metal FLIES. Snow BURNS.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The technicians see this on their monitors.

          TECHNICIAN
          We lost one.

          MCCULLEN
          Lost one? What do you mean?

          TECHNICIAN
          Bird Three is down, Sir.
          McCullen looks at the monitors, enraged. Storm Shadow smiles.

          STORM SHADOW
          We're under attack.

          MCCULLEN
          Alert all defences. Charge up the
          pulse cannon.
          He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room.

          EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          Topside, the team watches the two remaining drones race away.

          BREAKER
          What about the other two?

          RIPCORD
          We find the kill switches and short
          out the nano-mites.

          BREAKER
          (shakes his head)
          They're already way out of range.

          SCARLETT
          Then somebody has to go up there
          and shoot those things down.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          RIPCORD

          (PAUSE)
          That's me.

          INT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Ripcord climbs into the Night Raven's cockpit. Scarlett steps
          up to watch. He's already flipping switches and putting on a

          FLIGHT HELMET.

          SCARLETT
          Can you even fly this thing?

          RIPCORD
          I can fly anything. You just track
          those warheads and guide me in. We
          don't have long until they hit.

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord?
          He glances at her, a moment between them. Then she presses
          forward and kisses him on the mouth. He stares back at her.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          Good luck.

          RIPCORD
          Do me a favor? Save Duke.
          She gives him a nod, then leaves. Ripcord grins to himself.

          EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - DAY

          The NIGHT RAVEN tears across the ice and launches into the
          sky. Ripcord WHOOPS with adrenaline. Scarlett, Snake-Eyes,
          and Breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the
          ice REFORMS behind them, hiding the hole.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          We now find Duke, wearing only SURGICAL TROUSERS, strapped on
          the operating gurney we saw Zartan on earlier. The SMART
          ROBOTS warming up around him as the Doctor approaches.

          THE DOCTOR
          The atomic bomb that was dropped on
          Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent
          of the city. Seventy percent... Did
          you know that, Duke?

          

          

          

          

          98.
          Duke looks at him, something familiar.

          REX
          There was a bank situated less than
          one hundred yards from Ground Zero,
          destroyed of course. Only one thing
          survived. It's four bank vaults.
          And when those vaults were opened,
          they discovered everything inside
          them had survived completely
          unscathed.

          DUKE
          Who are you?

          THE DOCTOR
          Of course, the vault I took shelter
          in wasn't that well-made.
          He unclips his BREATHING TUBES and lowers the mask to reveal
          a scarred and burned face.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Double Bubble?
          Duke is beyond shocked.

          DUKE
          Rex...
          Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask
          over his face.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          You sonuvabitch... Ana buried you.

          THE DOCTOR
          A moving ceremony, I'm sure. The
          three volley salute. The flag on
          the coffin.

          DUKE
          Why? .Why didn't you come in...?

          THE DOCTOR
          Because I found out the truth...

          AND WE FLASHBACK TO: JUNGLE BUILDING - DAY
          Rex moves through the building with Fireteam Bravo.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          BRAVE SOLDIER
          Intel says the lab's in the
          basement.
          Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door. They lead the way down a
          staircase toward the basement. Rex follows, nervous as hell.
          The soldiers round a corner, suddenly, Rex hears GUNFIRE, he
          freezes, then silence, Rex pulls out his .45 And rounds the
          corner to see Fireteam Bravo down. A GUARD is trying to clear
          a jam in his machine gun. As he clears the weapon and raises
          it, Rex raises his .45 and fires first. The Guard drops.
          Rex checks Bravo, but they're not moving. He looks around the
          basement, no lab, but he sees a massive VAULT DOOR, closed.
          He heads for the vault, 45 raised, breathing hard. WHOOSH, a
           blast of refrigerated air hits him as he opens the door.
          Rex enters a small room filled with DEAD ANIMALS in huge
          FORMALDEHYDE JARS> Something inside the animals is constantly
          reshaping their appearances, reforming their facial bones and
          changing the color, texture and elasticity of their skins.
          There is a scuffling noise, Rex points his gun. A small,
          stooped old SCIENTIST in a lab coat appears.

          SCIENTIST
          Are you going to shoot me?...
          Rex doesn't respond.

          SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
          We knew you were coming. But I
          couldn't walk away from it...
          Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting.

          REX
          Stay where you are.
          His gun up, he finds a COMPUTER TERMINAL and begins accessing
          various files, starts reading them.

          REX (CONT'D)
          These aren't chemical or nuclear--

          SCIENTIST
          No. Something much... better.

          RES
          This is beyond anything... This is
          light years ahead of anyone in the
          field.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          SCIENTIST
          You see why I couldn't leave.
          Rex nods, hypnotized by the science in front of him, an
          instant bond formed with the man who created it. The distant
          sound of Jets. The Scientist moves to the vault door and
          begins pulling it closed as we hear the J-Dam Bunker Buster
          whistling towards them.

          SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
          If we live, I'll show you
          everything...

          WE SMASH CUT BACK TO THE MEDICAL WING - PRESENT
          Duke tries to absorb what he's learned. The Doctor continues.

          THE DOCTOR
          The man who created this technology
          was not our enemy. In fact, he was
          hired by our very own government to
          create it. When it was deemed too
          unethical, they sent us to kill
          him. He didn't survive the blast.
          But I... lived.
          (touches his face)
          And I escaped with his research.
          Unfortunately I tested it on myself
          first, and lost my lungs and vocal
          chords in the process. But now I've
          perfected it, and you will get a
          first-hand experience.

          DUKE
          (his biggest concern)
          Does Ana know about this, about
          you?

          THE DOCTOR
          No... and she never will.
          He glances at the SMART ROBOTS and Duke realizes.

          DUKE
          You sick bastard... you did this to
          your own sister?

          THE DOCTOR

          (INCENSED)
          I loved my sister! Do you have any
          idea the state she was in? Me dead.
          You AWOL. Depression, drugs.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          101.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          So, I had her brought here, gave
          her a way to deal with her pain,
          gave her purpose. Made her strong.
          I gave her a new life, Duke.

          DUKE
          Why work for McCullen?

          THE DOCTOR
          He saved my life, for starters. Now
          to mention infinite resources to
          work in the field of my choosing.

          DUKE
          That's bullshit. You could have had
          any job you wanted.

          THE DOCTOR
          I didn't want any job. You can't
          play nice with science, Duke. It's
          sometimes necessary to experiment,
          to fail, even to destroy to attain
          a goal. It's a fact that McCullen
          has the guts to embrace.

          DUKE
          (still shocked)
          Everything she's done, everything
          she's become, started because she
          thought you died that day.

          THE DOCTOR
          And because you then abandoned her,
          let's not forget that part.
          And with that, he leaves Duke to the SMART ROBOTS, which
          menacingly begin to move in.

          INT. LAUNCH BAY - DAY

          Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker drop down into the launch
          bay. They see a chrome corridor leading into the facility.

          SCARLETT
          It's pressure plated and laser
          protected. Anyway around it?

          BREAKER
          No. Any object larger than a
          quarter will fry your britches.
          Snake-Eyes shakes his head with a sigh, then steps forward
          and leaps onto the floor, landing on his fingertips.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          Then, with incredible strength, he proceeds to walk across
          the floor on his fingertips, aware of the continuous crackle
          and hum of lasers around him. Scarlett and Breaker watch with
          baited breath. Snake- Eyes now reaches the doorway.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          What you'll have to do is rewire
          the laser panel's brain by--
          --Snake-Eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips while
          his other fingers grab his sword and STAB the laser panel.
          The sound of the laser net instantly vanishes.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          .or you cold just stab it.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          Duke lies on the operating table as a SMART ROBOT makes an
          incision behind his right ear. Duke grimaces. A long needle
          zeroes in on the incision. As the needle dives towards Duke's
          head, a hand hits a switch and the needle quickly retracts.
          Duke looks over to see Ana by the controls, gazing at him.

          ANA
          I don't have much time.
          She rushes over and unties him and they stare at each other,
          then kiss passionately. All of a sudden, Duke feels something
          behind her right ear, he turns her head, --an INCISION SCAR.
          He looks at her, but before he can say anything, Ana's body
          snaps rigid and falls limp in his arms.

          DUKE
          Ana!
          Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding his PDA, McCullen
          and two Neo-Vipers beside him, their rifles on Duke and Ana.
          Duke gazes at Ana, desperately feeling for her pulse.

          INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Two TECHNICIANS man the firing controls of the huge TURBO
          LASER CANNON. Snake-Eyes takes them out and shuts down the
          cannon. HE sends a quick message on his WRIST-COMMUNICATOR.

          INT. CONN TOWER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees the message appear on a screen. "CANNON OFF-
          LINE. HAVE A NICE DAY." Heavy smiles and turns to Shipwreck.

          

          

          

          

          103.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Let's get in this fight.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          The GI JOE submarine peels around a rocky headland now, in
          full view of the underwater facility. A series of TORPEDOES
          fire out of the submarine's launch tubes. Most are blown up
          by the facility's Harpoon Cannon defenses, but several manage
          to hit the facility's exterior. KA-BOOM!!

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          The whole place SHUDDERS. Scarlett and Breaker blow the
          control room door and cut down the Technicians trying to
          shoot them. Breaker takes over a station console.

          BREAKER
          Okay, I've got a lock on the two
          remaining warheads. Target one is
          Moscow! Target Two is Washington!

          SCARLETT
          Give Ripcord the coordinates.

          INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Snake-Eyes spins to see a pair of KATANA BLADES come crashing
          down at him from behind.
          He spins, but one of the blades cuts him on his left arm,
          sending him reeling backwards, it's Storm Shadow. Who quickly
          powers the laser cannon back online. Snake-Eyes dives to stop
          him, --and as their swords meet WE FLASH CUT TO:
          THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two sixteen year-
          olds, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow, trade blows with wooden
          katanas. Storm Shadow drops Snake-Eyes, who falls hard, Storm
          Shadow steps on his throat, sword point in Snake- Eyes' face.
          Hard Master looks on without expression. FLASH CUT BACK TO:
          THE CONTROL ROOM, where Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow's blades
          flash like lightning, they battle fiercely around the room. A
          Neo-Viper charges up the controls. Snake can't stop him.

          

          

          

          

          104.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Outside, the massive TURBO-LASER swings wildly towards the
          submarine and fires. A BRILLIANT BLUE PULSE ripples through
          the arctic sea, glancing the side of the vessel. WHAM!!

          INT. CONN TOWER - DAY

          The submarine shakes hard. Rivets burst. Water pours in.

          SHIPWRECK
          The hull's been ruptured!

          HEAVY DUTY
          Everyone into the attack boats!

          EXT. SUBMARINE - DAY

          Hatches open along the sides of the submarine, deploying ten
          SHARC ATTACK CRAFT carrying dozens of Joes. At the same time,
          batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen MANTIS
          attack craft carrying dozens of Neo-Vipers emerge.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty and Shipwreck pilot one of the SHARCS. The huge
          opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Keep tight everybody.
          He fires a HARPOON TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis. The mantis
          craft RETURN FIRE. The whole area explodes in a pulse fire
          and harpoon blasts. The Joe submarine sinks and EXPLODES at
          the base of the facility.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          Duke cuddles dead Ana, clearly emotional. McCullen steps up.

          MCCULLEN
          Is she still alive?

          THE DOCTOR
          For now.

          MCCULLEN
          You said this couldn't happen.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          THE DOCTOR
          I didn't think it could. I've never
          seen anyone defeat the programming,
          even momentarily.
          Duke recovers and angrily grabs one of Ana's PISTOLS and
          kills the two Neo-Vipers, then turns the gun on the others.
          The Doctor lifts his PDA, finger on the "TERMINATE" BUTTON.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          If I press this, Ana dies.

          DUKE
          Put it down.

          THE DOCTOR
          Your choice, Duke.

          DUKE
          Put it down!
          The Doctor doesn't move. McCullen watches the stand-off his
          right hand discreetly drawing STEEL HOSE out from his sleeve.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the Night Raven,
          the curve of the Earth visible out his windows. Ahead, he can
          see a PULSATING LIGHT.

          RIPCORD
          I see it, dead ahead.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOL - DAY

          Breaker speaks into his headset.

          BREAKER
          You have to knock it down before it
          re-enters the atmosphere so the
          nano-mites don't reach the ground.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord flicks a switch and opens a PULSE LASER on the nose.

          RIPCORD
          Uh, I've got a problem. The fire
          controls are not in here.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          BREAKER'S VOICE
          What do you mean, not in there?

          RIPCORD
          I mean I can't see them anywhere!

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Scarlett hears this and realizes.

          SCARLETT
          It's gotta be voice-activated.

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          What?

          SCARLETT
          You have to say the words into your
          flight helmet.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord lines up the missile in his sights, gets a lock.

          RIPCORD
          Fire!
          (nothing happens)
          Shoot!
          (still nothing)
          Blast away!
          Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the
          Earth.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They hear Ripcord yelling over the speakers.

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          Nothing's happening!

          BREAKER
          Must be a different language.

          SCARLETT
          (to Ripcord)
          Try "teine".

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          What?

          

          

          

          

          107.

          SCARLETT
          It's Scottish for fire.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord's not sure about this, the missile arcing down.

          RIPCORD
          Teine.

          SCARLETT
          Listen to my voice, "Teine".

          RIPCORD
          Teine! Teine! Teine!
          (nothing happens)
          It's not working!

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          That's because you're not saying it
          right!

          RIPCORD
          How many different ways you want me
          to say it?

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          One way! The right way! Teine!

          RIPCORD
          Teine!
          And at last the PULSE LASER fires. Blasting the missile out
          of the sky. The CLOUD OF NANO-MITES floats aimlessly away.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They all see the missile disappear on their screen.

          BREAKER
          Nice work, Ace. You just saved
          Moscow.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord sighs with relief, already peeling away.

          RIPCORD
          Just doing my job. Guide me to the
          other drone...

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          108.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          (under his breath)
          .man, I freakin' saved Moscow!

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON - DAY

          The White House glistens in the midday sun.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY

          The American President's Bodyguards rush him and his staff
          down into a fortified bunker beneath the White House.

          PRESIDENT
          How soon will it strike the city?

          STAFFER
          Seventeen minutes, Sir.

          PRESIDENT
          This will be a disaster the likes
          of which we have never seen.
          As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS INDUSTRIES
          LOGO on the doors.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Another blast from the TURBO-LASER destroys a SHARC.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees this as he takes out a MANTIS.

          SHIPWRECK
          That cannon's going to kill us all.

          HEAVY DUTY
          My guy will take care of it, trust
          me.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          Snake-Eyes kills the Neo-Viper, who falls down a large shaft
          into freezing waters. Storm Shadow lunges at Snake-Eyes and
          the two of them tumble down into the shaft, but land on a
          gangway. They both leap up and begin to fight again. The Neo-
          Viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water, seemingly
          unfazed as he slowly freezes solid.

          

          

          

          

          109.
          All of a sudden, there's LOUD NOISES and a series of ENERGY
          LASERS power on up and down the shaft between various circuit
          modules. This is where the energy is charged to operate the
          cannon. One of the lasers catches Storm Shadow's shoulder and
          burns him severely. Snake-Eyes sees this and ducks just as an
          ENERGY LASER fires on beside his head.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Outside, the TURBO-LASER fires. The Joe craft desperately
          weave and dodge.

          INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          .and the LASER NET fades. Instantly, Storm Shadow and Snake-
          Eyes continue their desperate fight. Swords FLASH and CLANG,
          two masters at their best. AND WE FLASH CUT TO:
          THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two twenty-two
          year olds, Storm Shadow and Snake-Eyes sword fight. Storm
          Shadow knocks Snake-Eyes to the ground again and places his
          steel sword against Snake-Eyes' face. Again, Hard Master
          watches without expression. AND WE FLASH CUT BACK TO:
          THE ENERGY SHAFT, where Storm Shadow slashes Snake-Eyes
          across the chest, but before he can finish him off, the
          cannon charges up again and the LASER NET slams on. Storm
          Shadow twists his body to avoid the ENERGY LASERS while Snake-
          Eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that
          threatens to disintegrate his crotch. Storm Shadow sees this,
          grins to himself.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY

          A staffer is on the phone, looking up at the President.

          STAFFER
          It seems somebody's shot down the
          warhead heading for Moscow.

          PRESIDENT
          Thank God...
          As he says this, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED
          PISTOL and kills the other Agents and Staff. We see an
          INCISION SCAR behind his right ear and realize he is a Neo-
          Viper. The President stares, stunned and horrified. The Neo-
          Viper holds his pistol on the President as--

          

          

          

          

          110.
          --A BOOKCASE moves on the wall, revealing a secret room. An
          UNSEEN FIGURE emerges and the President stares in shock.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Up in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing
          down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him.

          RIPCORD
          Second drone in my sights.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Breaker and Scarlett watch in the control room.

          BREAKER
          Hurry, Rip. You've only got thirty
          seconds before it enters the lower
          atmosphere.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord's feeling the pressure. He targets the missile.

          RIPCORD
          Taine!
          But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Teine! Teine!

          RIPCORD
          Don't yell at me!

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Teine.
          Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves. A RED FUEL LIGHT
          starts beeping on his control board. Rip does his best to
          ignore it, focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear
          into the lower atmosphere. The light beats faster and louder.

          RIPCORD
          Teine!
          The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which
          is lost in the atmospheric haze below. For a moment, he can't
          tell if he hit it or not.

          

          

          

          

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The tracking in the control room provides the answer.

          BREAKER
          You missed! The warhead has entered
          the lower atmosphere!

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord realizes this as he enters the lower atmosphere
          himself. The spread of WASHINGTON D.C. Far below him now.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          In the operating chamber, the stand-off reaches its boiling
          point now. McCullen slowly approaching Duke who keeps Ana's
          pistol on the Doctor, Ana still in Duke's arms.

          MCCULLEN
          Did you think she loved you?

          DUKE
          Stay back!

          MCCULLEN
          Did you imagine your life with her?

          DUKE
          I said stay back!

          THE DOCTOR
          Don't you know you've lost, Duke?

          DUKE
          All I know is that neither of you
          deserves her.
          McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand--
          --A BURST OF FLAME tears out at Duke who reflexively fires
          the PULSE PISTOL at it. The intense air blast from the pulse
          pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them
          back onto McCullen. McCullen SCREAMS as his face is literally
          burned off. The Doctor freaks and drops the PDA, then yanks
          McCullen out into the corridor. Duke fires after them, then
          grabs the PDA, removing Ana's screen with a sigh of relief.

          

          

          

          

          112.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVE - SKIES - DAY

          Above Washington, Ripcord guns his aircraft after the falling
          drone. Getting real close this time. No way he can miss.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see this on the screens in the control room.

          BREAKER
          You're too close, Rip. Back up.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord gets eerily calm all of a sudden.

          RIPCORD
          Actually, I think I'm just about
          close enough...

          (PAUSE)
          .teine.
          The PULSE LASER fires point blank. The missile EXPLODES right
          in front of him. Ripcord flies through the flames, the CLOUD
          OF NANO-MITES latching onto his wings.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The drone disappears from their screens now.

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord? What happened? Rip!

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord is now struggling mightily with his controls as the
          NANO-MITES swiftly eat his plane.
          His FUEL LIGHT flashes at him alarmingly. He angles the Night
          Raven upwards, giving it all he's got, NANO-MITES everywhere.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see his plane angle back up into the upper atmosphere.

          

          

          

          

          113.

          BREAKER
          He's taking the nano-mites back up
          into the upper atmosphere.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          The Night Raven is breaking up all around Ripcord now. He
          quickly attaches his flight helmet's BREATHING MASK.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          Ripcord turns the plane over, inverting it.

          RIPCORD
          Cur magh!
          The canopy explodes. Rip shoots back down into the atmosphere
          as the NANO-MITES devour the Night Raven, then float away...

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see this on their screens.

          BREAKER
          He did it... He actually did it...

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord? Talk to me...Ripcord!
          Still nothing. And now they begin to suspect the worst. Then:

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          I asked you not to yell at me.
          Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker.

          SCARLETT
          What happened? Are you okay?

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          Yeah, did it work?

          SCARLETT
          Yes...yes, it worked.

          EXT. PARACHUTE - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord smiles, parachuting down towards Washington.

          

          

          

          

          114.

          RIPCORD
          (into headset)
          Good...cause I think I'm about to
          get arrested.

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          Ripcord lands on the White House lawn, holding his hands up
          benignly as dozens of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS surround him.

          INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          ENERGY LASERS pulse on again, almost catching the two ninjas
          in their fight. Snake-Eyes draws his KATANA SWORD, its blade
          shimmering in the laser-light as he redirects the laser back
          into its module. Storm Shadow does the same with his sword,
          barely saving his neck. They glare at each other.
          AND WE FLASH CUT TO THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where the two 26
          year-olds fight with katanas. Storm Shadow presses forward,
          Snake-eyes side-steps and hurls Storm Shadow to the ground!
          He steps up and puts his sword tip in Storm Shadow's eye.
          Snake-Eyes first ever win over Storm Shadow.
          Hard Master CLAPS ONE TIME. Storm Shadow looks at his father,
          he can't believe it, his father seems happy for Snake-Eyes.
          He slaps the sword away, gets up and stalks off.
          FLASH BACK TO: The cannon fires and the lasers disappear,
          freeing them to continue their duel. This is it. The final
          duel. Snake-Eyes struggles, exhausted and wounded. Storm
          Shadow puts in every ounce of hate he has left. He finally
          tears Snake-Eyes' sword away and kicks him down. About to go
          for the final kill. But before we find out the climax to
          their fight, we must finish their story:
          ON THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE GROUNDS, Snake-Eyes, still 26, walks
          along the pond. He hears a LOUD CRY. Snake-Eyes breaks into a
          run, careens around a building and sees Hard Master slumped
          on the ground, a sword in his back.

          SNAKE-EYES
          Master!
          Other NINJAS come flooding in.

          NINJA #1
          That's Storm Shadow's sword!

          NINJA #2
          There! There's the murderer!

          

          

          

          

          115.
          Snake-Eyes spins to see Storm Shadow climb up the side of the
          Temple, onto the rood, give him a last look, and jump down
          over the wall. FLASH BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT where Snake-
          Eyes is suddenly filled with renewed energy, he stares up at
          Storm Shadow's katana blade poised for the final kill.

          STORM SHADOW
          You took your vow of silence to
          avenge our Master. But now you will
          die without a word.
          The LOUD NOISE gears up again, distracting Storm Shadow for
          just a beat. Snake-Eyes uses the moment to catch Storm shadow
          with his feet, holding him up for a split second as the
          ENERGY LASERS come back on. One of them burns deeply across
          Storm Shadow's neck, he SCREAMS and stumbles back and falls
          OVER THE EDGE and down into the freezing turgid waters. Snake-
          Eyes steps up and looks down to see if he surfaces... He
          doesn't.

          SNAKE-EYES
          Father always feared it would come
          to this.
          EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now. Snake-Eyes stumbles
          towards the exit, leaving his fallen Sword Brother behind.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees the cannon return to its dormant position.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Turbo-laser is down!
          He guns his engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft. It
          EXPLODES. Heavy Duty howls with delight.
          Around him, the Joes begin to turn the tide of the battle. A
          SERIES OF SHOTS of Mantis vehicles getting nailed by Joe
          harpoon cannons.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They feel the EXPLOSIONS in the control room. Screens short
          out. Water starts to cascade in through BURSTING RIVETS.

          BREAKER
          Energy overload in the phased array
          battery. Power subsystems are going
          critical.

          

          

          

          

          116.

          SCARLETT
          Let's get out of here!
          Scarlett grabs Breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls
          him out of the room.

          INT. TRIDENT - DAY

          McCullen's face is horrifically burned as The Doctor helps
          him down into the Trident. EXPLOSIONS blowing above them. The
          pilots guide the sub out white the Doctor starts injecting
          McCullen with NANO-MITES. McCullen starts to SCREAM...

          INT. DIVING BELL ENTRY PORT - DAY

          Scarlett and Breaker races into the diving bell entry port
          and are shocked to find Snake-Eyes already here. Scarlett
          runs up and gently hugs him.

          SCARLETT
          Snake!
          Snake-Eyes grimaces, then looks Scarlett in the eyes.

          SNAKE-EYES
          .he's dead.
          She knows who he means, she gives him a grim smile. And
          that's when they see Duke, carrying Ana, charging up to them.
          Another EXPLOSION makes them all dash into the diving bell.
          The doors close and we hear them launch.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty notices the Trident escaping out of the EXPLODING
          docking bay into the arctic water. He angles towards the sub.

          HEAVY DUTY
          We got a runner! Cut him off!
          All of a sudden, the whole damn facility EXPLODES.
          INSIDE THE DIVING BELL: Our heroes are rocked by the BLAST,
          then they see MASSIVE CHUNKS OF POLAR ICE plummet down from
          the ice pack above, cutting off Heavy Duty and the Joes, and
          DEMOLISHING the remainder of the facility. The Trident
          disappears behind the trillions of bubbles and falling ice.

          

          

          

          

          117.

          INT/EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Shipwreck checks his targeting scanner.

          SHIPWRECK
          All other targets neutralized.

          HEAVY DUTY

          GO JOES!!

          EXT. TRIDENT - UNDERWATER - DAY

          The Trident is moving fast through the water somewhere.

          INT. TRIDENT - UNDERWATER - DAY

          McCullen turns to us and we see that the NANO-MITES have
          created a FORM-FITTING MASK all over his face. He catches his
          reflection in the portal and he grabs at the mask, the NANO-
          MITES twisting with the contours of his muscles to reveal his
          complete and ever-lasting horror. He breaks down, falling to
          the floor, then he recovers and looks up at The Doctor.

          MCCULLEN
          I guess I should thank you, Doctor.
          The Doctor is busy fiddling with his hand held PDA.

          THE DOCTOR
          I want you to call me... Commander.
          (looks at McCullen)
          And from now on, I'll be on a first
          name basis with you, Destro.
          McCullen's silver face goes blank.

          MCCULLEN
          Yes, Commander.

          INT. VIEWING ROOM - MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY

          Duke watches Ana through a two-way mirror. She sits alone in
          a holding cell. A MILITARY SCIENTIST watches her with Duke. -

          SCIENTIST
          Physically, she's fine. But without
          the correctly-coded kill frequency,
          we can't short them out.

          

          

          

          

          118.

          DUKE
          There's nothing you can do?

          SCIENTIST
          Only the man who put them in there
          has the correct code.
          Duke considers this carefully, staring at Ana.

          INT. CORRIDOR - MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY

          Duke walks along a prison corridor with Ana, led by two
          PRISON GUARDS. She carries a small bundle of PRISON GEAR.

          DUKE
          I'll visit you.

          ANA
          I won't be here long.

          DUKE
          You'll be here for the rest of your
          life, Ana.
          She looks at him, her face softening.

          ANA
          Duke?

          DUKE
          I'm here.

          ANA
          After all I've done, .you can't
          save me, .it's too late.
          A BEAT passes between them.

          DUKE
          I'll visit you.
          And for a moment, she appears to crack... but then a
          sinister smile creases her mouth.

          ANA
          You know, this has only just begun.
          She touches his face, then the PRISON BARS slam shut between
          them. She holds his eyes a moment longer, then the two Prison
          Guards lead her away. Duke just watches her go, his face torn
          with pain. He walks off alone...

          

          

          

          

          119.

          INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY

          General Hawk is in his wheelchair, still recovering from his
          wounds. He leads Duke and ripcord to the Howler.

          HAWK
          With GI JOE reinstated, would you
          boys like to stay on awhile?

          DUKE
          What do you say, Rip?
          Ripcord looks at Scarlett, who throws him a wink and a smile.

          RIPCORD
          I'm good.
          They all laugh. Rip steps up to her.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          So how do you feel about this?

          SCARLETT
          I feel very... emotional.
          Duke smiles and the Joes climb aboard as the platform rises.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL OFFICES - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          A bevy of SECRETARIES and STAFFERS greets the President. Then
          he enters the Oval office and closes the door, alone, he
          looks around, walks behind the desk, and grins as he sits, as
          if this is the first time he's ever done this. With a little
          flair, he CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and we realize this is Zartan!
          And we SMASH CUT TO BLACK and ROLL CREDITS...

    Some years from this exact moment...

1   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  1

    DARKNESS - NOW

    The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the
    COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face.

    They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS
    FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding
    into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's
    dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track
    and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and
    hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel-
    eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.

    ZERO IN on TWO:
    KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes
    burning with internalized emotion...

    ... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell -
    both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported
    through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around.

    Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their
    swagger seems to mask FEAR.

    KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell.   The GIRL
    makes eye contact w/ him.

                                   SANDRA
                  Sandra.

    KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.

                            SANDRA (cont'd)
                  My name is Sandra.

                            GUARD
                  Shut the fuck up.

    Because he can, the GUARD takes a swing at KABLE'S head with
    a BILLY CLUB... CRACK!

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                    2.

    KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings
    again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach.

                           SANDRA
                     (to the GUARD, a snarl)
                 Putcher dick away...

                             GUARD
                 Get some.

    CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!!     SANDRA is buckled
    over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat,
    head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints,
    every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART...
    He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights
    through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle
    herself.

    The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a
    glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing
    it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the
    others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN -
    growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting
    out all thought... until...

2   INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY                                                    2

    POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL
    towards dirty white DAYLIGHT...

    NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound
    of his boots bouncing off the concrete...

    Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the
    tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke,
    sky...

    Our POV WHITES OUT as we...

3   EXT. SPAWN POINT #1 - CONTINUOUS                                        3

    ... smash into the DAYLIGHT.

    Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over
    burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers
    disappear into the grey mist.

4   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                            4

    KABLE emerges from the smoke into...




                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                                3.

    ... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out
    of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an
    OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella
    2005).

    In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -
    accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce
    somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin,
    then snap into place. GO TIME.

5   OTHER SPAWN POINTS                                                  5

    Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and
    INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.

6   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                             6

    What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a
    closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like
    hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits
    apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they
    hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.

7   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER                                     7

    KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES
    COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade
    away... until...

    NOTHING.   DEAD QUIET.

    SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN
    we hear a GUNSHOT.

    Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -
    after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the
    lightning, wait for the thunder.

    In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from
    behind an old car to a brick staircase.   Then another BLUE
    runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.
    BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...

    BOOM.

    ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN...
    KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly
    shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE
    into the mist:

    THOOM! THOOM!   The shells puncture air and connect
    distantly...


                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                 4.

    The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he
    breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS
    READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic
    fire.

8   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET                                8

    A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally
    IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut
    and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM
    holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.

    From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE
    combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS.   In the top right corner
    of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat
    transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to
    your own reflection on a TV).

    We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.
    KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the
    third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND
    SPEAKERS, behind us:

    A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be
    outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly
    belong to KABLE.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
                     (clean, disconnected)
                 Eat shit please.

    THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts
    back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.
    Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store.

    A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a
    bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem
    almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his
    left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting
    the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT
    TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some
    clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the
    ground, dead.

    Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on
    him. Uh oh...

    BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the
    knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing
    straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles
    over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.

     VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH
     THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way
     and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt
     flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.

9    SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET                                        9

     Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting
     obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing
     truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN
     WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting
     obliterated by another TRUCK.   It's creepy - robotic, but
     violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Can't say I didn't try...

     We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to
     the peripheral.

10   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - 2ND FLOOR BUILDING                          10

     Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking
     aim; we SNAP ZOOM in...

     SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE:

     The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on
     glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with:

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Shit! Shit!

     KABLE spins, TOO LATE -

     BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an
     open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP
     THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.

11   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET                                      11

     The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT
     collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA.

     KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They
     bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops
     to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant -

     HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O.          Blood and particles splatter
     over KABLE's gear.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                  Suckage.

     Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES.

     Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small
     GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS. He makes for it.

     The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a
     stray shot - PLINK!

                            VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  ... what the...!

     Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's
     QUICK...

     A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his
     feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE
     BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH.

     He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.

12   INT. SAVE POINT #1                                                12

     KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The
     second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all
     around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from
     loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING
     DOWN.

     The battle is over - session complete.

13   EXT. SAVE POINT #1                                                13

     KABLE steps out.    The LEDS on his weapon blink off in
     sequence...

     ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's.

     [I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row
     inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage.

     GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that
     lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they
     are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty
     thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by
     participating to commute their sentences]

     A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His
     eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from
     him.

     HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON, POINTS IT AT A GUARD'S HEAD AND PULLS
     THE TRIGGER -

     NOTHING. The GUARD doesn't even flinch. The WEAPON is DEAD,
     dormant; they all knew it.

     The GUARDS have a good LAUGH... KABLE is CLUBBED from behind -
     we...

     Back on the rattling TRAIN, where we started. The SURVIVING
     SOLDIERS - both BROWN and BLUE - are shackled to the rail -
     wounded, exhausted, hollow eyed.

                            BLUE SOLDIER 1
                  Good run, Kable.

     KABLE only looks to the floor.

                            KABLE
                      (quietly)
                  My name's Tillman.

                            BROWN SOLDIER 1
                  Whatever your name is. You got to
                  the save point fast.

                            BROWN SOLDIER 2
                  So the fuck what? No one's getting
                  out of here alive.

                             BLUE SOLDIER 1
                  I am.   I'm going to make it.

     The cynical BROWN just shakes his head.

                            BROWN SOLDIER 2
                  Sure you will.

                            BLUE SOLDIER 1
                      (tuning the BROWN out,
                       turning his attention to
                       KABLE)
                  They say you only got three battles
                  left til you get out...

     KABLE says nothing.

     The CAMERA pushes in on a TATTOO on his forearm: a simple
     outline of a black box with the words inside: I AM RIGHT HERE
     WITH YOU.

     [MUSIC: Aldo Nova, "LIFE IS JUST A FANTASY" kicks in...]

15   INT. LAB - TIME INDETERMINATE                                        15

     A spartan, underground LAB.

     A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE;
     on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of
     him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic
     FLIES.

     He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes
     right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he
     could ever touch it.

     Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the
     remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK.

     CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one
     side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air.
     There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end.

     The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the
     lens up to his eyes. Switch to:

     POV of the FLY CAM: the TECH'S face, extreme wide angle,
     examining. The image flickers, glitches - then CUTS TO:

     WHITE NOISE.

     CASTLE is opposite GINA PARKER SMITH, both identified by
     translucent animated CHYRONS. CASTLE is older now than in
     the earlier clip; early 40s - his body is more solid; hair
     cut shorter, conservative. But the eyes still SPARKLE.

                            GINA PARKER SMITH
               Slayers.

                         KEN CASTLE
                   (big smile)
               Slayers.

     CASTLE'S accent is like pure Georgia honey.           He's a rock-
     ribbed charmer.

                         GINA PARKER SMITH
                   (down to business)
               Why isn't it murder?

     She leans in, playing the role of hard-hitting reporter to a
     T.

                         KEN CASTLE
               Gina, when was the last time you
               saw someone volunteer to be
               murdered? I'm sure you know that
               every last one of our Slayers is a
               bona fide death row inmate -
                   (points for emphasis)
               ...each one offered a chance to
               participate as an alternative to
               their sentence. Stay alive for
               thirty sessions and get set free...
               that's not a bad God damned deal.

                         GINA PARKER SMITH
               I see - and has any one of these
               men or women ever actually survived
               long enough to be set free?

     KEN just smiles, locks in on her eyes.

                  I'd remind your audience that
                  Slayers was put together with the

                  the United States federal
                  government... that the revenue it

                  our entire prison system - keeping
                  the bad guys behind bars... and
                  that the prop was voted for by a

                            GINA PARKER SMITH (cont'd)
                  Sent into the slayers environment
                  with a set of pre-programmed
                  actions, with no way to react and
                  no one controlling them - their
                  chances of survival are next to
                  nil.

                            KEN CASTLE
                  There's a lot of men and women in
                  prison that could never cut it as
                  slayers... shouldn't they have the
                  same opportunity to roll the dice
                  for a ticket out? Besides - they
                  only need to survive one session.

     THROW TO the LIVE STUDIO BROADCAST -

                            GINA PARKER SMITH
                      (leaning in)
                  Mr. Castle - how the hell does it
                  work?

                               KEN CASTLE
                  Simple.

     A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the
     VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - and
     then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  It begins with a single nano-cell
                  planted in the motor cortex of the
                  brain -- this cell can replicate,
                  replacing the cells `round it with
                  perfect copies...

     We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a
     bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell
     next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has
     turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues,
     multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that
     the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  ... these copied cells contain
                  remote access functionality.
                  Therefore, nano plus cortex equals
                  the nanex.

     The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands
     working a retro ATARI-style joystick... animated waves
     indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the
     Slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action.


                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Geek, geek, geek - come on, Castle,
                  you promised us a demonstration.

     CASTLE smiles broadly.

                      (coy)
                  Did I? You know I seem to recall
                  that - let's just see...

     CASTLE waves in his PERSONAL SECURITY:

     A half dozen GEEKS in BLACK JEANS, BLACK T-SHIRTS w/ WHITE
     SOCKS and SNEAKERS; BACKPACKS... yes, even FANNY PACKS. A
     full range of GEEK VARIATIONS: beard/mustache combos, thick
     glasses, pony tails, etc.

     One GEEK brings out the CUTEST, SOFTEST little SPANIEL PUPPY
     in the world and places it in CASTLE'S LAP.

     Meanwhile several OTHERS are directing HANDHELD SENSORS at
     GINA and thumb-clicking to establish TRACKING POINTS - her
     slightest movements are scanned and interpreted as data in
     real time.

                            GINA PARKER SMITH
                      (fighting it)
                  Oh... my god. So cute.

                            KEN CASTLE
                  You like her? Her name is Gina.
                  She's a good little bitch.

     Somehow, in his sweet southern drawl this rolls off almost
     acceptable. The CREW has a laugh off-screen; GINA blushes.

                            GINA PARKER SMITH
                  I beg your pardon?

                  Similar, yep. But control is
                  strictly localized to the
                  parameters of our gaming

     ON THE SCREEN, the humanz logo dissolves, 8-bit ARCADE STYLE,
     replaced by:

                  THE EVOLUTION OF MAN ACCORDING TO CASTLE

     Underneath is the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION showing the
     progression from primitive EARLY MAN to the erect MODERN
     HUMAN. In a crude ANIMATION the progression CONTINUES:
     MODERN MAN bends back over on his hands and knees; in the
     final stage he's wearing a DOG COLLAR, getting fucked in the
     ass - then fed through a MEAT GRINDER, packaged & sold as
     HAMBURGER.

     KEN looks over at the PRODUCER.

28   EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY                                         28

     A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE
     POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood
     sprays on white.

     We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD
     wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other
     prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a
     half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in
     the same white powder - they look like tribesmen.

     One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly        *
     enjoying the show.

                         DISTINCTIVE PRISONER                            *
               Fuck him up.

     The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a
     chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant
     towers mark the perimeter.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               20.

     Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the
     distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta
     smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind.

     The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last
     time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops
     moving.

     The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain.

     A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners.
     They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind
     to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive.

     In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses
     between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by
     an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body
     goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.

                                                          CUT TO:

29   EXT. PRISON REC AREA - DAY                                      29

     Fingers run through white powder, making patterns.

     A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hum;
     some sort of aircraft.

     KABLE looks up as the shadow tracks across him; we never see
     the craft. He looks out across the yard.

     KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut
     out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white
     cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard
     a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE
     PLAYER is SKYING for dunks.

     We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You...

     In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks
     ROBOTICALLY along on crutches. KABLE watches him,
     expressionless. It triggers a memory...

                                                        FLASH TO:

30   EXT. SUN-SOAKED EXTERIOR                                        30

     A LITTLE GIRL, no more than two, walks along on her DADDY'S
     feet... giggling, trusting... her hands grip his big
     fingers... taking each big ROBOT STEP with him...

                                                        FLASH TO:

                                                                21.

31   EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY                                           31

     A BASKETBALL comes out of nowhere and KNOCKS THE CRUTCH OUT
     from under the CRIPPLE, sending him ass-up on the asphalt.
     Prisoners JEER.

                         FREEK
                   (quiet, conspiratorial)
               Kable. Kable.

     We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with
     his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice he
     runs his hand through it, wiping it away.

     A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to
     KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look.

                         KABLE
               My name is Tillman, freak.

                         FREEK

               never know you gonna die today or
               live another two, three. You never

               to go... no one ever got that close
               before, no one even done ten games
               without gettin they brains shot...
               but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just
               sittin, lookin, like he got a plan,

               business, niggaz get spooked by
               that shit. You spooky.

     KABLE turns slowly to look him in the eye, says nothing.

                           FREEK (cont'd)
               Spooky.

     KABLE looks away.

     KABLE waits a good long beat.

                  I killed my best friend.

32   INT. PRISON - NIGHT                                                 32

     A prisoner sings Metallica off key, but balls to the walls:

                            PRISONER
                  Master!
                  Master!
                  Master of Puppets I'm pulling your
                  strings - Twisting your mind and
                  smashing your dreams...

     KABLE is alone in his cell.

     At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to
     push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, someone
     pushes through a wrinkled photograph.

     KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN, just a blur of golden
     hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABLE'S
     vision.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  You want to get back to them.

     KABLE is stunned, silent. He sits on the ground, shoulder
     leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in the
     picture.

                            WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  It's all you think about. It's the
                  only thing that keeps you alive.

     Her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep
     but he's too strong, too internalized. He steels himself.

                            KABLE
                  Who's talking?

     She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN.

                               WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Sign it.

                               KABLE
                  What?

                                                                       23.

     KABLE doesn't take it.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Sign it... please, Tillman. My son
                  David is your biggest fan. He
                  prays for you.

     This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen
     and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back
     through the slider.

     PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she
     draws out a little blood.

     KABLE yanks his hand back out.

                            WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  Need to prove it's authentic.
                  Makes it worth more.

                            KABLE
                  Why would anyone want my name?

                             WOMAN (O.S.)
                  You don't even know what's going on
                  out there, do you?
                      (beat)
                  Damn...

     At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then
     the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel.

                              WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  Gotta go.

     KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a
     lifeline is slipping away...

                             KABLE
                  Wait.
                      (he holds the wrinkled
                        photo to the window)
                  How did you get this picture?            Have
                  you seen them?

     He peers through the little window at the top of the door,
     but she's GONE...

     Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor
     to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from
     the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was
     being beaten down.

     A desolate white RUNNING TRACK; a guard TOWER overlooks...
     the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE.

     He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're
     right there with him, CLOSE-UP - profile, full speed... we
     hear the HARD BREATHING, the feet pounding dirt, like we're
     INSIDE HIS HEAD.

                                                              CUT TO:

     KABLE finally flames out... he breaks down to a jog, then
     doubles over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath.

     CUT OUT WIDE: KABLE is ant-size and insignificant on the
     long, barren field, under a vast grey sky... ALONE.

     CHAOS, CONFUSION... KABLE blasts through a cloud of exploding
     debris... A BROWN to his left is BLOWN IN HALF - the LEGS
     KEEP RUNNING...

42   EXT. SLAYER BATTLEGROUND #2 - STREET                                    42

     TED NUGENT, in BROWN camo, lines up a BLUE SNIPER in a 3rd
     story window with a CROSS-BOW. He releases the arrow and
     pins the BLUE's HEAD to the window sill.

                            TED NUGENT
                  Damn, I gonna have to eat you now,
                  son.

     An UPSIDE-DOWN CAR comes SLIDING down the street on it's hood
     and slams into TED NUGENT, VAPORIZING him...

43   EXT SLAYER BATTLEGROUND #2                                              43

     Another five BLUE SOLDIERS are taken out. Their bodies drop
     to the ground, gruesome goodness. The FIVE BALL BEARING
     CAMERAS quickly flock together and check out each body as a
     swarming unit. From a wider shot, they look like flies on
     shit... after checking out the recently deleted, they zip off
     towards the closest save point...

                                                                 CUT TO:          *

     FIFTY beer slamming COLLEGE STUDENTS are going BERSERK...
     they've got SLAYERS on a wall-sized screen, pay-per-view...
     they're high fiving, SMASHING up the place...                                *

46   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - DRAINAGE DITCH - CONTINUOUS       46

     KABLE LEAPS for a drainage trench, makes it, and hustles
     around the back of a burnt out building...

47   INT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - STAIRWAY                          47

     Up a stairway - the GHOST FACE on GLASS superimposed on the
     image - the face is LAUGHING, GIDDY...

                         VOICE
               Oh shit... oh shit...

48   INT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - 2ND FLOOR                         48

     KABLE takes up a spot from a second level vantage point -
     from here we see a small group of BLUES moving down the
     block, scanning for survivors.

                         VOICE
               Wul hello thar...

     KABLE watches himself SWITCH TURRETS on his WEAPON.   He
     brings up a SNIPER SIGHT and locks in on a target.

                         VOICE (cont'd)
               Wait for it...

     CLOSE-UP of KABLE'S EAR: just then he hears the SUBTLEST OF
     SOUNDS creeping up behind. Whoever's controlling him doesn't
     seem to have noticed - he's too focused on the enemies in the
     sights.

     We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless,
     trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice.

                         KABLE
                   (whispering)
               Turn me around God damn it...

                         VOICE
               What'd he say?

     A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE. The SOUND is
     more distinct now, CLOSER... he's practically shaking from
     the struggle to overcome the control.

     POV: someone has reached the top of the stairs... KABLE, seen
     from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out
     window.

                          VOICE (cont'd)
               My boy gotta take a piss or
               something?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

     FINALLY: SNAP ZOOM on a reflection in a shard of HANGING
     WINDOW GLASS - the outline of a BLUE, raising his gun...

                            VOICE (cont'd)
                  D'oh.

     KABLE SPINS - FAST. The TURRET is ALREADY REVOLVING when he
     squeezes the trigger...

     The ARMOR-PIERCING SHELL takes SNEAKY BLUE by surprise,
     blowing him out the back of the building...

     The BLUES in the street take notice. It's a matter of
     seconds...

     KABLE makes a run for it as the floor starts to DISINTEGRATE
     behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. SHRAPNEL drills his
     back, absorbed by the BODY ARMOR.

49   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2                                            49

     He hits daylight and turns a corner in time to see a group of                *
     BROWNS scattering... a live ARTILLERY SHELL skitters across                  *
     the pavement, belching smoke.                                                *

     BOOM.

     KABLE is running... he looks to his right - A FROZEN MOMENT:

     The SAVE POINT up ahead on the SPINNING RAILROAD.                            *

     The MOMENT passes; KABLE looks back over his shoulder - a
     rush of ROARING FLAME is COMING - FAST... at the moment of
     IMPACT we -                                                                  *

50   INT. THE TRAIN - TIME INDETERMINATE                                     50

     SOLDIERS are charred, bleeding, wasted.

     A BROWN is sobbing uncontrollably.

                            BROWN SOLDIER
                  Who are they... who the fuck are
                  they... who's playing us?

     KABLE watches him, wondering the same damn thing.

52   INT. SIMON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY                                     52

     SIMON - 18, pale and lanky, unkempt shaggy hair; wearing a
     vintage Guns `n' Roses T-shirt from the Appetite For
     Destruction Tour - walks down a long, high ceilinged crystal
     hall with marble floors, macking on the sandwich... passes
     through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a
     massive, exotic aquarium - he's alone in what appears to be a
     vast, cold mansion.

53   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   53

     SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each one a
     3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the
     screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON
     himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TECH
     SPACE.

     The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STUNT
     JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows,
     sandwich intact.

     The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing for
     prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK
     TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, etc.
     Everything dynamic, everything moving.

     One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the
     SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS
     LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these
     categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name
     illustrates the point.

     In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention:

                    KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS

     A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series
     of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR.

     SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTURES -
     he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by
     moving his fingers in the air.

     He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS...

                  Gay... gay... gay... super gay...
                  hm.

     He stops on an animated graphic. A SEXY FEMALE VOICE breaks
     it all down for us:

                            FEMALE VOICE
                  Swarmers. The latest innovation
                  from Browning, this self detonating
                  cartridge offers the widest and
                  deadliest spray available from a
                  full tracking, cornering ordnance.

     A VIDEO DEMO shows the fired cartridge SPLIT into two-dozen
     smaller shells that FLASH OUT like a swarm of bees, wind
     around a corner and utterly SHRED a TEST DUMMY.

                            SIMON
                  Daddy like...

     An ANNOYING GIRL'S VOICE pops in, along with a VID CHAT
     SCREEN that takes over the MAIN WALL. She looks about 16 -
     skinny, skanky, kind of hot.

                              ANNOYING GIRL
                  Simon!

                            SIMON
                  Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want
                  you unmuted I'll unmute you.

                            ANNOYING GIRL
                  You suck, Simon - you're going to
                  get my boyfriend killed before he
                  can get out of jail and fill me up
                  with his hot seed.

                              SIMON
                  Uh huh.

     Another GIRL - 17, cute, stoned - chimes in.

                            CUTE STONED GIRL
                  Simon, I just wanna play you.
                  Forget about that star-fucker.

                            ANNOYING GIRL
                  Shut up bitch.

     SIMON casually waves his hand at the frame, like flicking at
     a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED GIRL
     to the forefront.

               Thanks baby. When can I meet you
               for like reals?

     SIMON notices a metallic sparkle from the GIRL'S TONGUE.

                         SIMON
               What is that?
                   (like a dentist)
               Aaaa.

     He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close as
     she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen
     wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh,
     TEN FEET HIGH.

                            SIMON (cont'd)
               Woah.

     He quickly unsqueezes, zooming back out. The GIRL'S eyes are
     rolled back in her head, euphoric; she's WASTED.

                         CUTE STONED GIRL
               You like me?

     A THIRD GIRL pops in, filling the opposite wall.

                         SHELLY
               What's up, loser?

                            SIMON
               Hey sissy.

     This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14.       Frosted up lips, eyes
     and hair like a Tokyo hooker.

                         SHELLY
               Mom says - let me see, go to
               college, move the fuck out, and...
               oh yeah, you're a sick retard,
               you're pathetic, and you smell like
               Jeffrey Dahmer.

                         SIMON
               Wanna make out?

                         SHELLY
               You wish. I can't wait til they
               cut you off, Simian.

     With a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen.

     TWO MORE video chats pop up - TWIN 21-YEAR OLD GIRLS,
     stupidly hot.

     SIMON snaps his fingers; all the windows close
     simultaneously.

     SIMON makes a clicking sound with his tongue in the new
     silence. Peace at last.

     BY THEMSELVES, the screens come BACK TO LIFE.

                            SIMON (cont'd)
               D'oh.

     The instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless,
     GRAINY VIDEO LOOP - there is something sinister about the lo-
     fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE
     CAM:

     Two men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them
     seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun...

                         SIMON (cont'd)
               What the fuh...?

     ... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD.
     Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats.

     When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON
     freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN.

     It's KABLE.

     A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time -
     we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video
     prank earlier:

                            want to talk to him?

     Then, blinking, lo-fi in the lower right corner of the wall:

     MUSIC: Bloodhound Gang, The Bad Touch:

     Ha-ha, well now, we call this the act of mating
     But there are several other very important differences
     Between human beings and animals
     That you should know about...

     You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
     So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel...

     PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the
     lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us...

     We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE,
     skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly
     follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops,
     belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs...
     ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs...

     They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced
     with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face
     plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING
     PARTY!!!

     We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated,
     but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is
     heightened, off-kilter.

     On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a
     WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big
     plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS...

     A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS,
     totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS,
     out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The
     SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare
     legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but
     STILL GRINNING ecstatically...

     A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium
     balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of
     interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED...

     People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on
     the ground... and in the middle of it all...

55   EXT. SOCIETY                                                     55

     CLOSE-UP: a SPARROW is pecking at a hunk of orange and yellow
     CANDY CORN.

     POP OUT WIDE to reveal that the BIRD is EATING OUT OF A
     GIRL'S HAND...

     This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt,
     fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind
     them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like
     someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to
     notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the
     middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.

     She spots a GUY standing by himself near a giant sculpture.
     She walks over to him; the BIRD flutters away.

     The GUY is young and attractive, dressed in casual business
     attire. He is wearing a PLASTIC PIG SNOUT on his face, tied
     with an elastic band.

                            GUY
                  Hey.

     He smiles like a Driver's License photo.

     CLOSE-UP of LIPS, profile - by the looks of it, an OVERWEIGHT
     MALE... sweat, stubble. The ROOM is DARK - lit by the
     AMBIENT GLOW of a VIDEO SCREEN.

                            GORGE
                  Hi.

57   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                               57

     ANGIE echoes, practically overlapping.

                            ANGIE
                  Hi.

     We will continue to CUT between the two locations.

                            GUY
                  So what's your damage?

     He WINKS.

     ANGIE strikes an exaggeratedly DEMURE, FLIRTATIOUS POSE -
     then immediately snaps back to NEUTRALITY.

                             GORGE/ANGIE
                  You know, just hanging out.
                      (beat)
                  Looking to meet people.

     A CLOSE-UP of LIPS to match GORGE'S, but facing the OPPOSITE
     DIRECTION. An extremely butch, masculine FEMALE; trace of a
     mustache.

                         DALE
               You met me.

                   (echoing)
               You met me.

     ANGIE laughs, a beat LATE. Across the street a WOMAN has
     hiked up her skirt, squatted down and is TAKING A PEE on the
     sidewalk.

                            GORGE/ANGIE
               I'm Nika.

                         DALE/GUY
               I'm Dale.
                   (looks her up and down)
               I like your fur.

                         GORGE/ANGIE
               Do you want to go somewhere?

     She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time.

                         DALE/GUY
               We are somewhere.

     He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They
     start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS
     UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the
     other.

     He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the
     base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her;
     SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders...

     ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nearby
     building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has
     switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured
     prominently.

     She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involuntary
     MOAN that is more like a whimper...

                         DALE/GUY (cont'd)
               Thanks for vagina.

     We get our first wider view of the room. Much more cramped
     than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated by a
     GIANT VIDEO SCREEN, but just the front wall... there are
     other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various
     spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR all
     over the floor.

     GORGE - late 30s, MORBIDLY OBESE - is contained by a massive
     automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals.

     The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOING
     FUCKING BALLISTIC, throwing shit at it and gesturing crazily
     to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying to
     get the image back. It's NOT HAPPENING.

     The TV REPORT continues on screen, where a NEWS HOST is
     backed by a graphic showing the "society is rape" screen with
     footage of exaggeratedly CONFUSED, FRUSTRATED PLAYERS -
     they're like the actors in INFOMERCIALS who can't manage to

                  over three hours while Castle techs

     SOUND: SLUUURRRRRRRP.

     CASTLE is cruising downhill in a 360 degree THREE-DIMENSIONAL
     ENVIRONMENT that looks ABSOLUTELY REAL - except that he is on
     a STATIONARY BIKE, and the NEWS REPORT is floating in the air
     as a 3D WINDOW. He is wearing skintight Tour de France-style
     gear and SLURPING A SMOOTHIE, one hand on the handlebar, the
     other holding the cup.

     He rips into his BRAIN STEM with a tiny piece of busted
     RAZOR, hoping to pull out a chip, a wire, anything. He pulls
     out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor
     - FRIED POTATOES. He lands on a couple of dumbbells, his
     head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord SEVERED.

     KABLE looks on, impassive, emotion internalized.       GUARDS push
     through.

                            GUARD
                  What the hell happened to this one?

     An old black dude - LIFER - answers.

                            LIFER
                  Look like he escaped.

                  Back to your Jazzercise, girls...

     Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking
     sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it would
     look exactly like HACKMAN.

     HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in his
     ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to
     eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.

                              KABLE

     Now HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up
     behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD
     gestures him to follow.

                            HISPANIC GUARD (O.C.)
               Hey Kable.

     KABLE turns to look.

                         HISPANIC GUARD (cont'd)
               Let's go. Upgrades.

63   EXT. PRISON, TRAINING RANGE    - NIGHT                        63

     KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a
     massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically
     projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other
     PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot.

     KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his
     weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET...

     We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of
     target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and
     several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This
     thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out
     VICINITIES.

                            HISPANIC GUARD
               Who aims?

                         KABLE
                   (caught off guard)
               What?

                         HISPANIC GUARD
               Who aims... the slayer? Or the
               player?

     KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other
     PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN.

                         KABLE
               Not much to aiming... it's just
               hand/eye coordination. I'm the
               hand... someone, somewhere else is
               the eye.

                         HISPANIC GUARD
               That's tripped.

     KABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him
     feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being
     grateful for the human interaction.

                             KABLE
                  Sometimes... they take over - you
                  know, completely. They move you.
                  Like a robot.
                      (beat)
                  But it doesn't work so good... that
                  part's just for show. You can't
                  really fight that way.

                            HISPANIC GUARD
                  Why?

                            KABLE
                  There's a delay...

                            HISPANIC GUARD
                  Yeah, the ping... they talk about
                  that. The time it takes the slayer
                  to respond to the command... it's
                  like, five millisecond ping, eight
                  millisecond ping...

     KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN.

                            KABLE
                  Whatever you call it. A slice of a
                  second is the difference between
                  living and dying out there. When
                  the trigger pulls -

     He pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK.

                            KABLE (cont'd)
                  It's just me.

64   INT. PRISON LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT                                   64

     KABLE is ALONE, toweling off - privilege of being a TOP
     SLAYER.

     We see now   the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in
     dark, ugly   BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has
     absorbed -   including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE
     AND YELLOW   from the most recent session.

     From down the row of lockers, a WHISPER:

                            HACKMAN
                  Hey. Kable.


                                                           (CONTINUED)

     KABLE turns to look. HACKMAN'S head is POKED OUT sideways
     from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away.

                            KABLE
                  Not interested.

                            HACKMAN
                  No. Wait. Look.

     He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are
     SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD.

                            HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I just deleted someone.

     HACKMAN is almost GIGGLING, high on it.

                            HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  This is the blood. Look.

     HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; he
     nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to call
     the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement.

                            HACKMAN (cont'd)
                  He's back here. Want to see?

                            KABLE
                  Your head ain't on straight.

     HACKMAN cracks his neck. Maybe not. KABLE pulls on his
     PRISON GREYS quickly, refusing to make EYE CONTACT.

                            HACKMAN
                  I'm going to delete you too. On
                  Sunday.

                            KABLE
                  Yeah, probably.

                            HACKMAN
                  That's why they put me here.

     KABLE'S eyes narrow - What?

     HACKMAN disappears; he starts to move along an ADJACENT ROW
     OF LOCKERS, slamming the doors - SINGING fucking PINOCCHIO:

                            HACKMAN (cont'd)
                  I've got no strings... So I have
                  fun... I'm not tied up to anyone...
                  They've got strings
                  But you can see
                  There are no strings on me...

     KABLE tenses up, ready for INSTANT VIOLENCE.

                          HACKMAN (cont'd)
                You got two whores, Kable...

     If he didn't have KABLE'S attention before, THIS GOT IT.

                          KABLE
                - the fuck did you say?

                          HACKMAN
                On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I
                meant your pretty girls... You want
                to get back to them but I'm going
                to visit them first...

     KABLE is instantly ALL BUSINESS - he's going to make HACKMAN
     disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW...

     He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE
     SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another...
     another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

     NOWHERE.

     KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hinges.

                                                         TRANSITION TO:

65   INT. CASTLE ESTATE - TIME INDETERMINATE                               65

     The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives and
     spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three
     dimensions.

                          CASTLE
                He's so perfect.

     Snap out to reveal CASTLE in a dark lounge; the walls and
     ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the
     dimensions of the room. Minimalist, expensive looking
     furniture is scattered around. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE
     ROOM.

     CASTLE is standing, bare feet on white shag carpet. He is
     manipulating the image of HACKMAN in the air by pulling,
     squeezing, twisting with his hands - the interface is similar
     to the one in SIMON'S room.

     CASTLE is as pumped as a kid on Christmas morning. Then, from
     behind him:

                          CASTLE 2
                He's scary.

     We see that a perfect double of CASTLE himself has appeared
     in the room behind him.

                              CASTLE
                  Yeah...

     He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view -
     then turns to face his DOUBLE...

                             CASTLE (cont'd)
                      (proudly)
                  The new face of Slayers. Pure
                  crystallized horror, two stories
                  tall and covered in bloody red...
                      (beat)
                  He's so what they want.

                            CASTLE 2
                      (playing dumb)
                  But they love Kable.

     Another CASTLE appears to CASTLE'S left.

                            CASTLE 3
                  He's right.

     CASTLE faces them.

                            CASTLE
                      (unaffected)
                  They do now. But when my boy kills
                  their hero right there in front of
                  their eyeballs, so vivid it's like
                  you can reach out and feel the wet
                  flesh - Trust me, they'll change
                  their point of view.

                            CASTLE 2
                  How can you be sure?

                            CASTLE
                  It's human nature. They'll be
                  seduced by the power, the
                  violence... the dominance...

                            CASTLE 3
                      (shaking his head)
                  Guess we never figured on Kable
                  blowing up as big as he did.

               Bigger than the game? No. Then
               again, who ever would've imagined a
               player could last over a dozen
               sessions with the same I-con...

               Tillman is a perfect soldier, a
               tactical killing computer - you
               dropped him in with common
               murderers. What did you expect?

               And in the hands of a talented
               player...

                         CASTLE 3
               Of course we can never let him out.
               Not after what we did to him.

                         CASTLE 2
               Tell me again why we don't just get
               rid of the problem...
                   (makes a throat slashing
                    motion)
               You know, off camera?

     CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2.

                         CASTLE
               YOU - lack a flair for marketing.
               The people would never accept that.
               They need to SEE their gladiators
               brought down.

                         CASTLE 3
               One thing I know is what makes
               people tick.

     Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera
     around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He
     stares into the void, calm and utterly in control.

     The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK...

     KABLE is SPRINTING down the TUNNEL towards DAYLIGHT.          The
     VOICE comes from the rear surrounds:

               Kable, dude. It's me.

     KABLE finishes the POP-LOCK - it's goofy.

     A SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in
     the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and
     scrambles for better cover.

                            KABLE
                  No. Pay attention to the game.

     They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of
     BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets
     there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT
     SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN.

     Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE,
     TRIANGULATING.

     KABLE ROLLS - BIG AMMO displacing the air just inches above
     his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONED
     CAR behind him - switches TURRETS and comes up FIRING...
     armor-piercing shells: BOOM. BOOM.

     A 180 spin... BOOM.      MINUS three BLUES.

     In QUICK CUTS we see SIMON striking BADASS poses; on the 3D
     screen KABLE ECHOES THEM - it's like a SYNCHRONIZED DANCE.

                                                             CUT TO:

74   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS                            74

     KABLE keeps moving - he passes a BLUE, on his knees in the
     mud; The BLUE has completely LOST HIS SHIT.

                            BLUE SOLDIER 4
                  This is real, this is real, this is
                  real!!!!

     KABLE doesn't bother to shoot him; he's UNARMED. But...

     SHHHTUNK. A 50 CALIBER SHELL connects from somewhere distant
     and the BLUE is VAPORIZED, a smear on the pavement.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  That was sick.

                            KABLE
                  Wait a minute... are you twelve?

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  I'm nineteen.

                            KABLE
                  Bullshit. This is unbelievable.
                  How am I not dead yet?

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.

     KABLE doesn't even register this. His darting eyes pick up a
     familiar face in the chaos: FREEK.

     FREEK has apparently volunteered as a generi-con - he is
     dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he
     walks across the street.

                            FREEK
                      (mumbling)
                  Gotta keep my holes down... keep
                  `em down. Freek's gonna make it,
                  gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna
                  burn this joint...

     It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREEK
     and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes
     off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire -
     the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do.

     An explosion nearby pushes them forward.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Gibs.

                            KABLE
                  What?

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits.
                  Chunks. Pieces.

               Death row psychos, so what?          They
               had it coming.

     An exposed concrete stairwell leads into the bowels of a
     collapsed building; it looks like it must've gotten the
     OKLAHOMA CITY treatment in the early 2000s.

75   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING - STAIRWELL                             75

     But there's still juice feeding the dim FLUORESCENTS... KABLE
     makes his way DOWN. A distant voyeur's POV - maybe a
     sniper's telescopic sight? - observes KABLE disappearing
     underground.

                         KABLE
               Guess that goes for me too.

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Yeah, but you're different.

                         KABLE
               Different how?

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY
               psycho.

76   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - CONTINUOUS                      76

     He emerges in an UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL. Forty or fifty
     cars and SUVs, 2000-2009, lie dormant, covered in dirt,
     dust, and debris. KABLE switches on a LIGHT built in to his
     weapon.

     The FLY CAM scans 360 degrees, independent of KABLE, giving
     them two sets of eyes.

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Damn, new area.

     KABLE nods toward an EXIT at the opposite end, marked P-4.

                           KABLE
               That way.

     They make for it.

                  Think about it, Kable: all the shit
                  we've been through together. What
                  an epic run.
                      (beat)
                  It's going to suck to see it end.

                            KABLE
                  Are you kidding me?

                  Well, yeah - I get that for you
                  it's different.

77   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #3/NEAR RESTRICTED AREA - MOMENTS      77
     LATER

     KABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a
     narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat.
     Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks
     down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL
     STRIPES and a warning: RESTRICTED.

                            KABLE
                  We should go that way.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  There's nothing there.

                            KABLE
                  Kid, trust me - I was going house
                  to house in Tehran while you were
                  still sucking mommy's nipple.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                      (sarcastic)
                  Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the
                  visual, but it's a restricted area.
                  It's beyond the borders of the
                  game. I couldn't put you there if I
                  tried.

     KABLE just grunts; his eyes steal a last look down the block.
     They head the other way...

     THOOM.

     CLOSE RANGE: a big ass armor piercing MORTAR SHELL PASSES IN
     FRONT OF KABLE'S FACE...

     Time STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air an
     inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple from
     the displaced air...

     then, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it
     whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building.

     KABLE is running.

78   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3 - CRUSHED RIOT VAN                              78

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  ... shit shit shit!

     He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the
     direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact
     still raining down... and then:

     From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of
     IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN.

     HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S
     hand; it skitters across the concrete.

     SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no
     time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every
     move pings a step late...

     KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is
     moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control.

     HACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING
     HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty,
     high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points
     the barrel at his    FACE.

                             HACKMAN
                      (friendly)
                  Bye Kable.

     He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER...

     The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP.

     The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down-
     cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and
     plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD.

                            HACKMAN (cont'd)
                  What happened?

     dudes look at him and back away... when he turns toward us we
     see why: half his head, shoulder and one arm are blown off...

80   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #3/CRUSHED RIOT VAN - SIMULTANEOUS 80

     KABLE seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into HACKMAN'S
     BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pretzel
     and throws him off.

                            KABLE

                  Hey.

     KABLE sees GUARDS appearing and BLUES hurrying away from
     ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the
     mortar... session complete.

     KABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and
     speaks directly into SIMON'S ear:

                            KABLE
                  Listen to me. I don't know who's
                  behind it, or why, but I was
                  supposed to die today. They're
                  gunning for us. I can beat them,
                  but not with you controlling me.

                            SIMON
                  What the hell...?

     This is unthinkable, dangerous talk.

                            KABLE
                  Turn me loose, kid.        You want to
                  win, turn me loose.

                            KABLE
                  Find a way.

     A drab brownstone apartment.

     Shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight; the
     interior is mute, faded - claustrophobic. KABLE has his cell;
     even though ANGIE is on the outside, and free, her
     environment seems to parallel his.

     A worn-out photo is taped to the fridge: the same little girl

     She stands in front of a closet mirror in the bedroom,
     looking herself over. She's FULLY DRESSED... but not like we
     saw her in society. Conservative. Pretty. NORMAL. She
     rehearses a friendly smile, but has difficulty not breaking
     into tears.

     ANIMATED, COLORED LIGHT leaks in from outside through the
     dark window blinds behind her - some sort of projected
     advertising?

     CUT TO: same room, later. ANGIE sits on the unmade bed. She
     searches through her purse for a PILL JAR, rattles a few into
     her hand... she DRY SWALLOWS them... leans forward, eyes
     shut, struggling NOT TO PASS OUT... she has to pull herself
     together somehow... the CAMERA pushes past her, toward the
     window, where the ANIMATED COLORS play 24-7...

     An ad for slayers is running - KABLE, in cinematic slo-mo,

85   INT. SOCIAL SERVICES INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY                      85

     ANGIE sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair; the light
     is flat, fluorescent... in front of her, behind a desk, is a
     no-nonsense Social Services CASEWORKER, late 30s, CUBAN.

                         CASEWORKER
                   (looks over her paperwork)
               So... Miss Roth.

     ANGIE delivers the smile we saw her rehearse with all the
     warmth she can muster; it's not convincing.

                         CASEWORKER (cont'd)
               Why are we here today... says you'd
               like to apply for custody of your
               child-

                          ANGIE
               Delia.   Her name is Delia.

     The CASEWORKER looks over the paperwork while ANGIE shifts in
     her seat... torture.

                         CASEWORKER
               Spouse incarcerated, life without
               possibility of parole. You use
               your maiden name.

                         ANGIE
               My husband - he... it's not
               entirely true, regarding his
               sentence. In fact, he's due to be
               released soon...

     She makes brief eye contact with ANGIE.

                         CASEWORKER
               Your husband was charged and
               convicted of first degree murder,
               Miss Roth. I can hardly consider
               his release, if it was to occur, to
               be a positive.

     This is not going well. ANGIE holds her tongue with all of
     her will, not wanting to make it worse. The CASEWORKER holds
     all the cards.

                         CASEWORKER (cont'd)

     ANGIE is hanging on... be pleasant, be friendly, breathe...
     but INSIDE she wants to cry, to scream, to fucking EXPLODE.

     a thing she can say.

86   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                        86

     SIMON is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling - a GIANT
     VIDEO SCREEN playing back key moments of that day's Slayers
     session in an endless loop. SIMON holds his fingers up in
     front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with
     little fluid movements of his hands.

     Suddenly the screen GLITCHES OUT, goes dead for a second -
     and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a
     GIANT FACE, surrounded by black, STARING DOWN AT HIM:

     HUMANZ BROTHER, early 30's; a savvy leader with an
     unforgettable presence.

     His style is a throwback to another era; like a 70s Black
     Panther Soul Brother transplanted into the high tech future.

     SIMON puts it all together.

                  No shit... you're the guy from TV.

                            HUMANZ BROTHER
                  That's right, baby. You think
                  about what the brotha said?

                            SIMON
                  To what, um, brotha do you refer...
                  brotha?

                            HUMANZ BROTHER
                  Kable wants the freedom to ass-
                  kick. Do shit his way. You gonna
                  give it to him?

                            SIMON
                  You were listening.

                            HUMANZ BROTHER
                  We see and hear everything that
                  goes on inside the so-called game.

                             SIMON
                  Alright, then.
                      (considering)
                  Kable said we got lucky - that they
                  were gunning for us - what was that
                  all about?

                            HUMANZ BROTHER
                  Kable got a past... he knows
                  things. Things he don't even know
                  he know.

                             SIMON
                  Huh?   What things?

               handle my bidness.

     HUMANZ BROTHER just shakes his head.

                         HUMANZ BROTHER
               You're not hearing me - this is not
               something you can control. They
               gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the

               You just another poor little rich
               honky. No Kable, no pussy, no

     SIMON can't help but consider it, mind reeling. It's obvious
     KABLE would royally fucking dominate, but... SIMON shakes it
     off.

                         SIMON
               That... would be cheating.

     KABLE looks up. It's the SAME VOICE as before - the one that

                               KABLE

                  Listen to me: Simon's going to give
                  you what you want. What you asked
                  him for.

                            KABLE
                  How do you know that?

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  I know something else: whether or
                  not he's controlling you, you will
                  never reach the save point. Castle
                  won't allow it.

                               KABLE
                  We'll see.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  No. Listen to me, Tillman - the
                  game is unwinnable - they will not
                  let you live. If you're want to
                  get out and see the people in the

     KABLE doesn't answer; he absorbs her words, wondering if he
     can believe them... finally:

     BLACK.

     Overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life, revealing a
     CLAUSTROPHOBIC ROOM - four walls, metal grating underfoot -
     and A LOCKER. KABLE is in his COMBAT BROWN.

     He PRINT ACTIVATES the locker. The WEAPON is there... and
     something else: a wrinkled BROWN PAPER BAG. What the hell?
     He takes it out, trying not to glance too obviously at the
     overhead SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CUT TO the POV from the CAM: KABLE is opening the bag...

                         VOICE (O.C.)
               What's he got there?

     BACK in the room. Inside the brown bag is a FIFTH OF VODKA.
     KABLE quickly slips it into his side cargo-pocket.

                         VOICE (cont'd)
               Kable, what the hell is that?!

     Behind KABLE a DOOR SLIDES OPEN automatically, revealing a
     CONCRETE TUNNEL, like the PLAYERS' entrance to a FOOTBALL
     STADIUM... the WHITE LIGHT is BLINKING ON and OFF... SOLDIERS
     sprint for the daylight, trying to escape the TORTURE... it's
     CHAOS.

               from your pants and discard into

     ALL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS POINT AT KABLE. KABLE - no choice -
     makes the decision, twists the cap, tilts his head back, and
     SLAMS THE ENTIRE BOTTLE.

     He wails the BOTTLE at one of the CAMERAS, shattering it -
     and joins the others rushing into combat.

     KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND

     ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the

                  YOU happened, jackass. You wanted
                  control, you got it.

     KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID
     WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA,
     which is kicking in INSTANTLY...

                               KABLE
                  No shit...

                             SIMON (O.S.)
                  Yeah, that's right. So please don't
                  fuck up...

     An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING,
     DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD...

91   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                       91

     He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from
     reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his
     vision doubles and bleeds...

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  What's the matter with you Kable?
                  Kill something!

     BLUES. Lots of them.        KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING
     NOTHING.

                  This is unbelievable.

92   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                        92

     KABLE is running erratically at least... hard to HIT... but
     definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE.

     A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet;
     the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting
     air...

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                      (frustrated)
                  Fuck it.

     We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER...

     KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the
     SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down
     on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss
     cheese.

     Too close.

                            SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
                      (the voice of reason)
                  Kable. Listen: it's the last game.
                  You're going to be dead and I'm
                  going to look like a total asshole
                  if you don't pull your balls
                  together!

                               KABLE
                  Blow me.

     He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the
     UNDERGROUND GARAGE.

                               SIMON (O.S.)
                  Dammit!

93   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER                      93

     KABLE slams open a door marked P4 and stumbles into the CAR
     GRAVEYARD...

     Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of
     a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT,
     NO GOOD... he stumbles to the next, then another...
     another... his head hits a passenger side window,
     SPIDERWEBBING IT...

     FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY,
     PRISTINE.

     Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for
     FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model,
     which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as
     BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass
     wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH
     A BUILDING OR TWO.

     KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED
     under the cap is a prominent WARNING:

                                  Ethanol Only

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Kable. Dude. What are you doing?

     KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat.

     Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on
     the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK.

                            SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  What the hell?

     He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the
     feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down
     the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE
     brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT
     LOOKING. His head is clearing.

     KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE
     TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless.

     KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's
     regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S
     SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A
     BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE
     IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK...

     BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole
     into the dashboard.

     KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HACKMAN and six
     other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast.

                            SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  GO, GO, GO!

                            KABLE
                  Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin
                  cheerleader?


                                                                    (CONTINUED)

     VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again,
     knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!!

     He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT.

     HACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points
     50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant
     KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up -

     BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the
     truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and
     launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars.

     HACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the
     garage, disintegrating a concrete column.

                         HACKMAN
               Fuuuuck!!!!

     He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving
     it in.

94   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING) - MOMENTS LATER      94

     KABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires
     shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and
     TAKES OFF...

     He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA.

95   INT/EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING)                  95

     The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the
     truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING
     GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture -
     now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA
     forward, next to the driver's window...

     The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a
     mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head.

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Kable, PLEASE... get back in the
               game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS,
               KABLE!!!

     KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the
     window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way,
     barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the
     window of a building. Bye, FLY.

                                                        CUT TO:

      SIMON'S screen is filled with a GLITCHED OUT view of NOTHING,
      under a pile of glass and concrete.

                          SIMON
                Um.

97    EXT. SLAYERS RESTRICTED AREA - CONTINUOUS                       97

      The SUBMARINE ALARM is sounding across the BATTLEGROUND.
      KABLE is heading deep into RESTRICTED TERRITORY, slamming
      through and swerving around obstacles.

98    INT/EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                         98

      WITHOUT WARNING: a SNOWPLOW comes blasting out of nowhere
      going 80, trying to ram the driver's side... it's a tick
      late, clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a
      SPIN... KABLE is knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over
      the passenger seat. He recovers, straightens out and keeps
      going.

                          KABLE
                    (relieved)
                Ughh, that was the one.

99    INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                99

      SIMON is switching from CAMERA to CAMERA, trying to pick up a
      view of KABLE... finally he comes across a RUMBLING CHASE
      CAM, coming up on KABLE'S truck from behind...

100   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING) - SIMULTANEOUS              100

      The CAMERA is mounted on a SNOWPLOW, one of a pair gaining on
      KABLE, slamming through rubble and debris.

101   INT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                             101

      KABLE spots them in the REAR VIEW MIRROR.

      He SLAMS HIS HEAD against the steering wheel to clear it -
      despite the purge he's still pretty FUCKED UP.

      KABLE pops the driver's door and leans out, GETTING A BEAD on
      the nearest PLOW...

102   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  102

      A shell comes RIGHT AT US - the screen GLITCHES, FREEZES -
      and goes BLACK.

      hemorrhaging black smoke; then SLAMS into the SECOND, sending
      it into the side of a building.

      KABLE'S TRUCK HICCUPS - FUEL is on EMPTY, but still charging

105   INT/EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                                 105

      A LOW CONCRETE WALL surrounds the perimeter, and it's COMING
      UP FAST; beyond it: more abandoned urban wasteland.

      KABLE has got too much speed at this point to do anything but
      slam the thing SIDEWAYS into a SICK POWER SLIDE - the TRUCK
      hits the barrier and FLIPS OVER IT, CORKSCREWING four times
      before GRINDING TO A STOP on it's hood. The AIRBAGS DEPLOY,
      smashing KABLE into his seat...

106   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA - SUBWAY ENTRANCE                                  106

      Behind him, two SMART MISSILES are streaking high across the
      grey sky... they change direction and DOUBLE THEIR SPEED -
      it's fucking HORRIFIC... and CONVERGE on the downed TRUCK in
      an EYEBLINK.

      BOOM.

108   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA - SUBWAY ENTRANCE                                  108

      KABLE is LIFTED OFF HIS FEET and blown into the SUBWAY
      ENTRANCE, which COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK.

      the train to the slayers battleground - except the population
      here is strictly civilian: young, eccentric, mostly
      attractive, but their eyes are burned out, dead... lost.
      Dishwater daylight filters through the windows.

      The news broadcast continues, fed over video monitors that

      GRAFFITI on concrete, stenciled:

                          slayers is bad tv - humanz

      KABLE is standing across the street from a BEAT DOWN
      BROWNSTONE, watching the second floor window.

      A funky OFF-ROAD MOTOCROSS BIKE buzzes by him and up onto the
      sidewalk, FARTING SMOKE. KABLE IGNORES the RIDER, who parks,
      gets off, loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side.

                             TRACE
                   She's not home.

      KABLE turns - the RIDER is a green-eyed 22 year-old girl w/
      black rimmed WEEZER glasses; SMART AND CUTE as hell... this
      is TRACE.

                              TRACE (cont'd)
                   But Castle's personal security will
                   be, soon enough - trust me, you
                   don't want to meet them.
                       (beat)
                   You know, it's pretty obvious that
                   you'd come here first.

                             KABLE
                   Who are you?

      TRACE smiles.

                             TRACE
                   You asked me that once before.

                             KABLE
                   Your voice...

      We might recognize it too - it's the VOICE from the other
      side of the CELL DOOR.

                             TRACE
                   You should really come with me...

      She glances skyward toward the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS.

                             TRACE (cont'd)
                   ... like, NOW.

      KABLE considers his options...

      They TAKE OFF on the MOTO, TRACE driving.

113   EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - DAY                                      113

      TRACE darts nimbly thru traffic and pedestrians, finally
      ZAGGING up onto the sidewalk and down a side alley...

114   EXT. ALLEY - ADULT STORE ENTRANCE                                   114

      There's an open doorway to the left - NEON SIGN above:

      She CUTS HARD 90 degrees, straight into it, leaving tread on
      the concrete - through hanging black rubber strip curtains...

115   INT. ADULT STORE - NARROW STAIRWELL                                 115

      and STRAIGHT DOWN A NARROW STAIRWELL, taking the stairs
      MOTOCROSS...

      She cuts HARD RIGHT at the bottom...

116   INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR                                               116

      ...down a concrete corridor and onto a minimal FREIGHT
      ELEVATOR - open on the sides... punches the down button, BIKE
      still idling... KABLE coughs from the fumes...

      Halfway down there is a SQUARE OPENING in the wall of the
      elevator shaft - a TUNNEL TO BLACK.

                                TRACE
                   Hang on.

      TRACE REVS up the bike - and as they pass the tunnel, she
      POPS IT. They're GONE.

117   INT. HUMANZ HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER                             117

      A DARK, underground VIDEO ARCADE... low ceilings, concrete;
      OLD SCHOOL - sort of a graveyard of lost games... the
      classics of the 80s - MISSILE COMMAND, DEFENDER, ROBOTRON,
      CRANK, etc. The dimensions of the room are impossible to
      determine. A dozen or so PEOPLE - just BLACK SILHOUETTES in
      the CATHODE RAY GLOW - are scattered around, banging buttons,
      giving it body english, racking up scores.

      TRACE leads KABLE through, toward the one BRIGHTLY LIT SPOT:
      at the center of the arcade, an AIR HOCKEY table is blasted
      with WHITE LIGHT from above. HUMANZ BROTHER, who we
      recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid 20s,
      long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK,
      CLACK...

      They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear
      to notice KABLE.

      HUMANZ BROTHER smacks a random 3-bank           WINNER.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   You a fool.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Stop playing that freaky shit off
                   the rail.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   It's a game of deception.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Whatever, that's cuz you got no
                   power...

      HUMANZ DUDE measures a shot, rolling the paddle with one
      finger - then LETS IT RIP - slamming the GAME WINNER in a
      STRAIGHT LINE past HUMANZ BROTHER'S frozen paddle - SCORE: 7-
      5.

                              HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)
                       (getting in his face)
                   Huh? What?

                               HUMANZ BROTHER
                   Bullshit.

                             KABLE
                   You guys suck.

      They turn, suddenly aware of him. HUMANZ DUDE'S paddle hand
      goes limp; the puck limps in and scores, meaninglessly.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                       (impressed)
                   Kable. Holy shit.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   His name's Tillman.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Whatever.
                       (to KABLE)
                   You made it. You're really here.

      KABLE looks them over - he's not sure what he expected, but
      it wasn't this.

                             KABLE
                   You're the ones who broke me out?

                   We only freed your mind.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   Your ass followed.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Hey, Kable...

      DUDE seems to be the most affected by KABLE'S presence -
      BROTHER is calm, in the moment; TRACE is focused, all
      business... DUDE is pure FANBOY.

                             HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)
                   You're... great.

      HUMANZ BROTHER gives HUMANZ DUDE a look and shakes his head.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                       (to Kable)
                   You got questions.

                              KABLE
                   A few.

      He glances over at TRACE.

                             KABLE (cont'd)
                   She took my blood. Why?

                          HUMANZ DUDE
                Because Castle's scared of you.

                          HUMANZ BROTHER
                It ain't just a game, you know,
                Tillman. Everyday there's more
                people steppin forward, wanna be a
                part of Castle's world. Throwing
                away everything it means to be
                human.

                          TRACE
                Right now it's the desperate
                ones... convicts, addicts... the

                system is growing out of control,
                set to bankrupt the whole damn
                USA... Castle rides in on a white
                horse, says he got a plan to bail
                us out and everyone just fall in
                line.

                          TRACE
                So what's next? The health care
                system is collapsing - Castle comes
                to the rescue again...

                          HUMANZ BROTHER
                This time he's pushin total control
                of genetic disease... birth defects
                a thing of the past... all we gotta

118   INT. FBI INTERROGATION - TIME INDETERMINATE                         118

      SIMON is in a stark interrogation room, alone, drumming his
      fingers on the table - thumb-to-pinky, pinky-to-thumb. Trying
      not to show how scared he is.

      The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We only
      see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup.

      The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to
      SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he can
      manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being
      interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls.

      When AGENT KEITH speaks, he is calm, conversational.

                          AGENT KEITH
                Guess you remember that day.

      SIMON nods, noncommitally.

      fingers in the camera's face, throwing the motion control
      hand signal for FIRE and KILL... in another, he's being
      mobbed at an event, signing an amazing pair of breasts with a
      black marker.

                   Good times.

                   Sure. On the outside.        Now look at
                   these.

      A new series of graphic photos show bloody, mangled remains -
      the aftermath of a slayers session.

                   Wonder how long you'd last on the
                   other side of the screen.

      This SITS IN THE ROOM for a BEAT - SIMON considers several
      responses, chooses NONE OF THEM.

                   Simon, you're being held today
                   suspected of aiding in the escape
                   of a convicted murderer from a
                   maximum security penitentiary. The

                   detail...

      SIMON FLINCHES at this one.

                In addition, your father's bank
                accounts have been frozen pending
                further investigation - naturally,
                seeing it was his money that
                essentially funded Mr. Tillman's
                escape.
                    (beat)
                I'm going to need you to tell me
                everything that happened leading up
                to yesterday afternoon. Everyone
                you talked to, everything you
                heard, everything you did. I need
                you to do that... right now.

                          SIMON
                Yeah, um... I need something too.

                    (ice cold)
                Do you now? And what might that be?

      SIMON swallows hard.

                          SIMON
                Could you dudes do a sandwich like:
                peanut butter, almond butter,
                walnut butter... pecan butter,
                pistachio butter... pretty much any
                kind of, you know, nut butter. And
                Welch's grape.

      Dead silence. SIMON chews a HANGING CHAD off of a FINGERNAIL.

                          AGENT KEITH
                Pistachio. They make that?

                It's awesome.

      FAT FINGERS squeeze air.

      ANGIE, in a white tank top and panties, is pulled to 3-D LIFE-
      SIZE DIMENSIONS on GORGE'S video wall, standing impassively
      in space.

      A FAT TONGUE wets FAT LIPS.

      GORGE scrolls through options... hair, clothes, makeup...
      from slutty to sci-fi to quirky to casual, and back to
      slutty... as he SELECTS OPTIONS they appear on ANGIE,
      ROTATING HER in three dimensions to model; she's a living,
      breathing BARBIE DOLL.

      ORANGE SHERBET HAIR, then a PLATINUM WHITE Judy JETSON
      PONYTAIL... black CAT-SUIT, DAISY DUKE, Darryl Hannah's PUNK
      REPLICANT from Blade Runner... he chooses a LOOK and LOCKS IT

      GORGE lifts an OXYGEN MASK to his face and breathes deep...
      he GOES LIMP in his chair - eyes rolled up in his head, head
      clocked back to face the ceiling... bathed in sweat... the

      ANGIE is on the sidewalk, a little unsteady on high heels -
      wearing the outfit GORGE CHOSE.

      OTHER PEOPLE are wandering around everywhere. A DEBUTANTE-
      type in a pink ensemble has a poofy SHITZU on a leash; the
      SHITZU is PISSING ON IT'S OWNER'S LEG, but she doesn't seem
      to notice. A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in the
      back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking.

      She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go,
      without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH?

      ANGIE walks around the corner to a BAR and goes in.

121   INT. THORAX BAR - CONTINUOUS                                            121

      The THORAX BAR is small, intimate, but ULTRA-STYLED... the
      theme is insect. All manner of exotic bug preserved in
      glass, suspended in ice... one wall is a giant, black-lit ANT
      FARM... green, glowing FIREFLIES dart through the air...
      people lounge on plush seating, gobbling up creatively
      prepared bug delicacies - FRIED PINK GRASSHOPPERS, fat yellow
      GRUBS with red chili oil...

      ANGIE takes a seat at the BAR.

                                BARTENDER
                   The usual?

      She just WINKS, flirtatious.

      The BARTENDER returns a smile and shakes up an AQUA BLUE
      MARTINI... to finish, he plops in a LIVE, WHITE LARVA...


                                                                  (CONTINUED)

      it curls and twists in the liquid, soaking the alcohol into
      it's pulp...

      She takes a SIP, letting the LARVA curl around her tongue...
      swallows it down... as a GUY takes a seat to her left - his
      hair is shiny, slick black licorice.

                                RICK RAPE
                   Hi Nika.

                             ANGIE
                   Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?

      In GORGE'S apartment his lips move, ANGIE'S echoing to match.

                             ANGIE (cont'd)
                   I thought you weren't allowed to
                   come here anymore.

      RICK RAPE laughs, throwing his head back and slapping his
      knee - EXAGGERATED.

                             RICK RAPE
                   That was just last month. I was a
                   bad boy.

      ANGIE yawns.

                             ANGIE
                   Are you still a bad boy?

122   INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY                                122

      ANGIE EXITS the ELEVATOR on the 3rd floor - a modern,
      minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind.

      They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from
      behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS
      a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it
      WHISPERS OPEN.

      ANGIE snaps a heel; they stumble in.

123   INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                                 123

      ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC
      blend of GIRLIE/GEEKY/PORN. Shafts of NICOTINE SUNLIGHT
      filter through patterned curtains.

      She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE
      follows... he licks his lips - an automatic gesture - and
      begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees,
      back to him, doesn't even bother to look, until...

                   Urkk.

      She TURNS.

      KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BARBELL
      - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. He
      brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN BAT
      - KKRRUNCH.

      ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR
      with EMOTION.

      KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... then
      falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in
      his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS.

      GORGE is paralyzed.

                             GORGE/ANGIE
                   Please don't kill me.

      ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes.     KABLE
      just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation.

                             GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd)
                   I'll do anything.

                             KABLE
                   Don't say that.

      GORGE holds out his hands; ANGIE'S fingers caress KABLE'S
      chest and move toward his crotch...

                             KABLE (cont'd)
                   Stop.

      He pushes her hands away, gently.

                             KABLE (cont'd)
                   This isn't you.

      ANGIE'S eyes WELL UP with TEARS.

                       (trying to contain his

                   controlling her... let her talk,
                   motherfucker.

      GORGE swallows; KABLE is staring straight into his eyeballs.

      KABLE buries his face in his hands; it's TEARING HIM UP.

                          GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd)
                She has to say what I tell her.

      KABLE looks deep into ANGIE'S eyes.

                           KABLE
                     (almost whispering)
                You can hear me, baby. I know you
                can.

      He WIPES AWAY A TEAR from her cheek with his thumb.     After
      all he's been through he begins to BREAK DOWN.

                          KABLE (cont'd)
                I love you... love you...

                SHUT UP!!!

      He's SCREAMING directly at GORGE, who cowers in his chair as
      if KABLE were in the room with him.

                          KABLE (cont'd)
                Say anything else and I'll find
                you... I'll rip you TO FUCKING
                PIECES, do you understand me?

      GORGE/ANGIE nods.

                          KABLE (cont'd)
                    (to ANGIE)
                I'm getting you out of here.

      KABLE pulls ANGIE out the door and down the hall, in tactical
      mode, WEAPON ready... he heads to the ELEVATOR, punches up a
      ride. No sign of trouble.

      HACKMAN is standing there with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN.

                              HACKMAN
                       (friendly)
                   Hi, Kable.

      BOOM.

      KABLE TAKES IT IN THE CHEST; he's BLOWN OFF HIS FEET, through
      a wall and into an apartment opposite the ELEVATOR.

      HACKMAN grabs ANGIE'S wrist, drags her onto the ELEVATOR and
      waits a BEAT, smiling pleasantly. The ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES.

125   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                               125

      KABLE is ON HIS BACK in rubble. His chest is a BLACK,
      SMOKING HOLE... but as the smoke clears we see that his BODY
      ARMOR has ABSORBED THE BLAST. He's groggy, in excruciating
      pain, wind knocked out of him - but ALIVE.

      TWO GUYS in GAS MASKS and RUBBER SUITS are watching him from
      the next room as he attempts to STRUGGLE TO HIS KNEES; KABLE
      has obviously interrupted something.

126   INT. ELEVATOR - SIMULTANEOUS                                       126

      HACKMAN and ANGIE are having a pleasant ride down, HACKMAN'S
      hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - still
      smoking - shoulder strapped.

                             HACKMAN
                       (to ANGIE)
                   Anybody in there?

      The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLING,
      NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE.

      HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH
      BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide with
      TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious.

      GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his
      chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he
      speaks, ANGIE echoes:

                             GORGE/ANGIE
                   Come on... do it...

      HACKMAN raises his eyebrows - he wasn't expecting that one...
      but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S
      legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.

      The GUY is confused - where'd she go? He looks to ANGIE.
      HACKMAN headlocks him from behind, and slowly - making eye
      contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK.

      ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY.

      HACKMAN lets the second body DROP, chuckling, as the ELEVATOR
      DOOR OPENS...

      KABLE is waiting.

127   INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                         127

      KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE
      ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to
      the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts
      with BLOOD.

      HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - the
      blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches;
      displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The
      BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall
      behind him, four inches deep.

      HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the
      SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move away,
      HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN
      FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes out
      a set of HACKMAN'S toes.

      KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings up
      his own WEAPON to close the deal...

      ... as the GLASS WALLS of the LOBBY EXPLODE.

      MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN.

      KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and
      breaks for the BACK EXIT.

      KABLE and ANGIE hit WHITE HOT DAYLIGHT. A BLUE SLAYER breaks
      the corner of the building and KABLE FRAGS HIM.

      KABLE grabs ANGIE by the shoulders and yells directly at

      KABLE takes out another BLUE at a distance, following close
      behind her. They run into a GENERIC, UNMARKED BUILDING...

129   INT. SOCIETY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                                129

      ... the SHOT CONTINUES, across the LOBBY, through an
      anonymous grey door...

130   INT. STAIRS/PINK CORRIDOR                                         130

      ...and down a FLIGHT OF STAIRS... MUFFLED MUSIC is THUMPING,
      getting LOUDER... down a PINK CORRIDOR and into...

131   INT. UNDERGROUND RAVE - CONTINUOUS                                131

      ... a 24 HOUR UNDERGROUND RAVE, in full effect.

      This thing is FUCKING HUGE... in the DARK it's impossible to
      tell just how big... hundreds of writhing SOCIETY DUDES,
      CHICKS and OTHER... DAY-GLO, moving spotlights, strobes...
      the BUBBLE GIRLS from CRANK make an appearance... along with
      the DISCOVERY CHANNEL SKATERS from the PARK, now in GOTHED-UP
      GEAR...

      KABLE gathers it all... he takes ANGIE'S arm and begins to
      wade through the CHAOS... the BLOOD SPATTERS on his face POP
      in sharp, inverse DAY-GLO, like HARTIGAN'S SCAR in SIN
      CITY...

      A SKATER GIRL takes a hold of the glowing, smoking barrel of
      KABLE'S WEAPON and starts to SKATE CIRCLES around him, ring-
      around-the-rosie... he wrenches it hard, sending her flying
      into a crowd that goes down like BOWLING PINS.

      They continue MOVING... KABLE happens to notice RED LASERS
      moving through the DARK... probing... RAVE LIGHTS? No...

      THOOM.   THOOM THOOM.

      LIGHTNING FLASHES, EXPLOSIONS... a RAVER nearby
      disintegrates, BLOOD and GUTS a DAY GLO VOLCANO.      DANCERS
      slip and FALL ON THEIR ASSES in the viscera.

      The SLAYERS are moving thru the RAVE, hunting. Everyone but
      KABLE and ANGIE are so out of it they don't even notice.

                             KABLE
                       (to GORGE)
                   You. Run.

      ANGIE runs.

      KABLE goes COMMANDO, evading the HUNTERS, ducking under
      EXPLODING SHIT... he moves to FLANK them...

      the DJ is DECAPITATED by a stray 50 caliber round but the
      GROOVE DON'T STOP...

      LIGHTNING STRIKES FREEZE the ACTION as KABLE engages the
      BLUES, one by one... he takes out THREE of them with CLOSE
      RANGE BLASTS and another HAND-TO-HAND-TO-HEADSNAP - then
      notices more BLUES moving in... too many...

      He catches up to ANGIE and they make for an EXIT, any EXIT...

132   INT. RAVE - LOUNGE AREA                                          132

      They find CURTAINS, run past freaky CHILL LOUNGES and SMOKE
      OUT ROOMS... KABLE blows a hole in a locked maintenance door
      and they duck out of RAVE WORLD into...

133   INT. RAVE - INDUSTRIAL CONCRETE CORRIDOR                         133

      ...an industrial CONCRETE CORRIDOR... MUFFLED BLASTS,
      SCREAMING in the REAR SURROUNDS tell KABLE the BLUES are
      close behind... up more stairs, they SLAM through a SERVICE
      DOOR and back into...

134   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY, CONTINUOUS                                   134

      ... blinding DAYLIGHT.

      A SCOOBY DOO-looking VAN pulls up to the CURB in front of
      them; the back doors SWING OPEN.

                             GINA PARKER SMITH
                   I can get you out.

      Not much choice. KABLE and ANGIE climb in. The ELECTRIC VAN
      drives quietly away, attracting no attention.

135   INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS                                            135

      KABLE slumps against the wall of the VAN, cradling ANGIE in
      his arms - exhausted. ANGIE'S eyes are POST-TRAUMATIC,
      searching.

      GINA is PUMPED.

                             GINA PARKER SMITH
                   I can't believe it's you. This

      He looks her straight in the eye.

                             KABLE (cont'd)
                   You're dead.

      GINA pales. He's not lying.

      CLOSE-UP: a LANCET is prepared... it PUNCTURES SKIN and
      SUCKS.

      ANGIE is lying on a      black leather couch, unconscious -
      breathing deeply...      TRACE pops the LANCET out of ANGIE'S
      fingertip and plops      a RED DROP into a glass tube of liquid.
      KABLE kneels beside      ANGIE, stroking her hair.

      HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are all
      there.

                               KABLE

                   soup, light it up, extract it -
                   then feed my girl's sequence into

                             GINA PARKER SMITH
                       (thinking out loud)
                   It's an anti-spyware program.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Basically. We can't quarantine the
                   foreign cells per se but we can
                   disable their ability to transmit
                   and receive.

      GINA'S not buying this I.T. GUY shit.

                             GINA PARKER SMITH
                   Fuck that. I'd make you cut it out
                   of me.

      TRACE gives her a glance: dumb bitch.

                             TRACE
                   That would be like cutting out part

                   Ken Castle made his first billion
                   designing virtual reality
                   simulators for the US military.
                   Six years ago he brought them
                   something new - a breakthrough so
                   profound, he said, that history
                   would be divided up between
                   everything before and everything
                   that came after.

                   They tested it on soldiers... the
                   first volunteer was Corporal Travis
                   Scotch - a friend of yours, I
                   believe.

      They stop.

                             KABLE
                   Yeah. He was.

                   The second was you.

                   never break down, never

                   Nine weeks later Scotch was dead
                   and you were serving life in
                   maximum. Castle's project was shut
                   down... but the shit wasn't a total
                   loss: the same technology
                   resurfaced within a year... in a
                   game. Castle called it society.

                             KABLE
                   Thank you for the history lesson.

      HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are
      watching the image on a LO-FI computer monitor. HUMANZ DUDE
      runs his fingers along a touchpad, MOVING FREQUENCIES around
      on a WAVEFORM MONITOR, trying to dial the picture in better.

      We see KABLE through an OBSERVATION WINDOW, slumped over in a
      chair... DREAMING? Or just CONCENTRATING?

                             GINA PARKER SMITH
                   What are we looking at?

                   I read something about this. But
                   that tech is supposed to be a
                   decade away...

      HUMANZ DUDE smirks, shakes his head.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Current exponential rate of growth,
                   I can't imagine a piece of tech
                   that will take that long to come
                   around.

      KABLE - younger, in UNIFORM - walks down a sterile corridor.
      He is dead calm, emotionless.

      Tiny SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS track his movements.            He comes to a
      DOOR; it whispers open and he STEPS IN.

142   INT. MILITARY FACILITY, DEBRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    142

      A WHITE, MINIMAL ROOM - TABLE, TWO CHAIRS. We may recognize
      it from the VIDEO the humanz sent to SIMON. In one chair: a
      MAN, 30s, beard and mustache grown out thick; in UNIFORM.
      KABLE sits down in the other.

                             SCOTCH

                   a semi-human being... they let you
                   out already?

      KABLE'S response doesn't match SCOTCH'S energy - he's bland,
      generic.

                   I'm sorry.

      KABLE'S "sorry" seems to refer to something only KABLE knows.

                             SCOTCH
                       (hesitant, making light)
                   Well, it's not like you ever looked
                   that good...

      A BEAT.   SCOTCH is suddenly conscious of the SURVEILLANCE.

      KABLE'S eyes flicker away from SCOTCH'S. He calmly removes
      his military issue .45 from it's holster and lets it rest on
      the table between them. He stares at it intensely, emotion
      starting to seep through the icy lines of his face.

                             SCOTCH (cont'd)

      HUMANZ BROTHER holds up a finger: shhh.

      and spasm in the chair.

      KABLE starts to shake; the gun rattles on the table top. A
      bead of sweat creeps down his forehead. It's apparent that
      he is locked in a paralyzing internal struggle...

      It seems to take all of KABLE'S strength to answer.                His
      voice is halting, human - not robotic like before.

                             KABLE
                   I can't stop it... can't...

      KABLE'S eyes meet SCOTCH'S; they are red, rimmed with tears.

      CASTLE brings up his hand, miming a gun.              He smiles.

      A pair of SKINNY LEGS walk up and kneel next to him: ANGIE.

                             SIMON
                   Cool.

                             AGENT KEITH
                       (sarcastic)
                   Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone
                   up the chain decided you're no
                   longer a threat.

                                                            CUT TO:

153   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE                           153

      SIMON slides open the door to his room, peaks inside
      hesitantly.

      It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up
      electronics and garbage. The wall-sized screens are all
      running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD, repeated in columns,
      by the thousands - scrolling fast, a digital waterfall of
      words, white on black:

                                      CHEATER

      It's over.

      SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus, in a state of
      mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING.

                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                                           94.

      He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING
      LOOP... then once again, attempting to activate SLAYERS
      control; the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we
      last saw on GORGE'S screen.

                             FEMALE VOICE
                   No link... no link.

      SIMON slumps against the wall, DEFEATED.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK.

154   EXT. CASTLE ESTATE - NIGHT                                                 154

      CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY.

      Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract
      statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a
      soul in sight.

      KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass.               Wind in the leaves,
      cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE.

      He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central
      MANSION.

      THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across
      the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES...

      KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run
      RIGHT PAST HIM. They round a corner and DISAPPEAR. Weird.

      KABLE looks up, spots a CAMERA... and another, and another...
      stands to reason he's been MARKED already.

      He walks out INTO THE OPEN.

155   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - NIGHT                                              155

      The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN.              KABLE walks
      right in.

      The interior is HUGE... and EMPTY. NO FURNITURE, no art; no
      people of course. Could anyone possibly live here?

      He explores...

156   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - EMPTY HALL - NIGHT                                 156

      AND THEN - at the FAR END of a large, empty HALL:

      A LITTLE GIRL, 5 - is sitting on the floor by herself,
      playing with DOLLS, making them walk and talk.


                                                                     (CONTINUED)

      KABLE'S eyes go wide.        He starts to walk toward her, slowly
      at first...

                                KABLE
                   Delia...

      ... and finally breaking into a run - until:

      He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling
      to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the
      glass...

                                KABLE (cont'd)
                   DELIA!

      ... then looks closer, running his fingers across the SMOOTH
      SURFACE.

                             KEN CASTLE (O.S.)
                   Not bad for video, eh?

      The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS; it seems to be
      everywhere at once, intimate.

                             KEN CASTLE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                   The latest and greatest... defy you
                   to tell it from real life. You
                   imagine porn on this thing?

      KABLE wants to EXPLODE - but he contains himself. He's
      playing CASTLE'S GAME, and the RULES are still UNDEFINED.

      Then - MUSIC: The SOUND of a SWINGIN' HI-HAT from down a long
      corridor -

      t - t - tssss, t - t - tssss, t - t - tsss...

      KABLE walks toward the source; a bass and piano pick up the
      groove.

157   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS                        157

      He comes to a BALLROOM - empty, like everything else; shiny
      hardwood floor for DANCING.

      A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above, illuminating KEN CASTLE.
      He's wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS. Every instinct tells KABLE
      to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's even
      real? And then CASTLE starts to SING...

      ... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I've
      Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE:

      I've got you under my skin

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                              96.

157   CONTINUED:                                                    157

      I've got you deep in the heart of me
      So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
      I've got you under my skin...

      He's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... THEN -
      from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear. We
      RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison,
      the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are
      wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES.

      KABLE grips his weapon, but the men are UNARMED; instead,
      they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE
      behind CASTLE...

      I'd sacrifice anything come what might
      For the sake of having you near
      In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
      And repeats, and repeats in my ear...

      KABLE notices SHADOWY FIGURES around the perimeter of the
      room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK
      SQUAD has moved in and taken position. They move their hands
      in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a
      DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick
      with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a
      ROCKETTE.

      Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the
      SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO
      SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY: it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD
      busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING
      EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away.

      Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
      Use your mentality, wake up to reality...
      But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP -
      before I give in
      Cause I've got you, under my skin...

      KABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to
      open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have
      taken care of that.

      KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS
      break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out
      they're flesh and blood after all.

      CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his
      SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand
      combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces...
      it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS,
      right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men,
      blood on his hands.

      CASTLE applauds; the GEEKS follow suit.

                          KEN CASTLE
                    (genuinely stoked)
                You're awesome.

                            KABLE
                Castle.

                            KEN CASTLE
                Kable.

      They speak simultaneously:

                  KABLE                               KEN CASTLE
      I don't care about you.               You don't care about me.

                          KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                ... you just want your little sugar
                pie, I know. So don't do anything
                stupido. My house, my rules.

      CASTLE walks away, leaving his back open to KABLE seemingly
      without concern, toward a side door.

                           KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                Come on, I want to show you
                something.

158   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                            158

      Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile:

      CASTLE walks along, confidently, KABLE following. The
      background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE.

                          KEN CASTLE
                I've got to thank you for leading
                me to them, by the by - the human-
                zuzz that is...

      Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF
      THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and
      LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks
      along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all
      tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH
      rising majestically in the dark heavens.

                          KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                Of course, soon enough they'd be
                whistling my tune like everybody
                else... but meantime it was that
                little cracker program they dreamed
                up that got my attention...

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   that was a genuine nuisance, no
                   doubt about it... One thing even
                   they didn't know, though: I'm wired
                   too.

      SNAP back to CASTLE, MEDIUM       CLOSE.     His eyes are FUCKING
      CRAZY.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

159   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                      159

      They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA
      regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard,
      bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank
      of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on.

      At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting
      baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in
      a FLEX BRACE.

      The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   But mine's different.
                       (taps his FOREHEAD)
                   Built to send - to transmit .
                   Whereas every other K-soft cell out
                   there - including the ones in...
                       (taps KABLE'S forehead )
                   your head, Kable - is designed to
                   receive. I think it, you do it.

      CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him...
      HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   We're talking every Slayer,
                   everyone in Society City... I
                   believe your better half would fall
                   under that category... provided
                   they're within range of my
                   transmitters...

      CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs over,
      picks up the ball and resumes shooting.

                             KABLE
                       (sarcastic)
                   Very nice, Castle. So you've got an
                   army of psychotics and deviants to
                   dance around for you.

      CASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he
      walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   You're thinking small, Kable. But
                   not as small as me.

      He sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and
      CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY
      FROM HIS FACE.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   See, nano cells are real small, a
                   thousand times smaller than even
                   these dust particulates...
                       (KABLE coughs)
                   Inhale it and they go to work:
                   replicating, spreading... like a
                   virus, multiplying in
                   exponentials... six months time I
                   could have 100 million people
                   converted - ditch diggers, porn
                   stars, presidents - and not one
                   would be the wiser.

      Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently
      TURNS TOWARD US.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   A hundred million folks that will
                   buy what I want them to buy, vote
                   how I want them to vote, do pretty
                   much damn well anything I figure
                   they ought to do.

      HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, at
      a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE
      KNIFE...

                              KEN CASTLE(cont'd)
                   For instance.

      KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE
      TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style.
      KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it -
      but leaving his face UNPROTECTED...

      HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face,
      connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this
      time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and
      WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with
      a sickening POP.

      SQUEEZES... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it...
      HACKMAN is choking, BEAT RED... for long, brutal seconds the
      life drains out of him... finally, HACKMAN'S eyes roll back;
      he GOES LIMP. KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMAN'S
      dead fingers.

      He struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood.

                          KABLE
                You should've let him fight for
                himself, Castle - he might've had a
                shot.

                          KEN CASTLE
                    (pleasant)
                I think you're missing the point,
                my man.

                          KABLE
                No, I get it - you're pulling the
                strings on all of this...
                    (starts to move toward
                     CASTLE with BAD INTENT)
                ... which makes my next move pretty
                easy to figure.

      KABLE comes at CASTLE FAST, bringing the KNIFE around to open
      his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER...

      His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR, the BLADE inches from contact.

                          KEN CASTLE
                Neglected to mention: my smart boys
                reversed that hack those fellas
                worked for you - easy breezy, once
                we had access to their drives...

      This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom, he
      feels his will ripped away from him... HE'S BEING PUPPETED BY
      THE MAN HE HATES THE MOST.

                          KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                You're mine, boy.

      With a twitch of CASTLE'S eyes KABLE brings the KNIFE down
      and SLICES OPEN HIS OWN LEG.

                                                        CUT TO:

160   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                              160

      SIMON is sitting on the floor, head hung low, in front of the
      dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to life:

      It's KABLE'S POV of KEN CASTLE.          CASTLE is stripping off his
      shirt.

                             KEN CASTLE
                       (on SCREEN)
                   Come on, lets boogie woogie rock
                   and roll.

                              SIMON
                   Ummm.

                                                            CUT BACK TO:

161   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                      161

      CASTLE throws a funky KARATE KICK and nails KABLE in the
      jaw... then a haymaker to the GUT, doubling KABLE over.

      He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he
      backs away.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   Biggest, baddest Slayer in the
                   game... don't seem like much, does
                   he?

      CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself. He uppercuts
      KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his
      knuckles.

                              KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Oww!

      KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs it
      perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH,
      MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon. CASTLE
      strikes a pose to match.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Lucky shot.
                       (grins)
                   OK, not really.

      He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE
      to the floor.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   I need an audience, boys.

      A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court; KABLE looks up
      slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see:

      ANGIE and DELIA are led into the room. ANGIE presses herself                *
      close to DELIA, holding her shoulders protectively.                         *

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                                 102.

      She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries            *
      to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her           *
      eyes; the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing, but           *
      ANGIE seems acutely aware that they are lethal. DELIA seems             *
      oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation.                   *

      CASTLE kicks KABLE across the floor, toward them.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   That's right, you crawl on your
                   belly like a toad...
                       (he looks to the GEEK
                        SQUAD, sheepish)
                   Is this bad? I'm really bad.

      He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of his
      DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously.                           *

      He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to               *
      ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel             *
      that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of              *
      what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking           *
      to KABLE for a clue.                                                    *

      KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and                 *
      gently touch her face...

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   That's sweet.

      CASTLE steps on KABLE'S hand, pinning it to the floor.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Alright boys, you ready? A true
                   test.

      He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates.

      KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT.

      ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at            *
      her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain              *
      against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...                     *

                               KABLE
                         (desperate)
                   No.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   Just like last time. Remember?

      KABLE is FIGHTING IT with all his will, his whole body
      shaking...

                            KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  You're stronger now... a little
                  more fight in you... but I think
                  the end result will be about the
                  same...                                                       *

                            KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  Shh.

      The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... He              *
      looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he                  *
      seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS                   *
      EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS.               *

      Suddenly:

      KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one
      quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the
      floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a
      hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into
      his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...

                            KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                      (freaked)
                  What the hell was that?

      The GEEKS break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning.
      Not even KABLE understands this.

      His body is positioned exactly like KABLE'S - right hand

      FORWARD...

      ... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is
      the one struggling for control; he claws weakly at KABLE'S
      hand, trying to loosen it off his neck...

                          KEN CASTLE

                JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN

                    (irritated)
                Working on it...

      KABLE'S eyes are locked in on CASTLE'S... straining with
      everything he has... his strength and will overpowering
      CASTLE, but-

                          KEN CASTLE
                    (like he's explaining the
                     obvious to a child)
                I think it.

      KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the
      knife away from CASTLE'S belly.

                          KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                You... fucking... do it...

      CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses
      his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained...
      CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back -
      every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin &
      Yang, veins rising in his neck...

      Then KABLE senses an opportunity:

                          KABLE
                Look at this knife... imagine me
                sticking it into your gut... think
                about it... make it real.

      CASTLE laughs... BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of
      course he can't help but picture it...

      ... and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE...

      ... CASTLE focuses, trying to pull it back out, but KABLE
      shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE
      TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND.

      The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw           *
      her arms around her daughter.                                           *

                   Damn it, kid...

      CASTLE collapses to his knees in front of KABLE, glass-eyed,
      draining life... they are FACE to FACE.

                              KABLE (cont'd)
                   ... is the fuckin pose really
                   necessary?

      CASTLE face-plants on the COURT.

                               SIMON
                   Sorry.

      KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor...
      then turns to face his family.

      When DELIA finally speaks there is a trace of CASTLE'S
      Georgia peach accent.

                             DELIA
                   Are you my Daddy Tillman?

      He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet,
      squeezing her close; she SQUEEZES BACK. KABLE grabs ANGIE
      with his other arm and pulls her in.

      The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment
      contract with CASTLE has just been terminated... shrug;
      pocket their shit, zip up their backpacks and fanny packs,
      get up and start to file out.

                   Wait.

      A VIDEO PLAYER WINDOW POPS UP:

      It's TRACE, filming        herself.

                             TRACE
                   This is for you, you dumb bitch.           I
                   hope you do the right thing with
                   it.

      The IMAGE switches to the CAPTURED FOOTAGE of KABLE in the
      military facility... leading up to SCOTCH'S murder.

      The light from the screen reflects on GINA PARKER SMITH'S
      face - she's wide-eyed, stunned.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)

      SHOOTING STARS fly past us in the dark... the SAME IMAGE WE
      STARTED WITH... only instead of an underground train carrying
      SOLDIERS to battle...

      The TUNNEL ENDS; we break from the side of a mountain into
      BLUE SKY AND SUNLIGHT.

      KABLE is driving on the open highway... ANGIE is in the
      passenger seat, asleep, head pressed up against the window
      glass.

      KABLE checks the rear view window; makes eye contact with
      DELIA, who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back
      seat.

                             KABLE
                   You good, sweetheart?

      DELIA nods.

      KABLE allows himself a smile, puts his eyes back on the road.
      ANGIE slowly reaches for KABLE'S hand, she rubs her thumb on
      his tattoo - "I am right here with you" - and falls back
      asleep.

      The CAMERA tilts up, stares out the front window and moves
      into the giant sun.

CARD OVER: SANDERSON PRISON

EXT. PRISON YARD - TITLES OVER - DAY

DOC McCOY IS BEING WALKED ACROSS THE COMPOUND BY A UNIFORMED
GUARD, carrying a riot gun. Other Prisoners around the yard
turn and stare as the two men head for the main building.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR

DOC WALKS DOWN THE BLEAK HALLWAY: A BLACK PRISONER PASSES Doc
in the corridor, they slap hands... the Guard remains at his
shoulder. Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs
open a barred door and allows Doc and the First Guard to
enter the room where he stands sentry.

INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

A LONG TABLE HAS BEEN SET UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM, several
Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing
the length of the room.

Seated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man;
floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is
beginning to grey. The Nameplate in front of him reads J.
BEYNON.

Doc enters the room and seats himself near two other
PRISONERS, the GUARD stands back against the wall.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             2.
CONTINUED:


Another table has been set up; this one near the seated
Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS
examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin.

A MAN at the center of the large table clears his throat,
then begins to speak.

                    CHAIRMAN
          I think we can begin... First parole
          request Carter "Doc" McCoy... is legal
          counsel present?

A MAN rises from behind the lawyers' table.

                    LAWYER
          Yes. Eugene Stewart representing Mr.
          McCoy.

                    DOC
          watching... taking it all in.

AT THE TABLE

The Man checks the papers before him.

                    CHAIRMAN
              (his voice a bored drone)
          Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence
          for armed robbery, first offense in the
          State of Texas, wanted by the State of
          Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and
          armed robbery...

                    LAWYER
          The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction,
          Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr.
          McCoy in connection with that case.

                    CHAIRMAN
              (adjusting his papers)
          That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has
          served four years of his sentence. Prison
          record satisfactory. Applied for parole
          on September 5th of this year...

The Chairman lowers the paper, looks across to the lawyer.

                    CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Remarks?




                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.
CONTINUED:


                    LAWYER
          We would only again like to call the
          committee's attention to Mr. McCoy's
          satisfactory behavior as a prisoner.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Notice is taken.

He looks down the table at the dark-suited men.

                    CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          The Board met in closed chambers last
          week... have you reached a decision
          regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

                    DOC
          His face is taut.

AT THE TABLE

A Second MAN looks across to the Chairman.

                    SECOND MAN
              (seated near Beynon)
          Request for parole is denied. The
          prisoner may re-apply in one calendar
          year.

                    DOC
          lowers his eyes, then looks up at his
          lawyer. The lawyer avoids Doc's glance.,
          he shuffles the papers in front of him,
          begins stuffing them into his briefcase.

AT THE TABLE THE CHAIRMAN FLIPS HIS PAPERS TO A NEW PAGE

                    CHAIRMAN
              (still totally without emotion)
          Very well. The next request for parole is
          from John Doty. Is legal counsel present?

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Yes.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Mr. Doty is serving five to twelve years
          for embezzlement of corporate funds.

DOC'S JAW TIGHTENS... HE AGAIN LOOKS AT THE FLOOR

DOC PLAYING CHESS WITH AN OLD CON IN A BLEAK WORK ROOM -
torn, magazines, beaten up radio, butt cans filled with sand.

                                                              4.



EXT. PRISON GATE - ANGLES

DOC AND OTHER PRISONERS RUN OUT OF THE GATE LEADING TO the
tractor driven carts that will take them to their work area.

EXT. EDGE OF FOREST

DOC AND WORK PARTY HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE FOREST and
begin to cut, file and burn brush. They are always guarded by
guards, some on horseback.

watches the other prisoners aimlessly wander around the
exercise yard.

Eagle tattooed on one shoulder.

A SENTRY TOWER - DUSK

A GUARD LOOKS OUT OVER THE EMPTY EXERCISE YARD... buildings
containing bleak cell blocks stand beyond the open compound.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

A WARDER JANGLES HIS KEY RING AS HE PASSES BY THE IRON doored
cells.

INT. TEXTILE MILL - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY

DOC AND OTHERS WORKING. THE NOISE OF MACHINERY IS deafening.
The clatter of the constantly working parts is maddening.

INT. CELL - NIGHT

DOC LIES ACROSS A SMALL COT WITHIN HIS SHADOW-CROSSED cell.
He works carefully at a toothpick suspension bridge. Doc
glues the final pieces into place...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              5.
CONTINUED:


Around the cubicle his personal effects can be seen, a
picture of an attractive woman, several battered paperbacks.

Doc continues looking at the bridge... then suddenly begins
smashing it to pieces with his right fist.

INT. PRISON - VISITING BUNGALOW - DAY

DOC IS SEATED... WAITING. CAROL enters the darkened room and
seats herself opposite Doc. They are separated by a wide
table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid-
point between them.

                    CAROL
              (big smile, she wants the
               moment to be an upper)
          Hello, Doc.

He simply stares back at her. Carol's finely honed features
compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second
glance shows willful strength. Doc continues looking at
Carol.

                       CAROL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

Doc is silent.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          It's been raining a lot the last few
          days.

Doc is silent.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          We'll try again.

                    DOC
          No way. I've got to get out now.

Get to Beynon, tell him I'm for sale. His price.

She looks at him.

                       DOC (CONT'D)
          Do it now.

She hesitates, tries to touch him through the mesh. Gets up
and leaves. Doc remains unmoving.

EXT. COUNTRY COURTHOUSE - SAN MARCOS, TEXAS - DAY

                                                             6.



CAROL MOVES TO THE BACK OF THE LARGE BTJILDING AND UP A REAR
STAIRWAY TOWARD THE OVERHEAD OFFICE.

INT. COURTHOUSE

CAROL ENTERS A LEGAL OFFICE, WEARING A SOFT BILLOWY dress.
She looks very good.

A middle aged SECRETARY looks up at Carol. A short balding
man (THE ACCOUNTANT) in his forties works at a large desk
across the room from the Secretary. He seems totally occupied
with his bookwork.

NEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORT

They are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be
anything at all but all three have commonality; they are
professionals.

HAYHOE - Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter
ender.

CULLY - Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop
out of his buttoned shirtsleeves...

SWAIN - a little older and a little smarter than the other
two, his narrow features allow no warmth.

                                              AFTER A MOMENT:

SECRETARY Yes?

                    CAROL
          I want to see Jack Beynon.

The Accountant nods to the Secretary, she points Carol
towards a door leading to an inner office.

                    SECRETARY
          Go right in, Mrs. McCoy.

DOC AND CAROL - PACES, PARTS OP BODIES, EMPHASIS ON HANDS, in
bed... his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her
stomach.

BACK WITHIN THE OFFICE THE THREE MEN LOOK AFTER CAROL

                    CULLY
          Class - regular?

                    SWAIN
          No. Doc McCoy's old lady.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              7.
CONTINUED:


Cully looks startled.

                    CULLY
          Jesus. Carol Ainsley?

                    SWAIN
          The very same.

                    CULLY
          The Doctor took out McGovern for her.

                    SWAIN
          She only rides winning - Class easy
          class.

                       ACCOUNTANT
          Shut up.

INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE

CAROL ENTERS.

A WOMAN'S LIPS - FLASH CUT

pressed against a man's neck. She kisses, then bites a tiny
portion of skin.

BACK TO BEYNON'S OFFICE. HE IS POURING A DRINK.

                    BEYNON
          How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

CAROL APPROACHES BEYNON'S DESK WITH A NERVOUSLY

DETERMINED STRIDE

                    CAROL
          Ready to talk about my husband, Mr.
          Beynon.

                     BEYNON
          So the good Doctor comes up again.
              (then)
          Please sit down.

                    CAROL
          He's asked me to come and see you.

Beynon looks at her... then lets their eyes meet.

                    BEYNON
              (handing her a drink)
          Why? Can I help?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              8.
CONTINUED:


                    CAROL
          Yes, I think you can.

A MAN'S FINGERS STARING AT THE ANKLET ON THE WOMAN'S LEG then
drawing an imaginary line upward... a woman's hand wearing a
wedding ring comes up to meet it.

INT. SANDERSON PRISON OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY

A UNIFORMED GUARD LEADS DOC DOWN THE HALLWAY, they turn a
corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed
in civilian clothes.

Doc catches sight of himself in a small mirror. He stops
looking uncertainly at the image... and then moves on with
the guard.

EXT. PRISON - DAY

DOC EXITS THE PRISON AND STANDS WAITING NEAR THE AUTO GATE.
He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the
edge of the penitentiary... Doc turns, looks again at the
prison... four years is a long time.

A dark Caddy is parked down the road.

INT. CADDY - DAY

THE ACCOUNTANT OR SWAIN SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL. He stares at
Doc. Doc crosses to him.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Mr. Beynon will see you the day after
          tomorrow 12:30 at the River Walk.

He gestures and drives away.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

DOC IS STILL WAITING

He leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance
way... The duffel bag rests beside him.

A late model Ford approaches, stops near Doc... the passenger
side door opens from the inside... Carol is driving... Doc
and Carol look at one another, their eyes holding several
moments.

INT. FORD - DAY

                                                              9.



BOTH CAROL AND DOC ARE VERY TENSE.

                     CAROL
           Hello, Doc.

                        DOC
           Hi.

                        CAROL
           You okay?

                      DOC
                (big smile)
           I'm a lot better off than I was an hour
           ago.

They look at each other for a moment. Carol leans forward...
Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses
her lightly, but with affection...

                     CAROL
           You want to drive?

                     DOC
           My license expired, let's get out of
           here.

                        CAROL
           Sure...

She starts the car, slips it into gear.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE FORD MOVES ALONG THE DESERTED ROADSIDE, crossing the
border and passing into the State of Texas.

INT. THE FORD

DOC ALTERNATELY STARES AT THE PASSING SCENERY, THEN BACK to
Carol.

                     CAROL
           I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair
           done... the girl was slow.

                     DOC
           It looks fine.

A pause.

                        CAROL
           Feel good?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            10.
CONTINUED:


                    DOC
          Yeah.

                    CAROL
          Where do you want to go?

                    DOC
          I want to take a walk.

He smiles, then reaches over and gently touches a strand of
Carol's hair.

EXT. RIVER - GRASSY BANK - SERIES OP ANGLES - DAY

THEY PARK THE CAR AND EXIT. DOC MOVES A LITTLE AHEAD OF
Carol. He sits on the bank watching the kids play.

YOUNG BOYS SWING ON A ROPE THAT HANGS OVER THE PALLS

COLLEGE KIDS, SOME ARE SWIMMING, SOME STUDYING, SOME just
grooving.

AN OLDER COUPLE SIT ON THE BANK, THEIR FEET IN THE WATER

CAROL SITS DOWN NOT TOO CLOSE. DOC IS SILENT FOR LONG
moments. Carol starts to speak but doesn't. He is
preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts.

Finally he stands, looking down at her. He slowly takes off
his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and
starts walking towards a tree.

Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives
for the rope.

CAROL IS ALREADY ON HER FEET, HER SWEATER OFF, SHOES kicked
aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward
splash. She is a brief second behind him.

THEY COME UP TOGETHER, AND HE LAUGHS WITH THE PURE JOY of
being free and alive. She joins him, in his laughter and with
their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept
down stream.

INT. EL OSO CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW A PORTION OF THE EXTERIOR BUILDING CAN
BE SEEN... The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived
here almost two years. On the wall there is a poster (which
will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now
on).



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.
CONTINUED:


Around the room are drying clothes. Carol is ironing with a
steam iron.

Doc is sitting at a table with a Colt .45 in front of him and
a .32 automatic. He is field stripping. There is a bowl of
peaches on the table.

                    DOC
              (pointing to the poster)
          It doesn't look like that.

                    CAROL
          What do you mean? You've never been
          there.

                    DOC
          I've been there every day for the last
          four years.

at her and begins sampling.

He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward
the stairs.

INT. BEDROOM

THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE
bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she
stares vacantly expectant.

Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with
agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping
Doc drop the garment down to her waist.

Doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder... her
hair... he kisses her... Doc gently eases himself away from
Carol.

Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains

STICKS of dynamite, two tubes of Naptha, a lot of prima cord
and one small, dark percussion cap.

CAROL SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE GREY PANEL TRUCK as it
prowls smoothly down a brush-lined Central Texas road. Carol
drives calmly, professionally...

          clock-face on the bomb against his
          wristwatch... with a quick, dexterous
          movement, he places a bomb into the two
          large grocery bags at his feet. After
          burying the explosives within each sack,
          he covers the bombs with crumpled
          wastepaper.

INT. A '65 BUICK - RUDY

PARKED ALONG A SECLUDED PATHWAY, facing the highway which
lies a quarter of a mile away.

He has on a trench coat buttoned to the neck and his sailor's
watch cap... he stares at the highway.

EXT. MAIN STREET - BEACON CITY, TEXAS - DAY

A sleepy, traditional municipality...

A DAPPER GENTLEMAN IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES WALKS ALONG THE
SIDEWALK. He is the PRESIDENT of the First Bank of Beacon
City -- nodding to a few passersby, he stops at the front
door of the bank, knocks twice. A BANK GUARD opens the door
and the Bank President moves inside.

VISIBLE ON THE GLASS DOOR

sign that reads:

FIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY

Founded 1911 Hours: 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM Weekdays Only

INT. THE BANK

THE PRESIDENT SNAPS ON A BANK OF IRRIDESCENT LIGHTS. Several
TELLERS have begun setting up for the day's commerce...

INT. PANEL TRUCK

DOC SHIFTS HIS POSITION SLIGHTLY, THEN   PULLS HIS .45 OUT from
beneath his jacket. Doc breaks out the   clip, examines it,
snaps it back to position. He replaces   the gun under his
jacket -- the gesture seemingly more a   mannerism than a
precaution.

A huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the
floor of the truck near Doc, along with a black leather
suitcase.

CAROL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, Beacon City appears on the
horizon through the windshield...

INT. BANK

THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TURNING THE COMBINATION on the massive
door as the vault begins to open...

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - DRIVING DOWN THE ROADWAY near the
outskirts of town. A Texas Highway Patrol car passes, moving
in the opposite direction...

JACKSON - IN THE HAY TRUCK - PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES,
then checks his watch.

A WATCH FACE SHOWS THE TIME AT 8:56.

THE WATCH BELONGS TO DOC. He looks expectantly towards Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK is now within the commercial district of
Beacon City. Rudy's Buick is visible a hundred yards behind.

THE HAY TRUCK drives off Main Street and into an open field
near a corner of the town.

Jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to
the sidewalk.

Rudy's Buick pulls over and Jackson gets into the passenger
seat. The Buick then cruises back out onto Main Street...

CAROL - IN THE VAN - APPROACHES AN INTERSECTION. Through the
truck's window a traffic signal appears.

RUDY PULLS THE BUICK OFF THE MAIN DRAG and onto a side
street. Another turn and he again moves parallel to the Main
Street...

                                                           28.



INT. BANK

THE BANK PRESIDENT LEAVES THE VAULT, allowing the heavy door
to stand open.

A LATTICE-WORK BARRIER made of wrought-iron is pulled across
the vault opening... the Bank President snaps the latch-lock
closed.

CAROL - IN THE PANEL TRUCK. She pulls the van carefully to a
stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red... She
turns her eyes back to Doc...

DOC, CATCHES HER LOOK, then instantly springs into action. He
reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of
the truck, revealing the road below... a portion of a manhole
cover is visible.

                      DOC
                (barking the words)
            Two feet forward...

CAROL ROLLS THE TRUCK SLIGHTLY FORWARD

ON THE STREET - SEVERAL CARS can be seen moving up behind the
panel truck.

DOC GRABS THE TONGS, inserts the ends into the manhole cover
notches. He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover
forward. Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into
open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him. As he
disappears from sight...

98 RUDY DRIVING ON THE SIDE AVENUE, still moving parallel 98
to Main Street. The Buick is now geographically well forward
of the panel truck. Jackson stares at his watch.

                      JACKSON
            Now!

Rudy makes a sharp left. The car accelerates, its wheels
begin to quietly whine.

Main Street comes back into view...

CAROL WATCHING THE SIGNAL... still red...

A MAN IN A PONTIAC eases to a stop behind the panel truck. He
watches the signal.

DOC STANDING IN THE SEWER PIPE. He turns on a flashlight,
moves ahead. His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky
water.

Doc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines
that run along the sewer wall... He moves down the dark oval
corridor...

EXT. THE BANK

THE GUARD OPENS THE FRONT DOOR, allowing the morning PATRONS
to enter.

INT. THE BANK

THE PRESIDENT SMILES UPON SEEING THE CUSTOMERS. He looks over
to the wood-frame clock on the far wall.

THE CLOCK READS 9:00 EXACTLY

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - MAKES ANOTHER LEFT TURN, now back onto
Main Street.

THE BANK APPEARS A HALF-BLOCK AWAY through the car window.
Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces;
the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a
disparity between their features...

MAIN STREET - THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL has now blinked to green.

CAROL IS GRINDING AWAY AT THE DEAD ENGINE of the panel
truck...

THE MAN IN THE PONTIAC leans on his HORN... other cars behind
him begin to HONK.

CAROL LEANS OUT OF THE CAB OF THE PANEL TRUCK and gestures
for the cars to pass her. She again GRINDS away at the
engine.

DOC'S WATCH - SHOWING 9:01.

DOC STANDS AT A MASSIVE CONNECTING BOX where four 112 strands
of the conduit intersect. He puts the wire cutters to the
first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a
crunching POP, he cuts through the conduit with one bite. Doc
immediately starts on the next strand.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

THE BUICK SLAMS TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE BANK. Rudy Il4 and
Jackson pull open the car doors.

DOC CUTTING THE LAST AND LARGEST CONDUIT.

                                                             30.



INT. THE BANK

THE BANK GUARD is placing a local high school basketball
schedule and display into position.

SEVERAL PATRONS have formed small lines and are transacting
business with the Tellers.

The wall clock shows the time at 9:02.

RUDY AND JACKSON BURST THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR. They stand
shoulder to shoulder, guns extended the full length of their
arms. Beneath the mask Rudy's smile is visible.

THE BANK GUARD LOOKS UP PROM THE BASKETBALL DISPLAY. His eyes
widen... both guns are leveled directly at him...
simultaneously the lights go out...

THE BANK PRESIDENT DESPERATELY PUSHES THE ALARM BUTTON near
his desk. (INSERT: Button and bell.) Nothing happens.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

INT. A DENTIST'S OFFICE

THE D.D.S. TORTURES A BALDING PATIENT with a drill. The
PATIENT groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain.

When the power goes, the Dentist quizzically raises the drill
and examines it. The Patient pants in relief.

                    DENTIST
          Superior technology, my ass.

AN ELECTRIC WEATHER/TIME INDICATOR - above the town square...
as the bulbs dim...

DOC RUNNING DOWN THE SEWER; stopping at the manhole he
scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire
cutters up into the truck parked over him.

CAROL - IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT - again she tries to start the
engine.

DOC PULLING HIMSELF BACK UP INTO THE VAN with a gymnastic
thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs.

CAROL - the engine still won't start.

DOC DROPS THE HATCH DOOR back down into place on the floor of
the truck...



                                                 (CONTINUED)

             Okay.

CAROL TURNS THE IGNITION SWITCH BACK ON...

CAROL - AS THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE she engages the
gearshift. The truck begins to move forward. Suddenly, the
motor does STALL.

DOC'S PACE TIGHTENS. The cars behind the van continue
HONKING.

CAROL - AGAIN GRINDING AWAY AT THE ENGINE. Her lips are
compressed into a thin line... After a moment... the motor
catches, the truck again moves forward.

DOC PICKS UP THE LARGE BLACK SUITCASE from the floor of the
panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK WHIPS OFF MAIN STREET and onto a side avenue.
Carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop.

DOC IS NOW IN THE FRONT SEAT BESIDE CAROL. He pulls the truck
door open, then hesitates. He touches her arm, their eyes
meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment. Doc
gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck.

ON THE SIDEWALK

DOC TURNS AND BEGINS WALKING toward an open alleyway. Behind
him the panel truck pulls smoothly away.

WALKING UP THE ALLEY - DOC PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES.
He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley.

The alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite
end is bounded by a large brick building. Doc removes his
pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along
the side of the brick building. At the last moment he pulls
down the watch cap mask.

INT. BANK

RUDY DISENGAGES THE LATCH on the side door.

EXT. ALLEY

DOC KICKS THE DOOR OPEN with a violent jerk of his leg.

                                                            32.



INT. THE BANK

RUDY'S GUN IS TRAINED PROM THE BACK OF THE BUILDING over the
Tellers and Patrons, spread-eagled across the floor. Their
heads are down; several of them are trembling.

DOC STANDS HOLDING THE .45 IN ONE HAND, suitcase in the
other. He moves into the building, shutting the door behind
him.

RUDY IS NOW STATIONED NEAR THE FRONT DOOR, ready to intercept
any incoming bank patrons -- he covers the room from the end
opposite Jackson.

Rudy stands near the Bank Guard's outstretched right hand --
The Guard's head is bloodied from Rudy's pistol whipping. His
gun has been kicked against the wall. A short distance away
Rudy is watching.

THE BANK PRESIDENT lies face down on the floor, directly
under the arc of Jackson's gun... who is continually turning
to watch the Guard.

DOC QUICKLY CROSSES THE DISTANCE between the side door and
the vault, passing the Bank President. He slips the .45 into
his jacket side pocket, sets down the suitcase, then either
cuts the lock or picks it.

                    RUDY
              (looking at his watch)
          19 seconds.

CAROL - IN THE VAN - She has stopped the panel truck near the
deserted lot where the hay truck is parked.

She drops the bomb-laden grocery bag inside the truckbed. She
moves back towards the van...

IN THE BANK

DOC FINISHES,, RIPS THE DOOR OPEN, lifts the suitcase and
moves into the vault.

RUDY LOOKS AT THE BLOODIED GUARD, notes the distance
separating the man from his gun. Though unconscious, the
Guard's head begins to move.

JACKSON HOLDS HIS GUN HAND FULLY EXTENDED. Again he takes a
brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and
at the Guard.

ANGLES AND INSERTS - THE VAULT is lined with safety deposit
boxes and large cabinet drawers.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


A metal table stands off-center, the black suitcase resting
on its surface. Doc opens the satchel. He then pulls open one
of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money
pads into the open suitcase.

THE BANK PRESIDENT LIES NEAR THE OPEN VAULT. He listens to
the SOUNDS of Doc at work. He slightly cranes his neck,
trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault.

RUDY WATCHING THE FRONT DOOR. A PATRON enters; Rudy gestures
with the gun... she hits the deck.

JACKSON IS GETTING MORE NERVOUS by the minute...

DOC continues working within the vault.

THE WOMAN, now on the floor, quietly crying.

JACKSON watching the Guard.

RUDY watching Jackson. Calling out time.

THE BANK GUARD, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look
of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is
ready for one more round.

THE BANK PRESIDENT in his prone position. He looks at
Jackson, then to the vault.

THE PANEL TRUCK - now at the other end of Main Street.

CAROL EXITS THE VAN, carries the second sack to a large
rubbish bin in front of an empty store. She deposits the
grocery bag...

DOC WORKING. The suitcase is now filled. He snaps the
fasteners shut .

DOC EXITS THE VAULT after withdrawing his .45 from his coat
pocket .

JACKSON SEES DOC LEAVE THE VAULT. He edges around the side of
the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank.

DOC MOVES TOWARDS JACKSON'S OLD VANTAGE POINT NEAR THE SIDE
DOOR. He passes the bank president.

RUDY NOW WATCHES DOC

DOC CARRIES THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN HIS LEFT HAND. He gestures
to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the
side door.

JACKSON HALF RUNS PASSING RUDY ON HIS WAY TO THE FRONT
ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard.

THE BANK GUARD STILL PUNCH DRUNK PULLS HIMSELF UP TO HIS
HANDS and knees... the Guard looks at his pistol.

DOC STOPS AT THE KICKED IN SIDE DOOR. HE COVERS THE ENTIRE
bank with his gun.

THE BANK GUARD BEGINS TO CRAWL WITH AGONIZING SLOWNESS
towards his pistol.

RUDY EYES STILL ON DOC

JACKSON NOW AT THE FRONT DOOR IS PARALYZED WATCHING THE
GUARD.

DOC GESTURES TO RUDY AND JACKSON TO GET MOVING.

EXT. STREET - DAY

CAROL PARKS THE VAN, CROSSES TO A FORD, GETS IN, DRIVES AWAY.

INT. BANK

THE GUARD HAS MORE THAN HALF CLOSED THE DISTANCE TO THE .38.

JACKSON LEVELS HIS .44.

            Just pick it up.

                      RUDY
            Don't!

JACKSON PULLS THE TRIGGER THREE TIMES.

THE BANK GUARD'S BODY turns end-over-end from Jackson's
bullets. Some of the bank Patrons SCREAM, others SOB with
fright.

DOC - His eyes are furious.

RUDY AND JACKSON - Rudy shoves Jackson out the front door.

DOC COVERS THEIR EXIT, then slips out the side door and into
the alley.

                                                             35.



EXT. MAIN STREET

RUDY GUNS THE BUICK FORWARD, the wheels tearing at the
asphalt. Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car
accelerates.

                    THE ALLEY
          DOC, GUN AND SUITCASE IN HAND, nears the
          end of the alleyway.

CAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway
opening.

DOC TOSSES THE SUITCASE into the back of the car... then
slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel
as Carol slides over to the passenger seat.

INT. THE FORD

DOC PULLS OFF THE WATCH CAP MASK; his face taut.

THE FORD SMOKES OFF as Doc kicks it into gear...

MAIN STREET BEACON CITY A SERIES OF ANGLES

THE BUICK STREAKS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROADWAY... Two bombs
detonate into fireballs... The Hay truck blazes upward, bales
instantly igniting.

The grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange-
flame inferno...

Traffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk
at the twin blazes.

RUDY ZIG ZAGS THE BUICK ALONG. Maneuvering through the
stopped traffic.

DOC SLIDES THE FORD THROUGH A RIGHT AND LEFT TURN, emerging
onto smoke-covered Main Street.

The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins
out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood
bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the
grass of a small park.

INT. FORD '

DOC LOOKS MORE THAN A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AS CAROL STARES

AT him.

POLICE CARS ROAR BY THEM.

                                                           36.



EXT. SMALL PARK

DOC ZIPS THE CAR OFF THE GRASS AND BACK ONTO THE TRAFFIC
CLOGGED ROADWAY.

RUDY DRIVING THROUGH THE BEDLAM. Suddenly a gun appears in
his right hand, aimed at Jackson. The pistol roars bucks,
roars, bucks again. Jackson is shot through the head twice.

THE FORD IS SEVERAL BLOCKS BEHIND RUDY. DOC DOWNSHIFTS
avoiding stalled cars. Carol grasps at both the seat and the
dashboard handholds to maintain her balance.

THE BUICK EMERGES THROUGH DENSE PLUMES OF SMOKE. Fire licks
along the one edge of the sidewalk.

RUDY IN THE BUICK HAS NOW ALMOST CLEARED THE TOWN. He tears
along the highway... sweating a little but becoming cool. He
is a pro. His watch cap is now removed.

ON THE CURVE - Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile
and bounces across the pavement.

DOC IN THE FORD POWERS ALONG. He approaches the flaming
building, then hits the brakes as ...

A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite
direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying
to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street .

DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the
smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four
wheel drift. Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the
sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars,
through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign,
then bores back onto the road.

RUDY IN THE BUICK STROKING ALONG THE OPEN HIGHWAY. Looks in
the rear view mirror.

RUDY'S POV - THROUGH THE BUICK'S REAR WINDOW, BLACK smoke is
visible billowing skyward.

DOC AND CAROL IN THE FORD NOW DRIVING CALMLY THROUGH the
countryside. A police car with light turning and siren
wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon
City. Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears
from sight.

THE BUICK - SERIES OF ANGLES - IT pulls off the highway and
bumps down a dirt road. Rudy strains to hold the big car on
the rutted pathway.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             37.
CONTINUED:


The dirt road becomes a lane.

A farm house and barn appear at a clearing. Rudy powers the
car up a fairly steep hill, the crest of which is occupied by
a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn.

RUDY JUMPS OUT OF THE BUICK, trots to the front of the barn
and pulls the double-doors open. A station wagon with wooden-
panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within...

THE FORD SWEEPS OFF THE HIGHWAY and onto the dirt road.

WITHIN THE FORD - DOC IS DRIVING. Carol peels off her
sweater. She has worn a faded blouse underneath... She pulls
a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance.

RUDY - IN THE BARN - The Buick is now parked near the Station
Wagon. Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun,
then moves towards the large doors of the barn.

CAROL - IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE FORD - she watches as
Doc drives up the lane...

RUDY stands outside the barn as the car approaches.

DOC STUDIES RUDY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, watching him wipe
his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer...

INT. BARN

DOC PULLS THE FORD TO A STOP just within the double doors. He
passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway
station wagon.

DOC JUMPS OUT OF THE FORD AS SOON AS the ignition switch is
cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side.

Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors.
He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks
around him.

Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy.
He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase,
not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained
a great weight.

                      DOC
                (speaking over his shoulder,
                 not looking at Rudy)
            Where's Jackson?

Rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             38.
CONTINUED:


                    RUDY
              (pointing his gun lazily at
               Doc, supremely confident)
          He didn't make it, Doc... you didn't
          either.

Doc straightens, still holding the suitcase. He starts to
turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless. Carol fumbles for the gun
in her purse.

Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. Doc
swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face
Rudy's bullets... then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the
chest, Doc's .45 slug driving him backward.

Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. He
drops the suitcase with his first shot, FIRES again, blasting
Rudy in the middle. Two large holes now show at the chest of
Rudy's raincoat.

Rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the
precipice and into a grassy meadow below. Doc stands at the
crest of the hill. He looks down as Rudy's body stops
turning. Doc shifts the .45 to his right hand.

Rudy's body lies still.

DOC TURNS QUICKLY AWAY PROM THE HILLTOP, not giving Rudy's
body a second glance. Carol, gun in hand, stands outside the
barn, transfixed.

                    CAROL
          How did you know?

Doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car... the getaway
car... as she starts to change clothes... he reloads. Doc
takes a long look at Carol.

THEY GET IN THE CAR AND LEAVE.

EXT. BOTTOM OP HILL - DAY

CAROL IS DRIVING., tooling comfortably along a country road.
Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat.
After several moments of silence:

                    CAROL
          What about the bank?

                    DOC
              (after a moment)
          Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          39.
CONTINUED:


Carol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side
window.

                    CAROL
          Oh, Christ.

Doc leans forward., snaps on the radio.

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY

RUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and
onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly
grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs,
along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on
his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is
obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch.

EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY

RUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water
gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the
yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the
padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall
to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone.

RUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his
hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash
the purling water across his face and then he laughs.

INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

DIALOGUE COMES ON THE RADIO DESCRIBING THE ROBBERY. $750,000
stolen.

                    DOC
          We got between four and five.

Carol starts to open the bag and count.

Doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. Doc
reflectively studies the roadside ahead. They are heading
along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that
carries only a sparse amount of traffic.

Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead.

                    CAROL
              (now noticing the road)
          Doc...

                     DOC
              (flat)
          I see it...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             40.
CONTINUED:


ON THE ROAD AHEAD HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE FORMED a traffic
barricade. Several cars and trucks are being waved through
the check-point. Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the
Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing
vehicle.

DOC ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITHOUT CHANGING EXPRESSION He
slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line
of slowly-passing vehicles.

She turns, starts to reach into the back. Doc gently catches
her arm, preventing her from moving further.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          They're looking for three men...
          remember?

A YOUNG OFFICER looks into the cab of the pickup, then
glances at the empty flatbed. Another PATROLMAN flanks the
other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. Several
Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional OFFICERS, are
parked nearby. The pickup truck is waved through. The station
wagon rolls up to the check-point.

DOC ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW. He smiles and nods to the Young
Patrolman.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (big smile)
          What's the problem?

CAROL STUDIES THE OFFICER on her side of the car through the
closed window... the Officer peers back at her then into the
rear seat.

THE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by
the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock...
After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio.

EXT. THE FARM - RUDY - DAY

Inside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's
matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face. He
starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a ROAR. The panel
truck leaps crazily forward, careening across the barn floor,
SMASHING through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts
out into the sunlight.

EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

The station wagon rolls down the main street and stops near
an outdoor phone booth at a filling station.

                                                         41.

                    DOC
          So what. I've got to give him his money.
          That was our end of the deal.

                    CAROL
          He might be ready to chop us up.

                    DOC
          Do it my way.

He starts the engine. The station wagon pulls away.

INT. STATION WAGON

AS IT PULLS OUT OF THE SMALL TOWN.

              (continuing; hesitant)
          Do you trust him?

                    DOC
          I just figure the percentages. He
          wouldn't try a cross until he's got the
          money.

          Let's send his cut back -- Just keep

          Do it my way.

The wagon continues moving down the road.

EXT. A NARROW DIRT ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET. A CHILL SOUTHWEST WIND is blowing.
The station wagon appears, moving slowly down the roadway,
bouncing along its rutted surface.

AT A SMALL INTERSECTION TWO MAIL BOXES STAND CLOSE to one
another. The name Beynon is printed in black paint on one of
the letter bins. Doc stops the wagon momentarily, looks at
the box, then turns down the indicated road.

EXT. THE STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

THE STATION WAGON clears the crest of a sage brush hill and
passes camera.

INT. STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC PARKS THE WAGON UNDER A GNARLED COTTONWOOD TREE in front
of the house. As he shuts off the engine, he pulls the .45
out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband.
Carol watches the gesture. Doc starts to open the car door,
then hesitates.

                    DOC
          You can wait here... I'll wrap it up
          fast.

DOC STEPS OUT OF THE WAGON, then pulls the leather suitcase
out of the back. He quietly shuts the car door and moves
around the side of the house, toward the barn/garage at the
rear.

HE LOOKS CAREFULLY around the area, his eyes searching for
signs of Beynon's men. Nothing seemingly amiss, he moves
toward the front door, tries it, moves away.

Doc crosses to the back screen door of the house. After
another moment, Doc quietly opens the screen door and enters
the house.

INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the
kitchen.

                                                          44.



INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT

BEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes
slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him
is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking
the sour mash straight with a water chaser.

DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase
down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass
and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes
a sip.

                    BEYNON
          Hello, McCoy.

              (swishing the drink)
          News said two persons killed.

Except for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite
sober. Beynon wears a .38 Detective Special C.T.G. in a worn
leather belly holster.

Doc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking
the money.

          No way. I always do my own work.

Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's
glass.

          Here. I understand the way you feel. As a
          matter of fact, you and I might share a
          great many feelings...

Beynon drinks from his glass. Doc continues counting the
money.

          No applause!

Beynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table
into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet
sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair,
stands beside the table.

          robber serving a long sentence in prison.
          Three, a man with political influence, a

Beynon sips his glass slowly. Doc's hand edges down toward
his waist band.

              (continuing)
          A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious

                    BEYNON
          Close... but it takes a hell of a lot
          more than promises to pull the kind of
          strings I pulled.

                    DOC
          I bet.

Doc senses a movement from the shadows behind Beynon. Turning
his head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance
to the kitchen. She holds a .32 automatic... the pistol seems
to be pointed directly at Doc.

                    BEYNON
          You wouldn't have come here when you were
          eight3 Mr. McCoy.

As the gun continues to be pointed directly at Doc.

                    BEYNON (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Don't think too badly of her... After
          all, you were in jail a long time and she
          is a healthy young woman.

                    DOC
              (riding over Beynon's words)
          Get it over with...

CAROL FIRES the automatic. The big gun belches the full slip
in a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an
ejected position.

BEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud,
the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens
against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore
slugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned
table. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes
two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it
clattering and spinning away across the floor.

DOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns,
moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills
a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at
her.

CAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks.

DOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent
shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen
toward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight,
only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.

                                                             48.



INT. PANEL TRUCK - DUSK

Rudy is driving along an open highway. Rudy mouths inane
lyrics to the radio, one arm on the wheel, the other
clutching his wound. A small sign near a mailbox catches
Rudy's eye. He swings the panel truck around in a U-turn,
then pulls into the long dirt driveway of an isolated farm
house.

THE SIGN READS

HAROLD CLINTON, D.V.M.

Practice of Veterinary Medicine.

EXT. DESERTED HIGHWAY - DUSK

THE STATION WAGON IS PARKED ALONG THE CEMENT ROAD, standing
in isolation against the vast Texas b.g.

Doc stands away from the car, his back turned to it ...
gazing at the horizon.

Carol is in the wagon but the passenger side door is open,
her legs dangle outside the car as she looks steadily at the
ground. Doc suddenly turns, walks to her and gives her a
stinging slap across the face.

                    DOC
          Stupid.

Tears begin to roll down Carol's face.

          Yeah.

INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Swain sleeps on the davenport. Cully and Hayhoe sit at two
sides of Beynon's large desk, playing a game of checkers...
Hayhoe seems to have Cully badly beaten ... The Accountant
enters the room. The block on the wall shows eight o'clock
straight up.

                       ACCOUNTANT
          Let's go.

The two men abandon their game. Cully kicks the sofa,
awakening Swain. He groggily gets to his feet.

INT. MULTI-STORIED AUTO PARK - SAN ANTONIO - DAY

The station wagon enters the building. Doc takes a bright
orange ticket from an ATTENDANT behind a glass window, then
accelerates the wagon up a rampway leading to the upper
levels of the building.

                    DOC
          checks his watch momentarily as he prowls
          the wagon between long rows of
          automobiles.

THE STATION WAGON'S TIRES

WHINE through a sweeping turn within the auto park's
uppermost level -- through the building's portals the bright
morning sun can be seen reflecting off the city's rooftops.

DOC PULLS THE WAGON to an abrupt halt within a parking stall -
- at an isolated area. He steps out onto the concrete
flooring, slams the door shut.

Doc turns away from the car. As he approaches the elevator,
Doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops
them into a trash bin without missing a stride.

INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING

CAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward.
She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and
her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket
buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical
to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike.
Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend
off into clumped rows within the wings of the station.

CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase
flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in
place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy
item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly
ticket-seller looks across to her.

                    CAROL
          Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer.

                    TICKET-SELLER
          Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in
          forty-five minutes, gate three.

Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse
along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back
into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the
seemingly acres-wide station promenade.

NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits
uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests
on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances
across the promenade walls, her eyes finding:

A CLOCK READING: 9:40

ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER

CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers
waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her.

Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap,
pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins
rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from
the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather
satchel.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            51.
CONTINUED:


CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the
suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around
her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass-
walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge
in that direction.

A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol
approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the
numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small
suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman
quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than
tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps
to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then
studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face
of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens
the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the
locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the
door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her
predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter
out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered
directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder.

THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher
features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap
corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The
Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.

                    DAPPER MAN
          Kind of tricky, isn't it?

She turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth
movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand,
deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open.
Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests
it to show that it

has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and
puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by
the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his
intentions.

                       CAROL
          Thank you.

                    DAPPER MAN
              (toothy grin)
          No trouble lady.

Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a
welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure
for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her
purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail
Lounge.

                                                            52.



INT. BARN - DAY

EMPTY CAGES STACKED ALONG A WOODEN WALL

A YOUNG KITTEN IN A CARDBOARD BOX wrestling with the barrel
of a .44. A thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the
fur along the cat's neck and backbone.

RUDY BUTLER IS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE CAT, giving little
attention to the thirtyish Man standing nearby.

HAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the
medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn-
like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls,
cages and pens, many of them vacant.

The wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been
attached to his left arm and shoulder.

FRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite   Rudy. Five
years younger than her husband, tight sweater and   skirt,
bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her   face
suggests sensuality. Fran's bare, milk-white legs   are crossed
under her rumpled skirt.

                    RUDY
              (to Harold)
          What's the damage?

                    HAROLD
          Collar bone is broken. No infection
          yet... the bandages should be changed
          twice a day.

                    RUDY
          I got a nurse in mind.

                    HAROLD
              (going along, oblivious to the
               implication)
          The glucose will begin working in half an
          hour. You'll feel better then...

                     RUDY
              (flashing a grin despite the
               pain)
          The three of us are going to do some
          traveling. We're going to take your car
          to El Paso.

                    HAROLD
          That's not possible. We can't leave
          here... we've got all this.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

Rudy smiles at Mrs. Clinton. He's never met Fran before, but
he's known her for years.

                    RUDY
          Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?

                    FRAN
              (scared, but trying to be
               friendly)
          Just... tell us what you want.

Rudy looks back down at the gun and cat. The following
silence is like a scream. Finally:

                    RUDY
          What kind of car do you have, Harold?

                    FRAN
              (cutting in)
          A Ford... We have a Ford.

                    RUDY
          That's good. That's very good. Now
          Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford,
          check the oil and tires, we don't want
          any problems on the road. One more
          thing... If anybody but you comes back...

He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          She gets her clock fixed right away...
          You understand that, Harold?

A long pause.

                    FRAN
          You do what he says, Harold.

                    RUDY
          After you come back I'll listen while you
          make some phone calls, tell a few friends
          you've got to leave for a week or two...
          You have to call another Vet about the
          animals. You tell him to come over and
          take good care of them starting
          tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got
          to be looked after...

                    HAROLD
          We really don't have too many friends.

              (smiling)
          That makes things a little easier for us
          then, doesn't it?

INT. TRAINS STATION BAR - DAY

Carol sits in the bar. A young SOLDIER approaches and sits
down at the counter next to her. She is finishing a vodka
gimlet.

                    SOLDIER
              (to a bartender)
          Beer.

Carol glances at her watch.

                    SOLDIER (CONT'D)
              (continuing - begins with the
               obvious)
          Guess you have to catch a train?

                    THE SOLDIER
          pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has to
          shave maybe twice a week; twenty-one
          years old, not good-looking (his best
          feature is his gentle, easy grin) and not
          a hustler. He just wats to meet a girl.

                    CAROL
              (not too patronizing)
          That's right.

                    SOLDIER
          Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough
          and I'm goin' home.

The soldier's beer arrives.

                    CAROL
          Where's home?

                    SOLDIER
          Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem,
          right near Salt Lake ... Say, you
          wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would
          you?

          No, I'm not.

                    SOLDIER
          Me, neither. There's about twelve people
          in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm
          one of them.

                     CAROL
          That certainly makes you kind of
          special...

                    SOLDIER
              (awkward)
          Yeah... I guess it does.

Carol pushes aside her glass.

                    SOLDIER (CONT'D)
              (c ont inuing)
          You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt
          Lake, would you?

                    CAROL
              (smiles across to him)
          No, I'm afraid not.

                    SOLDIER
          I never have any luck.

Carol smiles at the soldier. Her features suddenly freeze as
she glances toward the entrance to the bar.

AT THE DOORWAY

DOC STANDS LOOKING AT CAROL and the soldier.

                    CAROL
          STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          I really hope you have a nice trip.

                    SOLDIER
          Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

Carol moves towards the exit.

The soldier quietly sips his beer, his face a bit grim.

AT THE DOORWAY

CAROL STOPS NEAR DOC.

They look at each other...

                    DOC
          Where's the suitcase?

Carol continues looking at Doc for a moment.

Then, suddenly moves past him, leading him out into the main
lobby.

                                       BACK WITHIN THE PROMENADE

SERIES OF ANGLES

CAROL EMERGES FROM THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE followed by Doc.

They cross to the lockers.

She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the
proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then
forcing the key, shakes the lock violently.

Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the
locker number and then the number on the key. Her features
are now totally ashen.

She walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another
locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty.

Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear...
Doc at her shoulder.

                    CAROL
          A man helped me open it...

                    DOC
              (deceptive calm)
          And switched keys.

                    CAROL
          He must have.

                    DOC
              (angrily)
          It isn't another boyfriend, is it?

Carol winces, containing her anger.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - icily)
          How long ago.

          Sure?

Carol nods.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - with quick
               calculation)
          He'd figure you for longer, enough time
          to try another hit. He's probably still
          in the station.

As Doc pushes Carol forward.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - lashing out)
          There better be a guy with the

                    CAROL
              (lashing back)
          You bastard...

Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc
forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They
reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the
promenade... eyes straining.

CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her
eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of
lockers, the black suitcase at his feet.

THE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same
moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He
takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement
that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag
and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons.

DOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves
immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to
keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of
lockers.

CAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now
disappeared from view. She sags back against the edge of the
metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.

                    LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
              (indistinct above the roar of
               the station)
          Attention please.

          The Flyer now boarding at gate three. The
          Flyer now boarding at gate three.

Carol again raises her eyes. Still breathless, her face glows
with moisture.

INT. THE CLINTON'S BARN - (MORNING)

FRAN IS STILL SEATED ON THE STOOL. Rudy stares at her from
the cot. Harold is now absent.

                    FRAN
          I don't think you have to worry much
          about Harold. He won't do anything.

                    RUDY
              (he speaks very politely)
          That right?

                    FRAN
          You can trust him...

                    RUDY
          How long have you been married?

                       FRAN
          Two years.

                    RUDY
          Can he trust you?

                    FRAN
              (smiles)
          That's what matters, isn't it?

Rudy continues looking at her.

                    RUDY
          Come over here a minute...

He gestures with his gun. Fran crosses the distance slowly,
moving with apprehension.

                     FRAN
          Look, I'm not going to be any trouble to
          you either, fact is, this may sound
          funny, but maybe you and I could be close
          friends...

Rudy gestures her closer...




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             59.
CONTINUED:


                    FRAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          You don't always have to have your gun
          out. I'll get whatever you want. Really,
          I will...

Fran smiles. She is now standing over the cot, looking
directly down at Rudy. He jerks her down.

                    RUDY
              (still polite)
          Get rid of that nail polish, I don't like
          it, and when I tell you to come over here
          you move fast. You and I are going to get
          along because I've known a lot of people
          like you, so don't tell me about it
          because I got your ticket going in. Now
          get up and get that paint of your
          fingers... okay?

Rudy smiles.

INT. TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY

DOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of
lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes
in.

After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked
locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the
slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse.
Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station
is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move
carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make
themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.

THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between
the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long
corridor.

DOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed
off departure/arrival gates.

THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open
stairway winding downward.

DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area
where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the
loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't
surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps
behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or
two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and
starts back up the platform towards the concourse.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             60.
CONTINUED:

Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief
spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers
scurrying toward the awaiting train...

THE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the
boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the
pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach
passengers.

CAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of
about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight,
visible on the next level below.

THE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the
coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he
speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a
baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and
into the rail car passageway.

DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the
conductor and into the train.

THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the
forward compartments.

DOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and
disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car
vestibule.

ON THE CONCOURSE

CAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard
the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look
at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc.
She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will
take her down to trackside...

Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd
having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring
down at the shining train.

INT. FLYER - DAY COACH

THE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over
their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks,
clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to
move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried
but controlled pace.

                                                             61.



AT THE END OF A PULLMAN

DOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is
one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact
that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he
passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle.
She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an
overhead carriage.

Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her.

30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30?
empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a
run.

DOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR.
The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the
front of the train.

THE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER.
This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace,
swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of
the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move
into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by
the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds
only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.
The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,
hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are
tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.

DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still
unknowingly two cars behind the Thief.

THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE
SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries
the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks
the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind
him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the
smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door
swings open.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him,
crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window.
He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly
jammed...

DOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen
travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the
smoker.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                               62.
CONTINUED:


THE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a
PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes
through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and,
like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage
blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and
begins going back in the opposite direction.

DOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for
a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.

                       PORTER
                 (appearing suddenly at Doc's
                  shoulder)
             Be open five minutes out of the station.

Doc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps
toward his point of entrance onto the train.

THE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing
the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid
pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The
Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves
the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket.

DOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

THE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks
about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the
window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls
the shade lower.

EXT. TRACK

METAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS,
then begins to move forward.

THE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the
train edges forward. His body suddenly tightens. He sees Doc
outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of
moving passenger cars and several parked tinders.

                       THIEF'S POV
             DOC GLANCING BETWEEN PARKED PASSENGER
             CARS, walking cautiously ahead. As the
             Flyer continues to move slowly forward,
             Doc disappears from view.

THE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the
window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps
back out into the vestibule.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                             63.
CONTINUED:


AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a
window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair
opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well
behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered
about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of
the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch
tickets.

As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an
abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him.
He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the
paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief
rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then,
Doc sits down next to the Thief.

DOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE
THIEF'S NECK, pulling him close.

                    DOC
              (softly almost gently)
          When you pop a lock don't mark it.

The Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before
he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms.

THE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's
fingers are vise-like at his wrist.

THE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of
the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter.

THE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from
Doc and the Thief. He continues collecting and punching
fares.

INT. STATION GATE - DAY

CAROL IS EXITING. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE

LOUDSPEAKER -- the train has left.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR AS SEEN BY THE THIEF'S WIDENING EYES. He
methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two
seats ahead.

THE THIEF'S EYES BULGE AS DOC CHOPS HIM ON THE WINDPIPE. The
Thief goes out. Is he dead?

DOC CHOPS HIM AGAIN. IF HE ISN'T DEAD HE LOOKS IT.

Doc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head.

                                                            64.



INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL CROSSES INTO THE STATION, TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

Sits... waiting. The soldier comes by, stops. She doesn't
recognize anything.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR ARRIVES AT THE LOUNGE CHAIRS WHERE DOC AND THE
thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly
leaning in Doc's direction.

                     CONDUCTOR
          Tickets?

As Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it
to him.

                    DOC
          End of the line. Two.

                     CONDUCTOR
              (grumpily)
          All right.

The conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make
change.

THE THIEF SITS FACING THE WINDOW LOOKING VERY DEAD

INT. CLINTON'S FORD - DAY

RUDY SITS IN THE BACK SEAT AS HAROLD CAUTIOUSLY MOTORS

DOWN the highway. With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the
kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat.

                    RUDY
          Talk a little, Harold, loosen up... good
          for you.

Harold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel.

                    FRAN
              (chuckling at Harold)
          Something ought to loosen him up ... how
          comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?

                    RUDY
          I Just want to find a suitcase.

                                                             65.



INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON'S RANCH - DAY

BEYNON'S BODY REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT behind the overturned
kitchen table... a small trickle of blood oozes out from
under one of the table legs.

The Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring
down at Beynon's body.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          They may still be going to Nogales.

                    SWAIN
          What about Laughlin in El Paso?

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Cover both, get someone down there...
          either Rudy and McCoy's got half a
          million.

                    SWAIN
          They've got to switch cars.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Put out the word.

                    HAYHOE
              (looking back at Beynon)
          What about Jack?

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Tonight... take him out in the country,
          throw him down a dry well, if you can
          find one.

INT. PULLMAN CAR - DAY

AS DOC THUMBS IDLY THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER. He is suddenly
showered with spurting water. He lowers the paper and looks
to the aisle, seeing:

A SEVEN YEAR OLD BLACK PANTHER, dressed appropriately and
holding a water pistol.

                    KID
          Stick 'em up!

Doc looks at the brat.

                    KID (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          I'm gonna shoot you...


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            66.
CONTINUED:


He squeezes the pistol's trigger, two bursts of water land on
Doc's shirt front. Doc continues staring at the boy. The kid
looks hard at Doc, not giving an inch.

                    DOC
          Come here a second...

Doc takes the boy's arm, gently pulls him closer.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Look, I'm sure you're a nice kid and that
          your mother's nearby...

Now you better get back to her real quick or I'm going to
break your little arm... okay?

Doc releases the boy. The kid looks at Doc for a moment then
bursts into tears and retreats at a dead run back down the
passenger car aisleway. Doc again lifts the paper, turning to
the sports page.

INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL WAITS IN THE STATION. (A SERIES OP ANGLES AND
DISSOLVES)

INT. PULLMAN - DAY

DOC LIFTS THE SUITCASE AS THE CONDUCTOR APPEARS at the
vestibule at the opposite end of the car and announces the
next stop. Doc prepares to get off. The passenger car remains
sparsely populated. No one occupies the seats near the
corpse.

EXT. FIRST TRAIN CONCOURSE - SERIES OF ANGLES AND DISSOLVES -
EARLY MORNING

CAROL SITS WATCHING THE PEOPLE -- she gets up, doesn't know
where to go... sits down again... fear and anticipation on
her face... stands up... ready to go where? Ready to sit down
again, she looks up.

DOC CROSSES SLOWLY TO HER CARRYING THE SUITCASE. Carol
reacts... pleased to see him... pleased that he's back...
until.

                    DOC

                    CAROL
              (nailing him)
          I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get
          you out... I'll screw every prison
          official in Texas if I have to.

                    DOC
          Texas is a big state.

                    CAROL
          I can handle it.

                    DOC
          I'll bet you can.

                     CAROL
          You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you,
          Doc?
               (rising tone)
          If I was caught, wouldn't you?

Doc is silent. After a long pause.

                     CAROL (CONT'D)
              (continuing - quietly)
          When we had trouble before it was

                    CAROL
          What do you want to do?

                    DOC
          Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the
          money with you.

                    CAROL
          Do you mean that?

                       DOC
          I mean it.

A long pause. Maybe she wonders; what if he is lying but what
if he isn't? Temptation? She makes up her mind.

                    CAROL
          No... I don't want to leave.

                                                           68.



INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - EARLY EVENING

DOC AND CAROL WATCH THROUGH THE DOUBLE WINDOWS AS THE train
yard lights of a town go strobing by.

EXT. SECOND TRAIN CONCOURSE.

DOC AND CAROL COME DOWN OUT OF THE GANGWAY OF ANOTHER train
and turn up the pavement toward the main part of the depot.
Doc continues holding the suitcase as they walk.

                    DOC
          We'll grab a room for tonight then you go
          out tomorrow and buy yourself some new
          clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some
          food now, paper bag it, we eat in the
          room.

                    CAROL
              (cutting in)
          You've got all the answers. What about
          when they find the body on the train?

                    DOC
          When they find it, they find it.

To the cops a description's only good if there's a channel
for it, and there's no connection between that stiff and the
robbery.

                    CAROL
          You've got it all figured.

                    DOC

               about Beynon)
          No... there's a couple of things I'm
          still working on.

                       CAROL
          Like what?

But Doc doesn't answer.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

DOC LIES NEXT TO CAROL. Carol is eating a hamburger wrapped

panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping
passengers. His Mother catches him, takes him back to his
seat.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

CAROL IS BUSY UNBANDING THE MONEY PADS. A LARGE STACK OF
discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near
her leg. Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a
Texas newspaper.

CAROL CONTINUES TO LOOSEN THE GREENBACKS. She is surrounded
on the double bed by stacks of money. She lights a match,
drops it into the wastebasket. The money bands quickly burst
into flames, consume themselves, then die back into crinkly
ashes.

              (not looking up)
          There may be a hunting party.

                    CAROL
          Why, there's nothing on the news?

                    DOC
          I didn't mean police.

He continues thinking. Carol watches him for a moment.

                    CAROL
          Tell me about it.

Doc looks across at her.

                    DOC
              (calmly)
          Loredo is out. I've been thinking about
          Rudy. If he was on his own, we're okay.
          If Beynon bought him out...

Doc looks at her.

                    CAROL
          What?

          If Beynon bought him out, and he talked
          then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting
          for us in El Paso.

Rudy knew about Laughlins.

                    CAROL
          You're full of ifs.

                    DOC
          I think you liked it with him.

I think he got to you.

                    CAROL
          Maybe. At least I got to him.

INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT

A WATER PISTOL APPEARS AROUND THE CORNER   OF AN EMPTY
PASSENGER CHAIR. The seven year old brat   squeezes off several
plumes of water. The Thief is hit by the   gun's spray, water
runs slowly down his ear and the back of   his neck.

                     KID
          Bang!

THE BOY WATCHES THE IMMOBILE MAN. He fires again, once again
there is no reaction. The brat steps forward... smiling, he
pushes the thief's arm, pushes harder.

THE THIEF'S BODY SUDDENLY FALLS BACK ACROSS THE CHAIR. His
eyes roll upward... staring at the panther. His neck is
bruised, he pushes his hat back slowly.

                    THIEF
              (very hoarsely)
          Get me a doctor.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

CAROL SLEEPS ON HER STOMACH, her head resting across one arm.
Doc lies beside her, eyes open. He looks over at Carol a
moment, noting the long strands of hair that move
rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing. After
a moment Doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and
stares at the black suitcase.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

He opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks
into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn
shade. Still holding the money, Doc looks back at Carol.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER HOLDS A SIMILAR MONEY PAD with his
handkerchief. The Panther is sitting with his mother on a
nearby seat. Still dressed in his panther suit, but no longer
a brat. His face reflects both fear and shock.

THE THIEF IS WITH THEM, BANDAGED AROUND THE THROAT

                    PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER
              (to the Thief)
          Where did you get it?

                    THIEF
              (hoarsely)
          It was a gift.

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

CAROL COMES IN. SHE IS WEARING A NEW SUIT, SANDALS It looks
great... She tosses a package on the bed.

Doc looks at her outfit and opens his. They are too flashy.

                    DOC
          Thanks.
              (as Carol starts to speak)
          You look great, just great...

They could pick you up for soliciting in ten minutes.

                    CAROL
          That would be the first time.

                    DOC
              (angry)
          When are you going to learn?

                    CAROL

              (laughing)
          And that could be all for you., baby.

Carol suddenly angered slaps him.

Doc immediately delivers her a stinging blow.

Carol hits the wall then stands stunned as he quietly ties
his laces and pulls on his jacket. Doc stuffs the Colt .45
into the flapped outside pocket along with 2 clips. He turns
to the bed and picks up the suitcase.

Carol continues looking at Doc.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          Now you learn3 this time it could be the
          chair for both of us.

Carol starts to speak.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          From now on you just shut up and do as
          you're told.

                    CAROL
          If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would
          have.

Doc doesn't answer. He turns and exits. She follows.

RUDY REACHES OVER TO THE NIGHTSTAND AND SHUTS OFF the radio.
His eyes stare vacantly ahead for a moment.

HAROLD CLINTON IS TIED SECURELY INTO A CHAIR, his mouth
tightly gagged.

RUDY BEGINS TO SMILE. FRAN IS NEXT TO RUDY WITHIN THE bed,
wearing only a bra, sleeping, one arm wrapped around Rudy's
middle.

                    RUDY
          How you doing over there, Harold? You
          sleep okay last night? Good. I'm glad to
          hear it. Did you listen to the news? That
          means we don't have to drive so hard
          today, Harold... we're gonna be
          travelling a lot faster than they are...
          We got a lot more time than I figured.

inside the bra. Fran half awakens, pulls herself closer to
Rudy.

INT. LAUGHLIN HOTEL - EL PASO - MORNING

CANNON (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen
before) ENTERS THE DARK NEARLY DESERTED LOBBY and approaches
the reception desk. The large room is populated by
overstuffed and threadbare furniture.

LAUGHLIN looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish
just about as badly. He flashes a quick grin from behind the
counter as Cannon draws near. At the switchboard behind
Laughlin, CARMEN, maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks
(all of them idle) readinc a movie magazine.

                    CANNON
          You Laughlin?

                    LAUGHLIN
              (Mr. Friendly)
          Yes, sir, and that's my wife and that's
          Junior.

Laughlin indicates a seventeen year old BELLBOY sleeping in
one of the overstuffed chairs.

                    CANNON
          Congratulations. I need a room.

                    LAUGHLIN
          No trouble. You came to the right place,
          one thing we got is a lot of rooms. What
          else can I do for you?

                                                             75.



INT. DOC AND CAROL'S CAR - DAY

AS IT MOTORS DOWN THE TEXAS HIGHWAY. The black suitcase is
propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat. Doc,
seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his
hand. The radio is obviously not working as he turns the
dials and pushes the buttons.

                    DOC
              (cajoling it)
          C'mon workl I
              (almost pleading)
          C'mon.

We hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc... and then
the radio conks out again. This time Doc hits the radio hard.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (angrily to the radio)
          Give me the news!!

When it is clear that the radio won't work:

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          You can't trust anything these days.

                    CAROL
          I'll tell you something, Doc. One day
          you're going to have to trust somebody...

DOC SLAMS THE BRAKE, GRABS THE WHEEL as the car veers over to
the side of the road.

                     DOC
          I trust...
              (he opens the black suitcase)
          Want to see what I trust... In God we
          trust...
              (he pulls out a bill and points
               at it)
          The word's on every bill!!!

                    CAROL
              (slamming the suitcase closed)
          You keep it up and it won't matter how
          far we get away, because it's going to be
          all over between you and me. Do you
          understand that? There won't be anything
          left.

She starts the car up again, and continues driving, her
knuckles tightening around the steering wheel.

                                                          76.



INT. CLINTON'S FORD - ANGLES - DAY

AS IT LEISURELY MOVES ALONG THE ROADWAY BORDERED BY MILES OF
SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat
beside her husband... a scrunched up sack of food beside her.
She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper
bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in
the back, eating spareribs. He suddenly throws a just
finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder.

                    RUDY
          Have a bone, baby.

He throws another sparerib at Fran.

                    FRAN
              (shouts)
          Oh, Christ, you wrecked my blouse.

God damn it, Rudy, what did you do that for? Jesus.

                     RUDY
              (laughing)
          I'll tell you why I did it... it makes me
          feel good.

He laughs and again throws another bone at Fran. She suddenly
catches his mood and begins laughing herself ... tossing a
bone back at Rudy.

HAROLD CONTINUES DRIVING. His knuckles whiten around the
steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front
of him.

THE KITTEN IS SLEEPING WITHIN the cardboard box, oblivious to
Rudy and Fran's laughter. (That will be the day.)

EXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY

THE CHEVY MOVES ALONG with the light mid-day traffic, passing
various roadside business establishments, then pulls up
before a radio/TV repair and sales shop.

INT. RADIO/TV STORE - DAY

ALL THE LATEST MODEL RADIOS are stacked on shelves around the
small room... a television display featuring several models
is in one corner of the shop. Another TV is playing near the
counter and the PROPRIETOR'S desk.

                    DOC
          Yeah.

The Proprietor moves to a shelf.

THE SCREEN. As Doc's picture suddenly flashes onto the tube,
with appropriate dialogue.

DOC STARING AT THE TELEVISION, then he quickly reaches over
and snaps the set off.

THE PROPRIETOR BRINGS OUT SOME RADIOS, seemingly oblivious to
Doc's action.

                    PROPRIETOR
          15 to 55 dollars -- take your pick.

DOC TURNS, then looks at the corner of the small shop.

ALL THE TELEVISION SETS have Doc's picture on them.

DOC TURNS BACK TO THE PROPRIETOR -- the man is looking at him
not at the sets.

                    DOC
              (paying)
          Fifty --

Taking a set, he exits.

                    PROPRIETOR
          You have change.

But he doesn't answer.

INT. CAR - DAY

CAROL TURNS AS DOC STICKS HIS HEAD through the open door,
hands her the set.

                    DOC
          We got trouble. Let's take a walk.

DOC AND CAROL WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK OP THE SMALL TOWN. They
turn into a Sporting Goods Store. The Chevy is behind them, a
block away.

                                                             78.



INT. RADIO/TV STORE

THE PROPRIETOR LOOKS CAREFULLY OUT THE WINDOW AT THE empty
car, then turns and grabs his telephone.

INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE

CAROL REMAINS BY THE FRONT WINDOW, PRETENDING TO

EXAMINE some fishing equipment as she keeps her eye on the
street.

Doc moves to the counter at the rear of the store. An
ATTENDANT moves up to help Doc.

                    SALESMAN
              (with a smile)
          Can I help you?

                    DOC
          Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge
          pump with the twenty-inch barrel.

                    SALESMAN
          All right. Shells?

                    DOC
          Two boxes of double-ought buck.

                    SALESMAN
          Gonna knock down a wall?

                    DOC
              (big smile)
          Might try that.

The Salesman puts a form in front of Doc then goes to the gun
rack behind him, lifts off a short-barreled shotgun and
begins to wrap it.

                       SALESMAN
          Sign here.

CAROL, AT THE FRONT OP THE STORE, WATCHES THE STREET INTENTLY

EXT. THE STREET

THE RADIO-REPAIRMAN EXITS THE SHOP AS A POLICE CAR comes down
the street and makes a U-turn... stopping near the Chevy.
After a brief conversation the Radio-Repairman goes back
inside his store and the police car pulls forward, down the
street from the Chevy.

                                                             79.



INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO COPS LOOK LIKE HOMER AND JETHRO. Both men stare hard
at the now staked-out Chevy.

CAROL -- WATCHING PROM THE WINDOW OP THE SPORTING GOODS STORE

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN LAYS OUT THE GUN AND THE BOXES OF
SHELLS. As Doc empties the loose shells into his coat pocket:

CAROL TURNS, LOOKS AT DOC, THEIR EYES MEET. Doc reads her; he
knows that the police are in the street.

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN PUTS A STRING AROUND THE BROWN
PAPER

                    SALESMAN
          Be one hundred and eighty-five thirty-
          two.

Doc quickly pays the man.

                    DOC
          Much obliged.

Doc turns as the Salesman drifts over to another Customer --
he approaches Carol at the store window.

                    CAROL
          Only one car.

                    DOC
          Let's do it.

Carol moves ahead of Doc,, exits the Sporting Goods Store and
starts up the sidewalk.

DOC WATCHES HER FOR A MOMENT, THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR HIMSELF

EXT. SIDEWALK

CAROL WALKS ALONE BACK TOWARDS THE CAR.

INT. POLICE CAR

HOMER AND JETHRO CONTINUE STARING AT THE CHEW. Their car is
pointed towards the Radio Store, its back to the Sporting
Goods house.

DOC LEAVES THE SPORTING GOODS STORE, CROSSES THE STREET and
begins walking up the opposite sidewalk, back towards the
Chevy.

                                                             80.



CAROL PASSES THE POLICE CAR AND NEARS THE CHEVY

INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO RURAL COPS MOVE INTO ACTION; their car pulls forward
and parks diagonally across the street, partially blocking
the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the Chevy.

CAROL STANDS FROZEN AS HOMER AND JETHRO HOP OUT OF THE POLICE
car, guns drawn.

DOC CROSSES THE STREET BEHIND THE COP CAR

HE LEVELS HIS big gun...

Doc FIRES the shotgun through the "brown wrapping paper point
blank into the squad car, caving in one side of the machine
and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck.

Homer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as
their car EXPLODES behind them.

With three more BLASTS Doc blows most of the top off the
police car then calmly reloads.

                    DOC
          Slide those guns!

The two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement.

CAROL HAS INSTANTLY MOVED BACK INTO THE CHEVY, started the
engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street. She
makes a U-turn, then pulls up near Doc.

DOC STEPS FORWARD, KICKS THE TWO PISTOLS BACK UNDER the
police car near the gas tank.

He walks to the back of the car.

Carol throws open the passenger door of the Chevy.

Doc SHOOTS the gas tank of the squad car, it instantly
ignites.

Walking calmly around the burning police car Doc then starts
to climb into the Chevy.

Carol REVS the engine.

Doc pauses a moment, looking back at the prone police
officers and the blazing automobile.

CONTINUED:


Carol guns the car forward -- Doc, unprepared for the Chevy's
sudden movement, falls flat on his face across the pavement.

CAROL THROWS THE CHEVY INTO REVERSE, AND ROARS back to pick
up Doc.

DOC, A LITTLE CHAGRINED, PICKS HIMSELF UP, GRABS his gun and
jumps into the Chevy. He slams the door closed, Carol again
tears forward -- tires peeling down the pavement.

HOMER AND JETHRO RAISE THEMSELVES. With very long faces they
study the burning remains of their once proud squad car.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY SPEEDS OUT OF TOWN,, onto an open stretch of road.

INT. CHEVY

DOC JAMS ONE MORE SHELL INTO HIS PAPER-WRAPPED gun -- Carol
grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road... the
Chevy continues to accelerate.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY CROSSES THE ROAD'S BROKEN WHITE LINE and passes a
lumbering Greyhound bus.

DOC, STARING AT THE HIGHWAY BEHIND THEM; the bus fades off
into the horizon...

                       DOC
                 (finally)
             Here.

THE CHEVY PULLS OFF THE HIGHWAY, MOVES UP A DIRT road for
twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out
farm, smashing through the six foot high stalks. Well out of
sight, the Chevy slams to an abrupt halt.

DOC AND CAROL, RUNNING THROUGH THE CORNFIELD AND BACK UP THE
DIRT road toward the highway. Doc still carries his gun in
the brown wrapping paper. Carol labors with the suitcase as
she runs.

ON THE HIGHWAY DOC STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, waving
both arms overhead. The Greyhound bus comes to a lurching
halt, Doc and Carol scramble aboard.

INT. BUS

DOC BUYS TWO FARES FROM THE SCOWLING GREYHOUND DRIVER. The
bus again moves forward.

DOC AND CAROL SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BUS, Doc hold- 4l4 ing
his camouflaged gun. They lean back on their padded seats as
the bus jostles along the road.

Suddenly... Two Police Cars pass the bus, SIRENS screaming,
lights turning...

Doc and Carol's eyes meet...

One more Black and White passes the bus and races on down the
road.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TEXAS TOWN - AFTERNOON 4L

DOC WEARS A SUNBEATEN LEATHER JACKET, READING A NEWSPAPER,
while leaning against a hot dog stand. One foot rests on the
suitcase. The Invicta has been re-wrapped in a laundry bag.
The paper is filled with news of the robbery and a mug shot
of Doc.

A GREY MERCURY PULLS UP NEAR THE DOGGIE DINER. Carol is
driving. Doc walks up to the window of the car.

INT. MERCURY

DOC LEANS IN THROUGH THE WINDOW.

                    DOC
          Where are you going?

                      CAROL
          El Paso.

Doc opens the door and moves into the driver's seat.

                      DOC
          How much?

                    CAROL
          Twenty eight hundred.

As she looks at him, he smiles:

                    DOC
          Are you hungry?

                      CAROL
          Not now.

He drives off.

          I've got to stop.

                    RUDY
              (as Fran!s hands move over him)
          I'll tell you when.

EXT. HIGHWAY - TEXAS - MIDNIGHT 4L

A FRONTAGE ROAD BORDERING THE EDGE OF A GOOD-SIZED TOWN.
Carol now driving,, pulls off the highway and into an "Oasis"
drive-in restaurant.

THE MERCURY COMES TO A STOP WITHIN A ROW OF CARS FACING the
indoor portion of the restaurant.

DOC AND CAROL - INSIDE THEIR AUTOMOBILE AS THE CAR HOP - a
skinny girl, wearing a brown jacket and slacks, approaches
the car carrying two menus. She arrives with a smile. Doc
leans forward, looking past Carol at the waitress, he lifts
his hand, not accepting the bill of fare.

                    DOC
          That's okay, honey. Two cheeseburgers;
          two coffees and a milkshake.

                    GIRL
          How about fries?

                    DOC
              (big smile)
          Why not?

The Car Hop walks back across the raised cement sidewalk
towards the kitchen area...

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

HAROLD IS TIED TO A CHAIR, RUDY IS LYING ON THE BED, half-
clothed, eating chicken, drinking a beer, while Fran slowly
strips down to bra and panties.

INT. MERCURY AT THE DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT

DOC AND CAROL WATCH AS THE CAR HOP PREPARES to bolt the
serving tray onto the car-door window.

                    GIRL
          Could you roll it up part way?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    CAROL
          Sure thing.

The girl clamps the tray to the window. The Car Hop narrows
her features, looking at Doc and Carol then smiles and turns
and heads back toward the kitchen.

DOC REACHES UP AND CASUALLY ADJUSTS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

THE MIRROR HAS BEEN TURNED TO REVEAL THE HIGHWAY AND THE
ENTRANCE TO THE DRIVE-IN'S PARKING LOT

CAROL BEGINS TO EAT, she looks casually at the mirror.

DOC SLOWLY EATS HIS CHEESEBURGER, TAKES A SIP OF MILKSHAKE

CAROL REACHES FOR HER COFFEE, spills it and then reaches for
the light switch knob on the dashboard.

THE MERCURY'S HEADLIGHTS BLINK ON

THE CAR HOP AT THE PICK-UP STAND, notes the lights 429 then
turns her head the opposite direction, pretending not to see.

DOC WATCHES THE WAITRESS TURN AWAY

THE CAR HOP STARES AT THE CEMENT PAVEMENT. Within the kitchen
behind her the cooks all look toward the parking lot... their
faces expectant.

DOC WATCHING THE WAITRESS

                    DOC
          She made us.

Carol looks into the rear view mirror. Across the wide lot a
police car appears, cutting in off the highway.

Doc goes into the back seat, Carol kicks the engine over,
jams the stick into gear. All this is accomplished while
staring into the rear view mirror.

DOC LIFTS THE LAUNDRY BAG-COVERED SHOTGUN onto his lap.

THE POLICE CAR cruises slowly along the line of autos...

INT. POLICE CAR

TWO OFFICERS SCAN THE PARKING LOT. THE PASSENGER COP CRADLES
a riot gun.

                     PASSENGER COP
          Mercury.

CONTINUED:


THE SQUAD CAR PULLS TO A STOP FIFTEEN FEET behind the
Mercury, seemingly blocking the way.

                    DOC
          Now.

CAROL STANDS ON THE ACCELERATOR. THE MERCURY GOES screaming
forward, as Doc shoots out the back window. Then, as the
terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front
windshield. The Mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the
empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll
across the concrete. The car slams back down through a vacant
space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle
across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit.

DOC SMASHES OUT THE REAR WINDOW with the butt of his shotgun.

THE BLACK AND WHITE NOW IN REVERSE, ZOOMING BACK, trying to
get between the Mercury and the highway.

CAROL BRINGING THE CAR AROUND, SHE CAN SEE THE SQUAD CAR
streaking backward. She pulls the wheel to the right and
brings her car across the front of the still stopping Police
Car.

THE OFFICERS TRY TO BRING THEIR GUNS INTO PLAY AS THE Mercury
streaks in front of them.

DOC FIRES THE SHOTGUN TWICE

THE POLICE CAR EXPLODES. THE HOOD IS LIFTED OFF THE CAR. Both
Officers jump out of the vehicle, pouring shots after the
retreating Mercury.

CAROL - SCREAMING AS THE FRONT AND BACK WINDSHIELDS SHATTER
around her.

THE MERCURY, BADLY RIDDLED, PULLS OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY

ANOTHER SQUAD CAR COMES SPEEDING UP in the opposite
direction. The Driver hits the brakes, the tires smoke along
the street as the Black and White SCREAMS to a stop.

CAROL PULLS THE MERCURY BY THE SQUAD CAR

DOC FIRES ANOTHER TWO BURSTS...

THE POLICE CAR - THE FRONT AND BACK FENDERS ARE HIT; the
wheels disintegrate - the impact of the shells rocks the
Black and White upward.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             86.
CONTINUED:


THE SECOND PASSENGER COP, FIRING A .38 OUT HIS BACK WINDOW at
the Mercury as it streaks down the road. Three holes open up
on the trunk of the auto.

DOC CAN SEE BOTH OFFICERS JUMP OUT OF THE SECOND Black and
White through the rear window. Carol makes a quick turn off
the highway.

THE MERCURY ROARS DOWN THE DARK STREET INTO THE CITY'S
COMMERCIAL SECTION, suddenly slow, makes another sharp turn -
this time through a red light.

DOWN A SMALLER STREET FILLED WITH SHOPS - CAROL ROUNDS THE
CORNER, whips up to the curb - Doc and Carol jump out of the
car. She carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun.

DOC AND CAROL, MOVING DOWN A DESERTED SIDEWALK; the SOUND of
sirens. They round a corner, then quickly move into an alley.

THE ALLEY IS NARROW, DESERTED. DOC AND CAROL pull back into
an alcove as a prowl car goes SCREAMING down the street and
off into the night. They continue down the alley.

THE OPPOSITE ENTRANCE TO THE ALLEY IS BLOCKED BY a large
metal garbage container, and the DRIVER empties two cans of
garbage into it. Then he starts across the narrow street
beyond in order to grab several others.

DOC LOOKS BEHIND HIM, THEN GRABS CAROL'S ARM. They run for
the container. Doc tosses the suitcase into the container,
jumps in, reaches back, pulls Carol in beside him. SIRENS
again sound close by.

AFTER A MOMENT, A LARGE GARBAGE TRUCK PULLS UP, lifts the
container with hooks and dumps the garbage and Doc and Carol
into the truck.

A SERIES OP ANGLES AS A CRUSHER BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARDS THEM
INSIDE THE TRUCK. Doc and Carol start to panic, but they have
room enough.

WITHIN THE TRUCK DOC WIGGLES HIS .45 out of his jacket and
into his hand. He, Carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly
amongst the garbage. A moment after Doc frees his gun, a load
of garbage descends on their shelter, partially obscuring
them.

THE TRUCK PULLS OUT

DOC AND CAROL SWEATING... BREATHING HARD. Again the SOUND of
sirens... the truck lurches forward.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

THE TRUCK MOVES ALONG THE EMPTY STREETS, passing several
prowling squad cars.

EXT. STREETS - SERIES OF ANGLES - SUNRISE

THE GARBAGE MAN DRIVING THE TRUCK, MAKING STOPS, throwing in
more refuse. The truck continues along.

DOC AND CAROL - THEIR FACES COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION and
flies... buried within their enclosure under the moist
garbage.

A GARBAGE DUMP - MORNING

THE TRUCK GROWLS ALONG THE RUTTED PATHWAY surrounded by acres
of open trash. Areas within the dump reveal the slow,
smouldering fires...

THE TRUCK BACKS UP TO A HUGE CRATER HALF-FILLED WITH REFUSE

THE DRIVER REVS THE ENGINE, PULLS THE BED LIFT GEAR

THE TRUCK BED RISES AND TILTS FORWARD, as the load of trash
tumbles down the face of the crater.

DOC AND CAROL SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF FILTH, and stumbling
forward they climb into a large cardboard box.

THE DRIVER GETS OUT OF THE CAB, checks to see that the
garbage is gone from the truck bed. On his way back to the
cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto
tire. With his newly-found prize, the Driver re-enters the
truck and drives away.

THE BOX LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER AMONGST the broken
bottles, melon rinds, flashlight batteries, tin cans, used
tires.

DOC SAWS AT A CORNER OF THE CARDBOARD BOX with his penknife.
The matted paper gives away, allowing them more room within
the box.

                    DOC
          Okay?

                    CAROL
          I think so... I don't know.

Doc puts his hand to her face, wiping away a thin trace of
blood from a scratch.

                    DOC
          It's not deep.

          No scars?

                       DOC
          No scars.

Doc looks across the garbage through the open end of the
crate.

THE HEAT AND THE FLIES HAVE BECOME UNBEARABLE. Carol begins
to scratch her leg.

                     DOC (CONT'D)
          Don't scratch it, just rub, you'll get an
          infection.

Carol ignores him, she is in bad shape.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Do what I tell you, it's not a game.

                    CAROL
          It's all a game, don't bother me.

Doc stares at the garbage around them.

                    DOC
          We better stick here till tonight.

                       CAROL
              (down)
          Yeah.

Doc smiles, trying to get her to smile again.

                    DOC
          We're going to make it.

                    CAROL
              (further down)
          Sure...

Carol rubs one hand along her now terribly soiled, tweed
suit.

She looks away from Doc. Doc stares at her mussed hair and
tear-stained cheeks.

                    DOC
          I want to say something.

                     DOC
               (softly)
           Listen to me. It's hard enough.

Carol turns back, faces Doc. Their eyes find one another.

                     DOC (CONT'D)
               (continuing)
           Look, what you said yesterday... I guess
           that was right. It isn't worth anything
           if we don't make it together.

                     CAROL
           I don't think we can any more... If we
           ever get out of here, maybe I should take
           off...

                     CAROL

           close to anything.

                     DOC
           I guess you're right.

A pause.

                     CAROL
           I always thought jails make people hard.
           Not you. You're just not tough enough to
           forget about Beynon. I chose you, not
           him.

They pull each other closer, tightly holding one another.

                    LAUGHLIN
          It's hard to figure. There's something
          about the composition of the track at
          Pimlico... You can't go by the clock, any
          speed horse, take a second off any other

AS THE GROUP ENTERS.

                    LAUGHLIN
              (continuing)
          ... but a speed horse is the only thing
          that consistently holds form. They got to
          let 'em run, dumb God damn trainers try
          to rate 'em, just breaks their heart.

Rudy kicks the door shut with a slam, grabs Laughlin's
shoulder, spins him around, hits him full in the stomach. As
Laughlin begins to fall Rudy catches him, wallops him again
in the mid-section, then throws him back into a ratty
armchair. Rudy instantly pulls out his .44 and shoves it hard
against Laughlin's mouth.

                    RUDY
          Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices. Live
          or die.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
          Do what I tell you, you not only get to
          live, but maybe you'll pick up some
          money.

                    LAUGHLIN
              (still breathless)
          Just tell me.

                    RUDY
          First things first. Main thing, you work

Doc gives Laughlin a half-pissed look, then crosses to the
elevator and pulls the cage door open.

LAUGHLIN WATCHES THE RICKETY, self-service elevator move
upward. He reaches for the desk phone.

INT. ROOM 4L8 - DAY

FRAN, WEARING ONLY A BATHROBE, is doing her nails while
watching an old movie on the black and white tube, seated on
the bed. The phone begins to RING.

Fran looks over to Rudy from her overstuffed armchair.

                    RUDY
          Okay, Grunt, pick it up.

ELEVATOR DOORS - THIRD FLOOR

CAROL EMERGES THROUGH THE SLIDING DOOR AND TURNS DOWN THE
CORRIDOR. She walks slowly, carrying the heavy suitcase.
Reaching the door to room 31oj Carol knocks rapidly three
times, waits, then raps out two sets of two knocks. The door
swings open and Doc stands within the archway. She enters.
Doc shuts the door and slips his arms around Carol, revealing
his .45 automatic in one hand.

INT. RUDY'S HOTEL ROOM

RUDY IS SPINNING THE CHAMBER on his .44 then shoves it into
his coat pocket. Fran is getting dressed in the middle of the
room, her breasts and thighs ripple outward from the confines
of the bra and girdle.

THE CALICO KITTEN SLEEPS PEACEFULLY IN ITS cardboard box.

                                                              95.



INT. BATHROOM 3L8

CAROL IS IN THE SHOWER, STEAM HANGS IN THE AIR as she
vigorously soaps her body, cleansing herself of the residue
left from their cross-country flight.

DOC IN THE MAIN ROOM IS STANDING AT THE LARGE windows facing
across to the building next to Laughlins. The fire escape is
one story beneath him. Doc crosses, throws the suitcase on
the bed, undoes the straps and snaps, lifts the lid open. He
stares at the huge amount of money for a moment, then digs
into the suitcase, reaching down to the bottom. He withdraws
his hand, holding four visas.. He puts two of them on the
bureau drawer top... the other two he begins to tear into
sections and places them into a large ashtray. He touches a
match to the scraps.

THE FLAMES CURL AROUND RUDY'S PHOTOGRAPH in the ashtray.

ON THE BED IN DOC AND CAROL'S ROOM, THE SUITCASE IS NOW
CLOSED; the .45 automatic sits beside it... Doc's overcoat
also lies across the bedpsread, near it the wrapped shotgun.
The poster is again on the wall.

CAROL still in the bathroom of room 318. She wears only a
slip. Carol is washing out her bra and panties in the
washbasin, using a coarse bar of soap. Doc enters; he begins
taking off his shirt.

INT. BEDROOM 318

CAROL STILL WEARING THE SLIP, she lies back across the bed.
Her eyelids slowly fall shut. Carol has pushed the suitcase,
overcoat and .45 off to one side.

RUDY AND FRAN COME DOWN THE STAIRS. Rudy puts one hand inside
his overcoat.

She is interrupted by a hard knock on the door. Doc drops his

Doc gestures to Carol... she moves towards the door.

              (continuing; now at doorway)
          Who is it?

INT. HALLWAY

Fran stands at the door to 318. Rudy is at her shoulder; he
has taken out his revolver.

                    FRAN
          It's your food, I brought up your
          sandwiches...

                    INSIDE 318
          Carol standing near the door., looks at
          Doc. He mouths and half-whispers:

                    DOC
          Stall.

Doc whips his pen knife out of his pocket, crosses the room
to the locked door of an adjoining hotel room. He begins
forcing the lock.

                    CAROL
          Just leave it outside the door... I'm not
          dressed right now.

After a moment:

                    FRAN
          I can't do that, ma'am. You have to pay
          now so I can pay back the boy that went
          out and got the food...

DOC working on the door; his .45 shoved into the waistband of
his pants.

CAROL thinking hard...

                    CAROL
          All right. You'll have to hold on a
          minute, my husband's in the shower...

DOC breaks the lock and opens the door -- he quickly crosses
the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his
automatic, then gingerly cracks the door. His eyes tighten in
amazement as he sees:

RUDY STANDING SLIGHTLY BEHIND FRAN, his .44 held tightly up
to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use. Rudy and Fran
are 15 feet down the hallway from Doc's slightly opened door.
They both have their backs turned to him in three-quarter
fashion.

DOC BAREFOOTED., BARE-CHESTED; he decides on a course of
action. The door swings quietly open.

WITHIN THE HALLWAY, DOC CLOSES THE DISTANCE between himself
and Rudy in two swift strides, Rudy turns,, swinging his gun,
too late, as Doc's .45 crashes against his head. Rudy drops.
Fran screams. Rudy looks at Doc, still smiling, eyes glazed.

He falls abruptly. Doc stands over the fallen body. Fran
continues to scream. Doc finally turns away from Rudy,
looking now at the screaming woman. He flattens her with a
left hook to the jaw. Fran drops to the floor as if she had
been shot. Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent.

RUDY'S HEAD IS BLOODIED. He lies without movement.

DOC NOW SLAMS AT THE DOOR OF 318

                    DOC
          Open it up, it's me.

Carol swings the door open. Doc bursts back into the room,
grabs his shirt, begins to button it.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Come on, come on.

          Just get your clothes on...

THE FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

AS DOC AND CAROL COME BACK OUT OF 318 they step over the
fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator.

Carol stops as she recognizes Rudy. Doc pulls her along,
forcing her to keep moving. Carol again carries the brown
suitcase, Doc holds the shotgun. They go down the back (or
front) stairs.

                                                           100.



INT. LOBBY

THE ACCOUNTANT STANDS AT ONE CORNER OP THE RECEPTION COUNTER
IN THE LOBBY OF LAUGHLINS. Within an alcove behind and to one
side of the desk (the area serving as an office) Cully, Swain
and Hayhoe have stretched Laughlin across the pine desk. The
Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the
hotel3 acting as lookout.

CULLY INSIDE THE ALCOVE LIFTS A SNAPPED OFF LEG of the heavy
chair to use as a club. The thug turns back to the desk where
Swain and Hayhoe have Laughlin pinioned.

                       CULLY
             Just tell us the room number.

LAUGHLIN LOOKS BACK AT CULLY. He is very frightened but says
nothing.

CULLY SLAMS THE WOODEN CLUB DOWN ON LAUGHLIN KNEECAP

                       CULLY
             Now you want to tell me?

                       LAUGHLIN
             McCoy's in 318., the other guy's in 420.

                       CULLY
             Sure about that?

He again whacks Laughlin's knee.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS

DOC AND CAROL EMERGE,, MOVING QUICKLY FOR THE. main entrance.
They get five steps before simultaneously seeing the
Accountant.

                       CAROL
             Doc !

Doc and Carol freeze for an instant.

The Accountant snaps his fingers twice.

Cully lowers his club, looks to the Accountant, as do Swain
and Hayhoe. The Accountant smiles, staring at Doc and Carol.

                       ACCOUNTANT
                 (calmly to his men)
             Out here.

CONTINUED:


CULLY, SWAIN AND HAYHOE APPEAR FROM THE ALCOVE BEHIND the
Accountant. They look over his shoulder toward the rear of
the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol.

INT. WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY

DOC HAS ONE HAND IN HIS OUTSIDE COAT POCKET, WRAPPED

around the .45. Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in
front of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between
Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut
off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk.
Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden
staircase.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Just have her set it down.

Doc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture
revealing that his palm is empty.

                    DOC
          You want it? Come and take it.

THE ACCOUNTANT NOW PLANKED BY THE THREE MEN

                    ACCOUNTANT
              (quietly)
          Get him.

As the three men reach for their guns.

DOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the
disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The
reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast
and he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from
the sudden burst of fire power.

DOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS

HAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another
shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor
at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon,
Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover. They
miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring.

ON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She
struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun
to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with
his right.

                                                         102.



WITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES

Cully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull
the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max
start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol.
All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their
hands.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the
first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of
Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard.

HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly
up and fires.

DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as
Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister
supports.

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow
indicator pass "Two."

DOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two
shots back down the stairwell.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly
Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the
other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder.

SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver
straight up... empties it.

DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls
Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell
with a huge roar.

THE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's
blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to
continue moving upward. Cannon following.

THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT "THREE"

CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The
Accountant remains within the elevator.

SWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD

CAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs
ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing,
keep moving upwards towards the third.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           103.
CONTINUED:


Doc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and
Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware
of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces.

RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE
DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly
wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs
violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up
his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's
room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door.

CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five
steps behind.

DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT

SWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR

Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He
moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the
distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within
the elevator.

Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The
SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses
a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As
Carol screams:

Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane
of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45
in his right.

CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds
fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed
by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of
their mark.

DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE

THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the
riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The
plaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are
smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward.

THE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT

THE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley
housing. The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car.

WITHIN THE LOBBY

                                                           104.



AS THE ELEVATOR SLAMS TO A WRENCHING STOP FIVE FEET

ABOVE the floor level. The Accountant bounces from the floor
of the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor.

Laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain. He
sees the suspended car through the iron grill door.

The Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the
elevator. His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle.

DOC ON THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING

HE JAMS SEVERAL SHELLS INTO HIS RIOT GUN WHILE HOLDING his
.45 ready for an appearance by Swain. Reloading completed, he
stands, with Carol. He again begins to move upward.

SWAIN FIRES FROM THE STAIRWELL

DOC STOPS, SETS BOTH THE RIOT GUN AND THE .45 on 562 the
banister... He waits... on the winding staircase below him
there is a dark movement.

DOC FIRES BOTH GUNS

THE STAIRWELL AROUND SWAIN DISINTEGRATES. The thug is
obliterated by the firepower.

DOC CANNOT SEE THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOTS. He again resumes his
flight upward.

INT. DOC'S BATHROOM

RUDY HOLDS HIS BLOODY HEAD IN THE SINK BOWL, DUMBLY splashing
water over himself. Carol's underwear is still present.
Rudy's pistol lies on the soap tray.

THE LANDING AS DOC AND CAROL COME POUNDING INTO VIEW. No
further avenues open, they turn down the corridor. Doc grabs
Carol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the
door shut.

INT. THE ROOM

DOC GRABS THE SUITCASE, RUNS TO THE WINDOW, TEARS off the
shade, lifts the frame, looks. The drop is too far. He grabs
Carol and runs into the hallway.

INT. CORRIDOR

THEY RUN DOWN TWO DOORS AND BREAK IN. Over the door is the
sign "Fire Escape."

                                                         105.



INT. FIRE ESCAPE ROOM

DOC HELPS CAROL OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE. He aids her with
his left hand, the riot gun now clutched tightly in his
right. He motions, she hands him the suitcase and follows.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

THEY DESCEND THE FIRE ESCAPE. They reach the end. The fire
escape stays rigid.

Doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps. He turns and
with the suitcase crosses to the end. Throws the bag and the
shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall,
preparing to jump.

RUDY COMES OUT OF THE ROOM ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE holding his
.44. He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun. Carol
screams.

DOC JUMPS. RUDY FIRES. DOC IS HIT IN THE SIDE (flesh wound).
In the air he spins and lands. Rudy fires again and again as
he runs down the fire escape. Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun
and fires.

RUDY'S TIME HAS COME. THE JUMBO CHARGES MASH HIM BACK against
the wall and off the fire escape.

CAROL RUNS ALMOST STAGGERING AND GETS READY TO JUMP the six
feet.

THE FIRE ESCAPE. BEGINS TO SINK. CAROL LOOKS AT DOC mutely,
as she sinks beneath the retaining wall.

                    DOC
              (his hand out)
          Jump!

And she does. He catches her and pulls her up.

They look at one another for a long moment, then he stands
and helps her to her feet, and leaving the shotgun behind
they walk into the alley.

RUDY LIES DEAD BEHIND THEM

IN A PARKING LOT AT THE END OF THE ALLEY, SLIM, a tough,
grizzly Western is about to pull out. Doc opens the back door
and Carol gets in. Doc opens the front door as Slim turns and
looks at him.

He lets out a yell and guns across the lot over the four foot
drop to the sidewalk and into and off a car and into the
street.

                    SLIM (CONT'D)
              (grinning)
          How was that?

          Just fine.

          Why not?

The car pulls forward as the light blinks to green.

EXT. STREET

AS THE CAR PASSES AN INTERSECTION, SEVERAL POLICE cars can be
seen arriving at the front of Laughlins.

The car continues moving up the street, then makes a right
onto a larger boulevard.

Doc half turns to Carol.

          You okay?

                    CAROL

          I kinda doubt it.

Slim is obviously pleased that some excitement has come into
his life.

          That's good... I'll cooperate, don't
          worry about that... yes sir, I've had
          some trouble with the law myself.

Doc and Carol look at the man.

          Three years ago I dynamited some fish at
          the reservoir.

          Oh my God.

THE AMERICAN OFFICIALS SIMPLY WAVE THE CAR BY.

At the white line a Mexican CUSTOMS OFFICER emerges from the

Carol snaps on the radioj the voice of a Mexican announcer is
heard.

THEY ARE WALKING ALONG THE HIGHWAY, THE EDSEL IS now a dot in

closer it is a bus. Very Mexican but very Greyhound in
appearance.

Doc and Carol turn, Doc flags it down.

It pulls to a stop, they board. The bus pulls out.

the Ghost and the Darkness - by William Goldman

 



"THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS"

by

William Goldman



FADE IN ON

A TINY FIGURE OF A MAN hurrying toward camera. The figure gets 
larger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or 
where we are.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		This is the most famous true story
		of Africa. It happened a hundred
		years ago, but even now, when
		children ask about it, you do not
		tell them at night.
			(The FIGURE continues 
			to grow)
		It began with the race to build a
		railroad across Africa.
			(beat)
		But this is not about building a
		railroad- it is about Patterson.

And now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, 
serious about his life, serious about his career. He has been 
successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his 
talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody.

AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND.

More specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant 
building - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, 
everything is clean and in order.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		Patterson was thirty. A brilliant
		engineer. A fine man, but do not
		become attached to him- there are
		many fine men in this story but do
		not become attached to any of them.
			(beat)
		So many of them die.

Patterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		And remember this: only the
		impossible parts of what follows
		really happened...
			(Now the door opens
			and we-)

CUT TO

Just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is 
ROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his 
office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are 
maps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside.

				BEAUMONT
			(The great smile flashes)
		John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm
		Robert Beaumont.
			(They shake hands)
		Firm- I like that, tells me a lot
		about you-
			(beat)
		-now why don't you tell me about me?
		To get you started, many people find
		me handsome, with a wonderful smile.
		I'm sure you agree.
			(Surprised, uncomfortable,
			Patterson nods)
		Winning personality, heaps of charm?

				PATTERSON
		My wife is the game player in the
		family, sir.

				BEAUMONT
		Games?
			(staring dead at Patterson)
		Look at me closely, Patterson: I am
		a monster. My only pleasure is
		tormenting people who work for me,
		such as yourself.
			(again the smile - only
			now it's chilling)
		One mistake and I promise you this:
		I'll make you hate me.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he realizes Beaumont is serious. Beaumont turns 
sharply and moves to a large map.

CUT TO

THE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear 
line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles.

				BEAUMONT
			(pointing along the line)
		We are building this railroad
		across Africa for the glorious
		purpose of saving Africa from the
		Africans. And, of course, to end
		slavery. The Germans and French
		are our competition. We are ahead,
		and we will stay ahead providing
		you do what I hired you to do-

CUT TO

A MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at "Tsavo," 130 miles in.

				BEAUMONT
		-build the bridge over the Tsavo
		river. And be finished in four
		months time. Can you do that?

				PATTERSON
		I'm sure you've examined my record.
		So you know I've never yet been
		late on a bridge.

				BEAUMONT
		You've never built in Africa.

				PATTERSON
		But I have in India- every country
		presents problems.

				BEAUMONT
		You'll need your confidence, I
		promise you.

				PATTERSON
		I've got a reason far beyond
		confidence: my wife is having our
		firstborn in five months and I
		promised I'd be with her when the
		baby comes.

				BEAUMONT
		Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched
		you confided in me.
			(beat)
		But I don't really give a shit about
		your upcoming litter. I've made you
		with this assignment-
			(the smile)
		-don't make me break you.

				PATTERSON
			(smiling right back)
		You won't have the chance.
			(glancing at his watch)
		Any further words of encouragement?
			(silence)
		Then I've a train to catch.

They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear 
they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we

CUT TO

A RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER

A train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. 
Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around.

CUT TO

HELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the 
kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not 
begun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into 
his arms.

				HELENA
		I tried to be late, John- it would
		have been easier if you'd gone.

				PATTERSON
			(They are nutty about
			each other - he nods)
		We're not much good at goodbyes, 
		Helena.

				HELENA
			(brightly)
		Tell me about Beaumont- does he
		understand how brilliant you are,
		how lucky he is to have you?

				PATTERSON
		It was embarrassing- the man showered
		me with compliments.

They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a 
quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-

				HELENA
		Oh dear-
			(beat)
		-you're geting that downtrodden look
		again-

				PATTERSON
		-well, it's just...
			(beat)
		...other men don't abandon their wives
		at such a time-

				HELENA
			(not unkindly)
		-oh please- if I'd been against your
		taking this, you would have abandoned
		me. You've been desperate to see Africa
		your whole life.

				PATTERSON
		What if there are complications?-

				HELENA
		-not "what if"- there will be, there
		always are. Which only means that our
		"son" and I- note my confidence- will
		have an excuse to come visit.

THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.

				HELENA
		Go, now.
			(He kisses her hand)
		Such a gentleman.
			(Now he holds her)

				PATTERSON
		I am desperate to see Africa- but I
		hate the leaving.

CUT TO

HELENA. She hates it, too.

				HELENA
		You build bridges, John-
			(beat)
		-you've got to go where the rivers are.

They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into 
each other's arms a final time, then-

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam-

-Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears.

HOLD FOR A MOMENT.

KEEP HOLDING.

Patterson runs out of the steam and we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A DIFFERENT TRAIN, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT WORLD.

This is the train to TSAVO and Patterson is alone on the engine 
seat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad 
inspectors and visiting VIPs. Behind it is a white circular piece 
of wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers.

CUT TO

NIGEL STARLING, running as best as he can alongside the train, 
trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat.

STARLING is a terribly appealing young man. Clothes do not fit him 
well, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that 
shirttail, trying to get things right. He wears glasses, tends 
nonetheless to squint at the world. He is, above all, a good man, 
morally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian 
times.

				STARLING
			(as Patterson helps
			him aboard)
		Many thanks.
			(squints)
		You're Patterson, yes?
			(Patterson nods)
		Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you
		at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must
		have told you that.

				PATTERSON
		He just gave me his "monster" speech.

				STARLING
		That. I know Robert seems dreadful, 
		but when you truly get to know the man,
		well, he's much worse.
			(beat)
		And I'm one of his defenders.
			(Patterson smiles)
		Forget him for now- it's your first
		ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it
		breathtaking.
			(And on that word-)

CUT TO

STARLING coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked 
with dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary 
desert.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting toward Starling)
		"Breathtaking" doesn't begin to do it
		justice.
			(As Starling starts to
			laugh, his mouth opens
			and sand flies in, and
			his coughing fit returns
			and)

CUT TO

THE DESERT. ENDLESS. LATER IN THE DAY.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust 
gets worse- a wind has kicked up.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, TRYING TO MAKE IT UP A STEEP GRADE. STILL LATER.

Patterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping 
to push it, trudging through the dust. All the other passengers 
spread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs 
all the assistance it can get.

CUT TO

INSIDE A RAILROAD CAR, EARLY EVENING.

Patterson and Starling, filthy, sit together. Starling has nodded 
off. Patterson has a book open in his lap-

-we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that 
accurate.

Now Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN POUNDING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

Stokers shovel coal. They are exhausted but they keep at it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. WAKING IN THE CAR, RUBBING HIS EYES. IT'S DAWN.

He stares out-

-and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And 
now, at last-

CUT TO

SOMETHING SPECIAL- and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first 
view of the Africa of his imagination.

Because the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees 
and one more thing-

-bursts of animals. On both sides of the train.

A flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing 
there amazing leap there.

Patterson is like a kid in a candy store.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, back outside in the engine seat again. 
Starling points-

				STARLING
		Aren't they amazing?

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S POINTING AT: Some giraffes running along, their absurd 
shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly 
long strides.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, staring out.

				PATTERSON
		You know the most amazing thing
		about them?- they only sleep five
		minutes a day.
			(Starling glances at him-
			clearly, he didn't know that)

CUT TO

A FAMILY OF HYENAS. Close by, loping in their scary way.

				STARLING
		Don't much like them.

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		The females are bigger- only animal
		here like that- have to be or they
		wouldn't survive because the males
		eat the young.

CUT TO

STARLING studying Patterson. Clearly, he didn't know that, either.

CUT TO

SOME HIPPOS moving along. Starling turns to Patterson.

				STARLING
		Anything special about them?

				PATTERSON
		Just that they fart through their
		mouths.
			(beat)
		Must make kissing something of a
		gamble.

				STARLING
			(laughs)
		I've lived in Africa a year and I
		don't know what you know. How long
		have you been here?

				PATTERSON
			(looks at his watch)
		Almost three hours.
			(beat)
		But I've been getting ready all my
		life.
			(Now, from them-)

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children 
who wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished 
looking than their mothers.

				STARLING
			(suddenly touched)
		Every time I see something like that,
		I know we're right to be here- to
		bring Christianity into their lives,
		enrich their souls.

				PATTERSON
		Beaumont says it's to end slavery.

				STARLING
			(shrugs)
		We all have our reasons. Mine is 
		simply to make them understand 
		happiness, accept salvation, know the 
		serenity that comes-
			(interrupts himself)
		-best I stop. One of the by-products 
		of my belief is that I can become 
		amazingly boring. But I know God smiles 
		on me.

				PATTERSON
			(They really like each other)
		Have you got that in writing?
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, laughs. And now-)

CUT TO

A WHITE CLAW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Hundreds of white claws.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

They aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and 
they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree.

And there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in 
with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked 
red rocks-

-now the train begins to slow.

Smoke drifts across.

A bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks.

				STARLING (over)
		Welcome to Tsavo.
			(on the word)

CUT TO

TSAVO.

We have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a 
place that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water 
tower is under construction-

-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for 
work.

THE TRAIN goes slower still.

No one stands idly around here.

But no one looks happy either.

ONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL.

An ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light 
the world.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train.

				STARLING
			(indicating Samuel,
			who is approaching)
		Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely
		indispensable- the only man here
		everyone trusts.

				PATTERSON
			(softly)
		Does he speak English?

				SAMUEL
			(not softly enough)
		And very poor French.

				STARLING
			(introducing)
		Samuel- John Patterson.

				SAMUEL
			(as they shake)
		The bridgebuilder-
			(gesturing to the 
			working men)
		-we have been getting ready for 
		you.

				PATTERSON
		Excellent. Could I see the bridge
		site?
			(Samuel nods)

				STARLING
		I've got medical supplies to
		deliver. Come along to the hospital
		when you're done.
			(starting off)

				SAMUEL
		I will bring him, Nigel.

We should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at 
the very beginning of the picture.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower.

Standing on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely 
powerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH.

WORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, 
some SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling.

				PATTERSON
		Why do the workers look unhappy?

				SAMUEL
		Because they are here.
			(beat)
		Because Tsavo is the worst place in
		the world.
			(He points ahead)
		Come, John- to the bridge.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along.

CUT TO

THE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it.

And here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot 
where the movie takes place was like.

There were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived 
in a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have 
come from the same town back in their country might choose to live 
in one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another 
cluster.

What we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are 
dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, 
these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)

The places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's 
living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where 
the bridge is to be built, etc., etc.

As they move, Samuel points out various camps.

A SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer.

ANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating.

A GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area.

Anyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a 
wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more.

Okay, back to the story.

				PATTERSON
			(as they pass the INDIAN
			tent area where prayer is
			starting)
		It's all wonderfully under control,
		Samuel- you've done a splendid job.

				SAMUEL
		Thank you. The truth is this: you
		have to work at it constantly.

				PATTERSON
		The workers don't get on?

				SAMUEL
		Get on? They detest each other.
		Obviously the Africans hate the
		Indians. But the Indians also hate
		the other Indians. Some of them
		worship cows, while others eat them.
			(As they move on)

CUT TO

RAILROAD TRACK.

PAN ALONG TO

MORE RAILROAD TRACK.

KEEP PANNING

And suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The 
track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where 
it just stops-

-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, 
is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of 
track.

				SAMUEL
			(to the far side)
		Railhead is across there.

CUT TO

THE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great 
clouds of dust.

				SAMUEL
		Three thousand men laying track- when
		the bridge is done, it all joins up.

Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at 
the space where the bridge is to be.

				SAMUEL
		Did it look like this in your mind?

				PATTERSON
			(shakes his head)
		This is more difficult-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited.

				PATTERSON
			(eyes bright)
		-but how wonderful that it's 
		difficult, it should be difficult- 
		what better job in all the world
		than build a bridge?- make things
		connect- bring worlds together- and
		get it right!
			(Now from Patterson-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT

as Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around-

-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured 
or with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, 
everything is working well, everything is under control. Starling 
approaches.

				STARLING
		Finish your tour?

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		And anxious to get started.
			(indicating the hospital)
		What is this, mostly malaria?

				STARLING
		Yes- but their suffering is only
		transitory- once they except God
		into their hearts, He will vanquish
		all pain.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the
		poor bastards will relapse if you keep
		on that way.
			(As they turn-)

CUT TO

DOCTOR DAVID HAWTHORNE. A tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy 
drinker. A man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years.

				HAWTHORNE
			(to Patterson)
		I'm David Hawthorne, this is my
		hospital. And my advice to you is,
		"don't get sick in front of it."
			(beat)
		That was meant to be charming, 
		sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.

				STARLING
		You never had it.

				HAWTHORNE
		Nigel and I don't like each other much.

				SAMUEL
			(breaking the tension)
		I am also liaison between these two.

				PATTERSON
			(to Hawthorne)
		Clearly you don't agree about building
		the railroad?

				HAWTHORNE
		This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it?
		It's only being built to control the
		ivory trade, make men richer.

				PATTERSON
		Then why do you stay?

				HAWTHORNE
		Who else would hire me?
			(to Starling)
		Beat you to it, didn't I?
			(beat)
		Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a
		little welcoming gift.
			(Now he gestures and we-)

CUT TO

A NERVOUS ORDERLY who approaches them. He has been freshly 
bandaged across one shoulder.

				HAWTHORNE
		This is Karim, one of my orderlies-
		attacked by a man-eater earlier
		today- first incident of that kind
		here.

Patterson says not a word, just studies the wounded man.

				STARLING
			(incredulous)
		A man-eater attacks and you're such
		a buffoon you almost forget to mention
		it?

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, he got away, didn't he?
			(to Patterson)
		Riding a donkey not far from here 
		when the lion sprang on them- donkey 
		took the brunt of it- then suddenly 
		the lion ran off.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Listening. No emotion on his face.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's kind of enjoying this. Bearing down.

				HAWTHORNE
		I know it's your first day and of
		course you must be tired from the
		journey-
			(beat)
		-but what are you going to do about
		it?

				PATTERSON
			(a long pause, then evenly-)
		Karim will have to show me where it
		happened. And of course, I'll need
		the donkey.
			(beat)
		With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
			(And he walks out, leaving
			an astonished Starling
			staring after him)

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And 
there are half a dozen ORDERLIES.

Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. 
Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches.

				STARLING
		I couldn't believe it when you said
		"sort it out." As if it were the most
		normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum,
		what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a
		killer beast this evening, nothing
		much else going on anyway."

				PATTERSON
		Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he?
		But that's all right- after all, I'm
		responsible for everything that happens
		here. And it certainly won't do much
		for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.

He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. 
There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY 
COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with 
precision. He arranges his books precisely too.

Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order.

				STARLING
			(calling out)
		You said "of course" you'd need the
		donkey. Why "of course"?

				PATTERSON
			(taking a rifle,
			moving outside)
		We know three things about man-eaters.
		First, they always return to where
		they've attacked before. Second, they're
		always old- they can't catch other 
		animals so they turn to us. And third,
		they're always alone- they've been cast
		out by their pride because they can't
		keep up.

CUT TO

STARLING, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited. 
But also a bit reluctant.

				STARLING
		I don't suppose I could watch.

				PATTERSON
			(delighted)
		Might be exciting for you.

				STARLING
		I've never been all that adventurous.
		I wouldn't be in the way?

				PATTERSON
		I'd love the company. And I've hunted
		all my life.

				STARLING
			(gathering courage)
		Well, why not? You seem so calm and
		experienced.
			(standing, teacup in hand)
		Why not, indeed!
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A SLIGHTLY WOUNDED DONKEY

It's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck. When it 
moves, they make a sound. Middle of the night. A night wind.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

We're in a clearing with thick trees all around.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND STARLING, seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge 
of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air. Patterson has his 
rifle ready. This next is all whispered.

				STARLING
			(embarrassed)
		I hate to be a bother, John, but the
		cramp's getting worse.
			(Pulls up his trousers-
			his leg is knotted)
		The pain is actually quite unbearable
		now.

				PATTERSON
		Shhh.

				STARLING
		I'm sure you mean that to be comforting,
		but-

				PATTERSON
			(interrupting)
		-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.

				STARLING
		That is precisely my plan- but back in
		my tent.
			(And he begins to climb down)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, grabbing him.

				PATTERSON
		They own the night- nobody moves when
		there's a man-eater out there.

Starling glumly obeys. Then-

				STARLING
		John? I know this isn't the time to ask,
		but-

				PATTERSON
		What?

				STARLING
		Since you'd only been here three hours
		when we met, are you sure this is how
		you hunt lions?

				PATTERSON
		Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse
		than you think- I've never even seen one.

CUT TO

STARLING, not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries 
to get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at 
the night.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

The donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as 
moved.

Now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little.

And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared-

-and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears 
from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound 
EXPLODES-

-and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked 
but unhurt-

-he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it.

				STARLING
			(amazed)
		...one shot...

				PATTERSON
			(even more amazed)
		So that's what a lion looks like.
			(Now from the tree-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT AREA - JUST AFTER DAWN

HOLD for a moment.

				SAMUEL (over)
		One shot- one-

KEEP HOLDING

Now Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited-

-it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile.

				SAMUEL
		Patterson has made the nights safe
		again.

KEEP HOLDING FOR JUST A MOMENT MORE.

As he walks on, behind him come THREE COOLIES carrying the body of 
the lion. As dozens of men come running in from all over to see 
the dead man-eater-

				SAMUEL
			(mimes shooting)
		BOOM!
			(Now as the crowd
			continues to grow-)

CUT TO

A ROUGH ENGINEER'S DRAWING OF WHAT WILL BE THE BRIDGE

It has two embankments on either side of the river.

These embankments are big- forty feet wide, fifty feet high.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING standing on the high ground where the 
embankment will start. From here, there is a slope down to the 
river itself.

Also present is UNGAN SIGNH, who we saw earlier standing 
precariously atop the water tower. Singh, enormously powerful, is 
another assistant. Bright, a great worker, another main character 
in what is to follow.

Now Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river- 
it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother 
him. He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who 
move down with him.

Singh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat. Starling does 
not, slipping and sliding.

				PATTERSON
			(gesturing)
		All right, I'd like to start the
		embankments today-
			(to Singh)
		-sufficient supplies on hand?

				SINGH
			(nods)
		More than.

				STARLING
		With much more on the way-
			(loses balance, falls)
		-John- we could have had this chat on
		flatter ground-

				PATTERSON
		-true enough- but without the comedy
		relief.
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, smiles, gets
			back up)

CUT TO

THE RIVER as they scramble down to it.

CUT TO

THE SLOPE they've come down- it's a long way back to the top.

CUT TO

THE THREE MEN. It's a glorious morning.

				PATTERSON
		How lucky we are.

				STARLING
		Aren't we full of ourselves today?
			(beat)
		I think it's because of the lion.

				PATTERSON
		Possibly.

				SINGH
			(soft)
		You know, I too have killed a lion.

				STARLING
		How many shots did you need?

CUT TO

SINGH. Almost embarrassed.

				SINGH
		I used my hands.

He holds his big hands up, palms out. Starling looks at Singh to 
see if he means it-

-he means it all right. Now, from Starling's perpetually surprised 
face-

CUT TO

SURVEYING EQUIPMENT

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON sighting through it- we are on the far side of the river 
now. Singh is there, Starling, too.

Behind them: a field of tall grass.

				PATTERSON
		All right- thee second embankment
		will go there.
			(He gestures toward
			the river)

				STARLING
		You do plan to mark it a bit more
		precisely than just-
			(imitating Patterson)
		-"there."

				PATTERSON
			(smiling)
		In your honor, Nigel. And you and
		Singh will be in charge of building
		them- and you'll also build the
		roadbeds and the three foundation
		pillars- and you'll be finished in
		eight thrilling weeks.

				STARLING
			(very dubious)
		John, it will not be easy.

				PATTERSON
		Nigel, you'll just have to use your
		hands-
			(And he smiles, repeating
			Singh's gesture, both 
			palms out)

CUT TO

SINGH. He smiles back, starts to reply. But his words stop, his 
smile dies. He just stares and we-

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S STARING AT- the surrounding field of tall grass. Nothing 
unusual about it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stares, too.

CUT TO

THE FIELD OF TALL GRASS- suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a 
fresh wind.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Silent. As before. Starling follows his glance.

CUT TO

SINGH. Frozen.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. And now the field is making odd patterns- as if 
something unseen were moving through.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. Nothing visible. But the odd pattern seems to be making 
its way across the field.

CUT TO

SINGH AND STARLING. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. The odd pattern seems to stop. Around it, the wind 
makes different shapes of the grass.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at 
the spot where the pattern stopped.

CUT TO

SINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to 
shiver, as if from cold.

CUT TO

THE BUILDING SEQUENCE

And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity.

Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and 
driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments.

And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as 
the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in 
the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there.

And alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with 
glasses and very bright eyes.

Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that 
is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to 
help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the 
clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with 
it, does well.

And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but 
mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the 
placements of the three stone foundation pillars-

-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- 
and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the 
start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor-

-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes-

-which is all he wears from now on.

And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, 
working with the power of three-

-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and 
Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded-

-it's hard, brutal work-

-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge 
skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work 
on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three 
foundation pillars are taking shape-

CUT TO

TONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to 
complete the embankments. As this goes on-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is 
going very quickly.

Patterson stops working, looks across the river-

-movement in the grassy area on the far side.

CUT TO

SEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to 
Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little 
men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL watching them.

				PATTERSON
		What are they looking at?

				SAMUEL
		You- they cannot believe you're
		still here.

				PATTERSON
		Nonsense.

				SAMUEL
		You don't know what Tsavo means, do
		you?
			(Patterson doesn't)
		It means "slaughter"...

CUT TO

THE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads.

CUT TO

THE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and 
pushed into shape.

CUT TO

THE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished.

CUT TO

THE ROADBED. The same.

CUT TO

THE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and

CUT TO

THE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last-

CUT TO

-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the 
river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other.

And they all look at each other- the embankments are both 
finished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying-

-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, 
in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password.

HOLD. A big moment for them all!

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT AREA

He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate 
is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat.

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too.

CUT TO

SINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep.

CUT TO

STARLING is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep 
already.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in his tent, closing his eyes.

CUT TO

SINGH, deep asleep in his tent-

-he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep. 
They lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the 
center pole, feet toward the edges of the tent.

HOLD ON SINGH. It's very dark. HE AND HIS MEN just lie motionless, 
breathing deeply.

KEEP HOLDING.

Now the CAMERA moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking 
down at the circle of men.

KEEP HOLDING.

They don't move, not even an inch. The steady breathing is the 
only sound.

YES, KEEP HOLDING.

KEEP HOLDING.

Nothing is going on down there. Nothing at all.

KEEP HOLDING.

Not a goddamn thing.

KEEP ON HOLDING. KEEP ON HOLDING.

And now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide-

-and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by 
some giant invisible wire-

CUT TO

SINGH. CLOSE UP. Screaming.

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT, waking, staring around and

CUT TO

SINGH as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams 
grow even louder as we

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT and it's like a bomb just went off, they 
rise, spin, cry out, stare-

CUT TO

THE NIGHT OUTSIDE AND SINGH'S BODY sliding along the ground. It's 
pitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's 
going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's 
making this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so 
dark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is 
in our way and

CUT TO

UP AHEAD, some bushes and

CUT TO

SINGH, his body going faster than before and his cries are 
weakening-

-CUT TO

THE NIGHT and his body and there is no sound at all coming from 
him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making 
this happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man 
as it skims along and-

CUT TO

UP AHEAD NOW, a low clump of bushes.

CUT TO

SINGH'S BODY, coming closer and

CUT TO

THE BUSHES and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn 
bushes and now-

CUT TO

SINGH, suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying 
over the bushes and gone!

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, early morning, their rifles held in front 
of them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and

CUT TO

THE GROUND. At first we can't make out much. Then we can- a spot 
of red.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, hurrying on again.

CUT TO

THORN TREES, and as they force their way through them-

CUT TO

A LARGE VULTURE, wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth-

-HOLD-

-as it lands we can see A DOZEN OTHER VULTURES are already there, 
surrounding something-

-but we can't make it out. We are in an area of grass and shadow-

-and specks of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, cries out in shock and fury, fires his rifle, races 
forward.

CUT TO

THE VULTURES screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch 
them soar into the morning sky-

				HAWTHORNE'S VOICE (over)
		What the lion must have done, once 
		he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin 
		off so he could drink his blood-

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

Hawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, 
but he's clearly upset- it's awful.

				HAWTHORNE
		-then he feasted on him, starting
		with his feet-

				STARLING
			(evenb more upset)
		-please- you needn't be so graphic-

				HAWTHORNE
		You intend "sorting this out" tonight?

				PATTERSON
		I'll try- but this feels so different-
		that old lion I killed could never
		carry off a man Singh's size.

				STARLING
			(maybe a little alarmed)
		But you said they were always old.

				PATTERSON
		That's what the books say...
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE DARKENING SKY. NOW-

CUT TO

ABDULLAH in tears. Where are we?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

This is Singh's funeral pyre.

Singh's body is being burned.

A LOT OF INDIANS are there. We've caught sight of some of them 
before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him 
in his tent.

There is a terrible sense of shock.

Patterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by 
the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final 
time.

CUT TO

THE FLAMES; they continue to rise...

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT

Night. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut 
and tied.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up 
in a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for 
anything. He cannot get comfortable.

CUT TO

THE AREA- nothing, no movement.

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT. As before.

CUT TO

THE AREA. No sign of movement of any kind. Dead.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but 
there is still darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his 
eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do-

CUT TO

TWO HUGE YELLOW EYES. That's all we see, just the eyes and they 
are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down 
and-

CUT TO

THE HUGE YELLOW EYES- only they're gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky.

CUT TO

THE SUN, RISING, THE NIGHT DONE.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back 
toward his tent area. Now he stops.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and a large group of workers- only they're not working. 
They smoke, play cards, sit around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, steaming, going up to Abdullah.

				PATTERSON
		You were contracted to work-

				ABDULLAH
			(gesturing around)
		-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

				PATTERSON
		Let me see the sick.

				ABDULLAH
			(not backing off)
		Oh, you're a doctor now, too?

				PATTERSON
		There is no reason for fear.

				ABDULLAH
		On that I choose to remain dubious.
			(beat)
		Two are dead now in two nights.
			(And on that news-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Rocked. He didn't know. Behind him now, Starling 
hurries up, Samuel alongside.

				PATTERSON
			(to Starling)
		Second death? Where?-

				STARLING
			(gesturing)
		-far end of camp- man wandering alone
		at night. Hawthorne's examining the
		body now.
			(beat)
		There's even less of him than of Singh.

				PATTERSON
			(just shakes his head)
		But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be
		that hungry this soon.
			(getting control- he
			looks to Samuel)
		Samuel?

				SAMUEL
		We should construct thorn fences 
		around every tent area. Fires burning 
		at night.

				PATTERSON
		Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew-
		no one allowed out at night.
			(to Abdullah)
		Send half your men to the bridge, the
		rest with these two.
			(Abdullah nods)
		And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But 
		I repeat- there is no reason for fear. 
		I will kill the lion and I will build 
		the bridge.

				ABDULLAH
		Of course you will, you are white, you
		can do anything...
			(They look at each 
			other. They are not 
			friends. Now-)

CUT TO

THE THORN BUSHES WE SAW ON OUR ARRIVAL TO TSAVO

ENDLESS NUMBERS OF THEM. There is a machete-like sound as we

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF WORKMEN, led by Samuel, chopping down branches. They do 
it with care- these are claws-

CUT TO

-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, 
he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his 
machete, moving in between bushes and

CUT TO

ONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling 
taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing-

-his arms are starting to bleed-

-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at 
them, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and 
right now, he is possessed.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward 
the bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY AREA

For a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we 
saw with Singh. Something is making the grass move-

-only now there is no wind... HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know.

CUT TO

STARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His 
clothes are shredded. A WORKER has finished with a section and 
satisfied, moves on-

-but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his 
bare hands and squeezes them together.

				STARLING
		Not good enough- look, it's got to
		be tighter. Tighter.

CUT TO

THE AREA IN WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING. FENCES ARE WELL ALONG TOWARD 
COMPLETION. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON.

PULL UP

We see more fences around more camp areas.

KEEP PULLING UP

The entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual 
areas protected.

The skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast.

Fires start up. Dozens of them.

Still darker.

Now workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety 
before darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, 
dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, 
get up, run on-

CUT TO

THE SUN. Falling out of the sky.

CUT TO

THE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD.

CUT TO

STARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. 
Samuel is with him. Both are exhausted.

Patterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. 
They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You 
get the sense these three will be friends forever.

				STARLING
		What a good week.

				PATTERSON
		You mean nobody died?

				STARLING
			(shakes his head)
		We all worked together. Worthy deeds
		were accomplished. I liked the labor.
			(beat)
		My mother insisted on piano lessons-
		broke the dear woman's heart when I
		turned out to be tone deaf- but she
		still was always at me about being
		careful with my hands.
			(looks at them)
		I like the blood, is that strange?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes, I think so.
			(Starling smiles, starts
			to speak)

				PATTERSON
		Look out, Samuel, here it comes.

				STARLING
		Even you two must admit that it is a
		glorious thing, what Man can
		accomplish. When there is a common
		splendid goal, there are no limits.
		Think what we will accomplish when we
		all have God's warmth in our hearts.
			(Samuel's eyes have 
			closed; he begins to snore. 
			Patterson can't help
			laughing)

CUT TO

STARLING. As good natured as ever.

				STARLING
		I am immune to your disdain.
			(He looks at them now)
		When I came here, I had but one small
		goal: to convert the entire continent
		of Africa.
			(shakes his head)
		Now I've decided to move on to
		something really difficult: I will not
		rest until both of you are safely in
		the fold.

				SAMUEL
		I've had four wives, good luck.

				STARLING
		The struggle is the glory...
			(HOLD ON the three friends)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the next morning, working with Abdullah and some others 
at the bridge.

CUT TO

STARLING completing work on the fence from the day before. It's 
high and taut and he's done a terrific job.

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION

A BUNCH OF OTHER MEN are working near a large grassy field. One of 
the men starts a chant. The others pick it up. It's really pretty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the 
chant comes distantly to him on the wind.

CUT TO

THE WORKMEN CHANTING LOUDER. It's turning into a stunner of a day- 
glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds.

CUT TO

STARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD. As before-

-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something 
flicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone 
too quickly.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON.

CUT TO

PATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the 
men, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD-

-and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking 
back in another 180 degree arc-

-still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a 
tail. Now quickly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view. He 
holds an envelope.

				SAMUEL
		For you.

				PATTERSON
			(taking it)
		Thank you, Samuel.

				SAMUEL
			(watching as Patterson
			opens it)
		Good news?

				PATTERSON
			(glancing at the letter)
		I expect so- it's from my wife.

				SAMUEL
		Do you love her?

				PATTERSON
		I do, actually; very much.

				SAMUEL
			(his wonderful smile)
		You give me hope, John.
			(As he walks away-)

CUT TO

STARLING, probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last 
weaknesses.

Behind him now, in the tall grass, something moves.

Starling, intent on his work, notices nothing.

CUT TO

THE SINGING MEN, getting more and more into it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, by the river, reading the letter.

There is a large tree up the riverbank. It casts a large shadow.

In the shadow now, something moves.

Patterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing.

				HELENA (over)
		Darling one- the big excitement
		yesterday was when some school-
		children spotted a whale-
			(pause)
		-they were looking at me, John-

CUT TO

HELENA, in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring 
out. She now has a considerable stomach.

				HELENA
		That was an attempt at humor but I
		don't feel very funny these days. I
		miss you terribly and after our son-
		I still have total confidence- well,
		after he's born I think travel might
		be broadening. As he kicks me at
		night I'm quite sure he's telling me
		he definitely wants to come to Africa.
			(pause)
		Thought you might need reminding.

CUT TO

PATTERSON by the river. He smiles, folds the letter. Now-

CUT TO

THE SINGING WORKMEN at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they 
sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound 
even better-

-there must be twenty of them, working and singing-

-and screaming!

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning his head sharply and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE SCREAMING WORKMEN and they're running now, running and 
shrieking and that's all we see, the workmen-

-some of them run left-

-some run right-

-and now a few of them are starting to cry.

CUT TO

A FAT COOLIE running and running, glancing back, screaming louder, 
running on and on and

CUT TO

-a shadow in the grass- no telling what- but it's big and it's 
moving and

CUT TO

THE FAT COOLIE and this next goes so fast it could be a dream- or, 
more accurately, a nightmare-

SHOCK CUT TO

A GIGANTIC WHITE MANED LION as it leaps onto the Fat Coolie, 
brings him to earth, bites his neck in two, kills him, just-like-
that.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, as they race away from the river and

CUT TO

STARLING, running from the fenced area- he holds a rifle in his 
hands.

CUT TO

ANOTER PART OF THE CAMP AND A DIFFERENT BUNCH OF WORKMEN- they 
freeze as the screams reach them and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, on the way to his tent area and

CUT TO

DIFFERENT WORKMEN listening in fear and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing to his tent, grabbing his rifle and cartridges 
and

CUT TO

STARLING, running toward the screaming and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he charges ahead, loading his rifle on the fly and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying more ammunition, running behind Patterson, 
keeping up and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and nothing is visible now- the men are gone and 
from this angle, it looks deserted and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, catching Starling, leading him into the TSAVO STATION 
area, Samuel just behind them.

CUT TO

A RECTANGULAR SHED, ahead of them. They move to it, slow-

-then they stop-

-a sound is heard- from around the corner- the sound continues- 
Patterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the 
crunching of bones.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, checking his rifle.

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same. Samuel, holding the extra ammunition, 
moves close to Patterson. Now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the 
corner and as he does-

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his 
feet-

-then the lion stares toward the shed as we

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right 
with him. THE LION is a good distance away.

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, a low growl coming from him as he takes the 
coolie's body by the shoulder, begins backing away with it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, dropping to his knees for the shot and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, growling louder and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, taking aim and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow 
motion-

-Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and-

-and this thing is suddenly there-

-this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the 
flat roof of the shed and

CUT TO

THE SUN, blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully 
stretched, it seems to go on forever and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning around to see and

CUT TO

STARLING, turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion 
now as we

CUT TO

This enormous BLACK-MANED LION diving into the three, sending them 
all sprawling and

CUT TO

THE WHITE MANED LION roaring and

CUT TO

THE BLACK MANED LION roaring, running to the other and

CUT TO

THE TWO LIONS IN CLOSE UP.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, for that is how they will be referred 
to-

-and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth-

-The Darkness has eyes that are crazed-

-they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old 
and the young and the fat and the strong-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to 
reach for his rifle and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, the white and the black, as they move 
toward the field of tall grass, roaring and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S RIFLE and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring 
sounds are deafening now and

CUT TO

THE TWO GIGANTIC MALES, backing into the tall grass-

-they roar one final time-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we

CUT TO

THE TALL GRASS and they're gone, the grass is full of moving 
patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing 
this way, that way-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field.

				PATTERSON
			(dazed)
		Jesus, two of them...

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and

CUT TO

STARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the 
young man, then-

CUT TO

THE STATION AREA

A train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly 
chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of 
the busier parts in camp-

-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with 
several dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting 
for the train.

Patterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah 
and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them 
walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting over the noise
			of the approaching train)
		-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-
			(gesturing toward the men
			who stand by the train
			tracks)
		-there's nothing wrong with your men
		so stop telling me there is-

				ABDULLAH
			(advancing on Patterson now)
		-you do not call me a liar- you know
		nothing of their health- consider
		yourself fortunate I persuaded so 
		many to stay- consider yourself 
		fortunate I have decided to stay-

				PATTERSON
			(losing it)
		You think you matter?
			(gesturing toward the
			train which is close to
			stopping now)
		-Beaumont is on that train- he 
		matters-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving in on Abdullah now-

				PATTERSON
		He sees this chaos, he'll replace 
		you all.

				ABDULLAH
		He'll replace you, too- that's all 
		you really care about.

				PATTERSON
		You think so? Fine.
			(finished arguing)
		It's best you get out. Go. Tell all 
		your people to go, run home where 
		they'll be safe under the covers and 
		when the bridge is built and the
		railroad is done, they can tell their
		women that out of all the thousands
		who worked here, they were the only
		ones to flee-
			(And he wheels around,
			starts to walk away as we-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. Quiet, staring after Patterson.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Patterson has won. As the two of them exchange a quick 
glance-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT standing in the door of a passenger car, handsome as 
ever. Somehow his clothes are still pressed.

Patterson moves up. In a splendid mood. Samuel is happy too.

				PATTERSON
		Pleasant journey?

				BEAUMONT
			(stepping off the train)
		How could it be? I hate Africa.

Now there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks 
around and we

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and his workmen, moving away from the train- they are 
singing the same song that the workmen sang just before The Ghost 
and The Darkness attacked- it's pretty- but it's also a little 
unnerving.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Listening a moment.

				BEAUMONT
		Lovely sound- they seem happy.

				PATTERSON
		Don't they, though?

				BEAUMONT
		So work must be going well?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He and Samuel share another glance.

				PATTERSON
			(delicately)
		Truthfully?
			(beat)
		There has been the occasional odd
		hiccup- but then, as you so wisely
		told me, I'd never built in Africa.

				BEAUMONT
		But overall, you're pleased?

				SAMUEL
			(moving in)
		I have never experienced anything
		like it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT; almost longingly looks back at the train.

				BEAUMONT
		I almost feel like getting right
		back on.
			(glances at his watch)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. They do not breathe.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He really wants to leave and for a moment it looks like 
he just might.

				BEAUMONT
			(a sigh)
		I suppose it would be a dereliction
		of duty not to at least look around.

Now Abdullah wanders happily by.

				PATTERSON
			(waving)
		Morning, friend, glorious day.

				ABDULLAH
		As are they all.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He takes a step inside the passenger car.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. Hoping.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Reluctantly returning. He has a large box.

				BEAUMONT
		I do need to see Starling.

				PATTERSON
			(dully)
		Starling?

				BEAUMONT
		Awhile back he ordered some bibles-
			(indicating the box)
		-I've brought them.
			(looking around)
		Is he here?

				PATTERSON
			(beat)
		Yes he is.

				BEAUMONT
		Well, I need to speak to him.

				SAMUEL
			(helpfully)
		Let me deliver the bibles.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. His eyes flick from one man to the other. It's over.

				BEAUMONT
		Excellent show.
			(voice low)
		Where is Starling?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The jig is up. He gestures-

				PATTERSON
		Here he comes now.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

HALF A DOZEN NATIVES CARRYING STARLING'S COFFIN. They start to put 
it on the train and as they do-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Stunned. And furious! He storms off the train and we-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE

as Beaumont sees it. Patterson and Samuel are with him.

Little more work has been done than the last time we saw it. A few 
men are working slowly.

And now there are guards with rifles patrolling it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. A deadly look at them. He storms off.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand 
quietly.

It's much more crowded than the last time. Still under control, 
but barely.

Beaumont is icy now. He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join 
them.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL

THE FOUR MEN speak low and fast-

				BEAUMONT
		What in hell is going on?

				SAMUEL
		The Ghost and The Darkness have come.

				BEAUMONT
			(snapping)
		In English.

				PATTERSON
		It's what the natives are calling 
		the lions-
			(beat)
		-two lions have been causing trouble-

				BEAUMONT
		-what's the surprise in that, this is
		Africa?

				PATTERSON
		It hasn't been that simple so far.

				BEAUMONT
		What have they done besides kill
		Starling?
			(beat)
		How many have they killed?
			(Patterson nods for
			Hawthorne to answer)

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Doing his best.

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, of course, I can't supply a
		totally accurate answer because
		there are those that are actually
		authenticated and there are those
		that we once thought were workers
		killing each other or deserting
		from camp so any number I give is
		subject to error-

				BEAUMONT
			(cutting through)
		How many?

				HAWTHORNE
		Thirty, I should think.

				BEAUMONT
			(stunned)
		Christ!
			(whirling on Patterson)
		What are you doing about it?
			(Now from there-)

CUT TO

SOMETHING VERY ODD:

We are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area. This is 
not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by 
thorn trees.

Several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to 
disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing 
but a small railroad car.

It is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND BEAUMONT looking at it.

				BEAUMONT
		This is supposed to be salvation?
			(staring at Patterson)
		What kind of idiocy are we dealing
		with here?

				PATTERSON
			(keeping control)
		I'm calling it my "contraption"-
		we're going to surround it with a
		boma- a fence, to you- and we're
		going to leave a small opening
		opposite that door.

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR. There is, in fact, an open front door. Patterson 
gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAR AS THEY ENTER. It has been divided in half by thick 
metal bars from floor to ceiling. The bars are close together, 
only a few inches between them.

				PATTERSON
		In that half will be bait- human
		bait- I'll start things off-
			(points to the open
			doorway)
		-a sliding door will fit above that
		and a trip wire will run across
		the floor.

				BEAUMONT
			(The smile is back)
		Genius- the beast will enter,
		tripping the wire, the door will
		slide down, trapping him, you, safe
		behind the bars, will have him at
		your mercy and will shoot him.

Patterson nods. Beaumont explodes.

				BEAUMONT
		Are you running a high fever, man?
		How could you expect something as
		lunatic as this to succeed? How
		could you even conceive of it?

				PATTERSON
		I didn't conceive of it for the
		lions- I built one in India when
		there was trouble with a tiger.

				BEAUMONT
			(incredulous)
		And it worked?

				PATTERSON
			(He hates to say this)
		In point of fact, it didn't.
			(hurrying on)
		But I'm convinced the theory is
		sound.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM. They move outside. The tension between them is 
considerable. Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment.

				PATTERSON
		What?

				BEAUMONT
		I made a mistake hiring you- 
		you're simply not up to the job.
			(Silence. Then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP.

				PATTERSON
		You genuinely enjoy trying to	
		terrify people, don't you? Well, 
		fine-
			(lashing back)
		-except there isn't a higher rated
		engineer and we both know that. And
		since time is so important to you,
		how long do you think it would take 
		to find someone else qualified and 
		bring him here?

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Blazing.

				BEAUMONT
		Let me explain about time- you've 
		been here three months and already 
		two months behind. And the Germans 
		and the French are gearing up. And 
		I don't care about you and I don't 
		care about the thirty dead- I care 
		about my knighthood and if this 
		railroad finishes on schedule, I'll 
		get my knighthood and I want it.
			(glancing around as
			Samuel appears, goes to
			the workers)
		Professional hunters may be the answer.

				PATTERSON
		All they'll bring is more chaos and
		we've plenty of that already- and if
		they come in, word will get out- and
		what happens to your knighthood then?

				BEAUMONT
		I'm going to try and locate Redbeard-
		I assume you've heard of him.

				PATTERSON
		Every man who's ever fired a rifle has 
		heard of him- by the time you find him,
		the lions will be dead.

				BEAUMONT
			(long pause)
		Very well, the job's still yours, I'll 
		go. But if I have to return, you're
		finished. And I will then do everything
		I can to destroy your reputation. Am I
		not fair?
			(The great smile flashes)
		Told you you'd hate me.
			(And he turns, walks off)

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Moving up to Patterson. Samuel has a bag.

				PATTERSON
			(staring after Beaumont)
		I do hate him.
			(takes the bag from
			Samuel, pulls out flares)
		I want you to distribute one bag of
		flares to every tent area-
			(takes out a flare)
		-tell the men to light them if
		there's trouble-
			(beat)
		-make it two bags.
			(HOLD briefly, then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. ALONE. THAT NIGHT. IN HIS CONTRAPTION.

A lamp burns alongside him. Across the bars, the door of the 
railroad car is open. Flickering shadows. Above the doorway is a 
thick wooden slab the size of the door. n the ground, barely 
visible, the trip wire.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. Outside, something is moving.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rifle ready, holding his breath.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. SIlence. Nothing moves now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He rubs his eyes with his hands...

CUT TO

FLICKERING SHADOWS on the wall. It's later that night.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The man is bleary with fatigue. He sits in a corner of 
the car, writing a letter.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		"Dearest...
		...peace and tranquility continue to
		abound here- the workers report each
		day with a smile- except for your
		absence, this whole adventunre is
		providing me nothing but pleasure..."

CUT TO

THE FLICKERING WALLS OF THE RAILWAY CAR. It's later still. 
Patterson, finished writing, stares out at the night.

CUT TO

A FLARE, rising brightly toward the sky.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, seeing the flare. The man is miserable.

CUT TO

A TREE BRANCH. MANY FLOWERS AS WELL AS THE CLAW THORNS.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		Fire.

The branch is destroyed, the flowers blown away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THREE INDIAN COOLIES. NOT FAR FROM HIS CONTRAPTION.

THE COOLIES hold rifles. They look like brothers, which they are. 
They also look tough. And they are that, too. THREE 
STREETFIGHTERS.

				PATTERSON
			(impressed)
		Very good indeed.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
			(he wears glasses)
		We have hunted since childhood.

				PATTERSON
		All right- you'll spend your nights
		inside.
			(He indicates the railroad
			car. The Coolies nod)
		You'll have plenty of ammunition.
		You're totally protected, you have
		really nothing to fear.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		That is correct.
			(beat)
		Nothing.

Patterson looks at the three men. Obviously, he could not have 
chosen better. From them-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. DAY.

A lot of men working under Patterson. Progress is slow.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. NIGHT.

Some men sit on the part that's been built. Spending the night 
there for protection. Now, they all turn and we

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE going off in another part of camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in a tree alone, in despair.

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES IN THE RAILROAD CAR.

Tough as ever. Ready for anything. But nothing is happening. 
Silence.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE AGAIN AS NIGHT FALLS - MORE CROWDED THAN BEFORE.

STILL MORE MEN are moving into the river. They wade til the water 
is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to 
sing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. 
Lovely.

CUT TO

MOONLIGHT ON THE WATER. The men stand as before, singing softly. 
The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe-

-or rather they should be.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling 
the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as 
the others start to scream-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching another flare rise, helplessly listening.

CUT TO

A CATTLE PEN. THE CATTLE ARE NERVOUS-

-one of them kicks wildly at the wind.

They should be nervous-

-The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on 
it, brings it to earth as the dust rises.

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE IN THE NIGHT.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL. DAY. PACKED.

HAWTHORNE seems overwhelmed.

CUT TO

SOMETHING.

And for a moment we don't know what it is. There is a faint light 
and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire.

HOLD ON THE WIRE.

And now a paw walks across it-

-and the instant that happens-

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, the brothers, in the contraption, two of them 
asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad 
car and

CUT TO

THE DOOR OF THE RAILROAD CAR slamming loudly down and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE DARKNESS, standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's 
incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked 
and

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

The entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves. 
In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough 
coolies.

For a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too 
startled and surprised to do anything but stare-

-and then all hell just explodes as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the 
kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but 
this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more 
terrifying and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, throwing his huge body at the bars and

CUT TO

THE BARS and both his front claws are slashing through and

CUT TO

THE THREE TOUGH COOLIES and they retreat against the rear wall of 
the car.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again 
and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do 
anything but stare and

CUT TO

THE CLAWS, ripping at the air and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping forward, smashing into the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING WHERE THE BARS are connected and the sheer power of 
his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, staring up at the ceiling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, AND HERE HE COMES AGAIN, roaring and his body hits 
the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING- and the bars shake-

-but they're not giving way.

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, as they begin to realize this and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, clawing for them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, raging and roaring on his side of the bars and

CUT TO

THE FIRST COOLIE, raising his gun and

CUT TO

THE SECOND COOLIE, his gun raised too and

CUT TO

THE THIRD COOLIE and he's ready and

CUT TO

ALL THREE AS THEY FIRE-

-and reload-

-and fire again, and reload, and-

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR- and suddenly the lamp is knocked over-

-and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like 
hell in there-

-only it gets worse as we-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS at the bars-

-and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering 
over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you-

CUT TO

THE COOLIES staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're 
more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but 
these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the 
deafening roars of the beast and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, 
trying to knock them down but they're holding and

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, reloading and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped 
and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes 
have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, firing again and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they 
shake, but they keep on holding and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, 
something's starting to come clear-

-amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, 
they're missing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared 
and

CUT TO

THE DOOR THAT SLID DOWN- it's held in place by some thick wooden 
bars-

-and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars 
because they begin to splinter and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling, leaping at the bars and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES firing and then-

CUT TO

THE DOOR as it flops open and just like that-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Out the door and gone. HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON JUST AFTER DAWN IN THE DAMAGED RAILROAD CAR.

Patterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are 
where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars.

This was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his 
notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend 
how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, 
it really happened.

				PATTERSON
		Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-I would never make excuses- but a
		fire broke out- the light was bad- he
		kept moving-

				PATTERSON
		-well, of course he kept moving- but
		he couldn't have been more than ten
		feet away from the three of you- surely
		you must have wounded the thing-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		I assure you we came close many times-

Abdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen 
men. And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a 
confrontation.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-the next time we will do better.
			(Patterson makes no
			reaction; moves outside)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's 
out.

				ABDULLAH
		The next time will be as this time-
		The Devil has come to Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
			(not in a mood for this)
		-that's ridiculous talk and you can't
		seriously believe it-

				ABDULLAH
			(moving in- tension rising
			as others crowd behind him)
		-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I
		don't think so-

CUT TO

THE BUSH just beyond- something is moving- an animal?- Impossible 
to say.

				PATTERSON
		I wasn't and you know it and don't
		push it- just listen- we have a
		problem in Tsavo-

				ABDULLAH
			(cutting in)
		-at last you're right- we do- you are
		the problem in Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
		-careful, Abdullah-

Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous.

				ABDULLAH
		You do not tell me "careful"- you do
		not tell me anything- you listen
		while I talk-
			(Now suddenly a shadow
			seems to cross-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. CLOSE UP. His eyes widen.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

AN ENORMOUS PISTOL. Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		-change in plan- you listen while
		I talk- because you have a question
		that needs answering.
			(beat)
		Will I pull the trigger?

PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL

REDBEARD.

We are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with 
a tanned face and a thick grey beard. He has seen everything and 
is capable of anything.

Just now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah. Very 
calmly, he cocks the pistol.

				SAMUEL (over)
		It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill
		you.

				REDBEARD
			(not looking around)
		No hints, Samuel.

				ABDULLAH
			(The name has registered)
		You don't know all that has happened
		here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.

				REDBEARD
		You're right. The Devil has come. Look
		at me. I am the Devil.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, staring at Redbeard. Right now Redbeard just could be.

				ABDULLAH
			(louder)
		I am a man of peace.

				REDBEARD
		Am I to take it you want to live?

				ABDULLAH
		Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

				REDBEARD
		Excellent decision.
			(Now he suddenly reaches
			out, shakes Abdullah's hand)
		Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll
		meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid
		morning.

				ABDULLAH
			(dazed- leaving)
		I think it's been a pleasure.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, and now he does another surprising thing: embraces 
Samuel.

				REDBEARD
			(three words)
		You got old.
			(Now he releases Samuel,
			turns to Patterson)
		I'm sure you're John Patterson.
			(before Patterson can reply)
		Stay out of my way.
			(And without another word,
			he's gone)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Redbeard moves through, taking it all in. It's even worse than 
when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the 
sound of pain and sickness.

Patterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting.

				PATTERSON
			(as Redbeard approaches)
		I didn't have a chance to thank you.

				REDBEARD
			(preoccupied)
		What did I do?

				PATTERSON
		Got me out of trouble.

				REDBEARD
			(matter of fact)
		Nonsense- Samuel would have done
		something.
			(starts to move on)

				PATTERSON
		We need to talk.

				REDBEARD
		Let me save time- (1) you are the
		engineer; (2) you are in charge;
		(3) you're sorry I'm here. Right
		so far?
			(Patterson nods)
		Good- because (1) I am not an
		engineer, (2) I don't want to be
		in charge, and (3) I'm sorrier than
		you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo.
		So I will help you by killing the
		lions and leaving, and you will help
		me by doing what I tell you so I
		can leave. See any problems?

				PATTERSON
		Actually, no.

				REDBEARD
		All right- let's go into battle.
			(suddenly taking
			Patterson's hand)
		I'm Redbeard.
			(as they shake)

				PATTERSON
		Somehow I guessed.
			(As they move outside-)

CUT TO

THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

A BUNCH OF MEN WAIT. Hwathorne, Samuel, Abdullah, and perhaps a 
dozen other worker leaders. Redbeard and Patterson move to them.

				REDBEARD
		Starting now, we attack them.

				ABDULLAH
		How; we don't know where they are?

				REDBEARD
		We'll have to make them come to us,
		won't we? And since there are two of
		them, we're going to set two plans
		in motion.
			(to Hawthorne)
		First: we must move the entire
		hospital by tomorrow night.

				HAWTHORNE
			(appalled)
		That's a terrible idea-

				REDBEARD
			(backtracking)
		-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of
		course, you're the doctor, you 
		should know.

				HAWTHORNE
		Silliest thing I ever heard of- why
		in the world should we go through
		all that?

				REDBEARD
			(charming now)
		I suppose I could answer you. I
		suppose I could explain that the 
		place is so inviting, what with the 
		smell of blood and flesh, that they 
		have to strike. It's even possible 
		that I tell you I found some fresh 
		paw marks around back which means 
		they're already contemplating 
		feasting here.
			(Turning on Hawthorne
			now- his voice building)
		But I don't want to answer you 
		because when you question me you are 
		really saying that I don't have the 
		least idea what I am doing, that I am 
		nothing but an incompetent, that I am 
		a fool.
			(big)
		Anyone who finds me a fool, please 
		say so now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(The words burst out)
		I have been desperate for Patterson 
		to let me move the hospital since the 
		day he arrived.

				REDBEARD
			(nice smile)
		Then we agree.
			(And on that-)

BEGIN THE BUILDING SEQUENCE.

It was a huge effort and they got half of it done that day- but 
there was always the sense of impending bloodshed.

What we see first are Patterson and a bunch of shots of a lot of 
workers- laying out the dimensions of the new boma that would 
surround the place. This was to be by far the biggest wall fence 
they had in Tsavo.

And now here comes Abdullah leading a crowd of men, wading into a 
huge patch of thorn trees, cutting the thick branches down, 
starting to load them for carrying-

-and it's high noon now, and Patterson drenched with sweat, leads 
the start of the actual building- taking the thorn branches, 
bunching them together, forcing them so there is no room between 
them-

-and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be- 
except at the moment it's barely a foot high-

-and now Redbeard appears, beckons to Patterson, and

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A FLAT GRASSY PLAIN. AFTERNOON NOW.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel walk quickly.

CUT TO

SAMUEL turning to Redbeard and Patterson.

				SAMUEL
		Soon.
			(Redbeard nods)

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		I have to ask- why do you need me?

				REDBEARD
		I don't really. But understand
		something- even though it may take
		me two or three days to sort this
		out-
			(Patterson has to smile
			at the phrase)
		-when I'm gone, you'll still have
		to build the bridge. And I don't
		want the men to have lost respect
		for you.

				PATTERSON
			(kind of surprised)
		That's very considerate.

				REDBEARD
		I'm always considerate- my mother
		taught me that.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, who just breaks out laughing.

				REDBEARD
		Why do you laugh?- you don't
		believe she taught me?

				SAMUEL
		I don't believe you had a mother.
			(And as Redbeard
			laughs too-)

CUT TO

A MASAI VILLAGE as they approach. Redbeard walks ahead.

				PATTERSON
		You like him, don't you?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes. But it takes time.

				PATTERSON
		You've known him long?

				SAMUEL
			(He has)
		Since his beard was red.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE VILLAGE. AN AGED CHIEF RUNS THINGS.

Redbeard, Patterson and Samuel stand near him. WOMEN and CHILDREN 
are there. Some of the children look at Redbeard, mime shooting, 
fall down dead. Samuel translates as necessary.

				SAMUEL
		How many cattle?

				REDBEARD
		Four should do it.

				SAMUEL
		They will want a lot of money.

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		Have you got it?

				REDBEARD
		No, but you do-
			(beat)
		-see, you were needed after all.
			(to Samuel)
		And fifty warriors at the camp
		before dawn.

				SAMUEL
			(Samuel explains. The
			Masai Chief replies.
			Translating)
		Why so many?

				REDBEARD
		Because I have two plans to kill
		the lions- one involving the cattle,
		the other the men.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON watching as Samuel tells the Chief.

CUT TO

THE MASAI CHIEF. He moves toward Redbeard and Patterson. As he 
speaks, Samuel translates quietly. There is a sadness in the 
Chief's tone.

				SAMUEL
			(translating)
		The Ghost and the Darkness have
		come... and we can do nothing...
		but if you anger them... they will
		stay in Tsavo... and life will
		become more unberable, that I know...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching as Redbeard replies.

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Two lions are all that have come...
		they're only lions, that I know.
			(beat)
		And I will kill them both tomorrow.
			(HOLD BRIEFLY, then-)

CUT TO

SHADOWS AND FIRELIGHT. IT'S NIGHT NOW.

We're not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic 
sounds.

Now we hear voices.

				REDBEARD VOICE (over)
		I'll need you by me in the morning.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Whatever you wish.

CUT TO

WHERE WE ARE- IT'S PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. Patterson, Redbeard, 
Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire.

THey are cleaning their guns, getting ready.

A WORD ABOUT THEIR WEAPONS. Patterson's is a good rifle and he 
cleans it expertly.

Redbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move 
as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child.

Hawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is 
clearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing 
power.

There is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel 
show it. Redbeard is as before.

				HAWTHORNE
			(terribly tense)
		You're certain about tomorrow?
			(Redbeard is)
		But you don't seem excited.
			(Redbeard isn't)

				PATTERSON
		You don't enjoy killing, do you?
			(Redbeard doesn't)

				HAWTHORNE
		Then why do it?

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. He stares at the fire. Then-

				REDBEARD
		I have a gift.

CUT TO

THE CAMPFIRE. Silence for a moment except for the sound of the 
weapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back 
together. He stands, nods, goes.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, watching him.

				HAWTHORNE
		Strange man.
			(to Samuel)
		Has he always been this way?

				SAMUEL
		Much gentler now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(shakes his head on that)
		John?-
			(He holds out his
			beautiful rifle)
		Change guns with me- mine's much
		more powerful. I'll be finishing
		the hospital tomorrow so I won't
		be with you- but if you'll use
		this...
			(beat)
		...then I will.

Patterson, touched, changes weapons.

				PATTERSON
		Thank you.
			(He turns to Samuel)
		Why does he need you by him?

				SAMUEL
		He doesn't. He needs nobody. But
		we have hunted many times...
			(beat)
		...he knows I am afraid of lions...

HOLD ON THE FIRELIGHT UNTIL WE SHARPLY-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. BEFORE DAWN.

Misty- hard to see much.

Then GHOSTS appear-

KEEP HOLDING

-they're not ghosts, they're MASAI WARRIORS emerging from the 
mists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking 
equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them 
materialize-

CUT TO

A HUGE THICKET.

Redbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach.

				REDBEARD
			(whispered)
		I spotted one of them-
			(gesturing toward
			the thicket)
		-in there.

CUT TO

THE THICKET again- alive with thorn trees. Dark, filled with long 
dark shadows.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. A lot of tension.

				REDBEARD
		The best way to ensure the kill
		when you're using trackers is for
		one to shoot while the other uses
		the trackers to force the lion
		toward the shooter. Have you ever
		led trackers?

				PATTERSON
			(He hasn't)
		I can try.

				REDBEARD
			(no good)
		Samuel says you killed a lion.

				PATTERSON
		It was probably luck- I'd rather
		you did the shooting.

				REDBEARD
		You'd never force the lion to me-
		and nobody ever got a lion with
		one shot by luck.
			(points- hand out
			straight)
		Around there's a clearing- you'll
		know it from the anthills- get
		there and hide and listen to the
		sounds- I'll make the lion come
		directly to you.
			(He gestures for
			Patterson to take
			off and as he does-)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS as Redbeard goes to them-

				REDBEARD
			(as Samuel translates)
		-all of you- spread the width of
		the clearing- no gaps- go-
			(claps his hands once)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spreading apart.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like hell.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently.

CUT TO

A THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ducking his head, blasting through.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, starting to cover the entire width of the thicket.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, quickstepping over rocky terrain.

CUT TO

SAMUEL staying close to Redbeard. The fear is there.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, studying the position of the Warriors, who are almost 
ready.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, circling now, racing toward a clearing, picking up 
speed.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spread out. They look to Redbeard.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Not yet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing into the clearing, glances around- lots of 
anthills.

CUT TO

AN ANTHILL, eight feet high. It casts a long shadow.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Holding Hawthorne's marvelous rifle, he slips silently 
into the shadow.

HOLD ON PATTERSON- it's almost as if he weren't there.

CUT SHARPLY TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Suddenly screaming and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, screaming too and

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, suddenly moving forward, all of them 
shouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the shadow. The noise is faint- but he can hear it.

CUT TO

A DOZEN DRUMMERS, moving forward, banging away.

CUT TO

A DOZEN MORE DRUMMERS, even louder.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving forward, his eyes flicking ahead-

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Just the least bit louder now.

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, screaming and pounding and

CUT TO

SAMUEL- the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. His eyes flicking ahead.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. It's a lot louder now. He's totally still. And he's 
ready.

CUT TO

THE DENSEST PART OF THE THICKET we've seen yet.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, slashing their way through, drumming and shouting 
and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, at their head, eyes, as always, flicking.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

REDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point-

-because something is there-

CUT BACK TO

THE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw 
it before-

-but now something begins to move and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and 
they're starting to move faster and

CUT TO

PATTERSON IN THE SHADOW.

The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more 
distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we

CUT TO

A FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to 
move away from the sound-

-and toward where Patterson is waiting.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and

CUT TO

SAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON- he fingers the weapon.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now 
instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors 
to get left and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The 
Ghost's intended path and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift 
the other way and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's 
path again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in 
the original direction- toward Patterson and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass 
hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and 
sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but 
you couldn't tell that from what they're doing-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware 
of Patterson's existence behind him.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the 
sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to turn.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ready to fire.

CUT TO

THE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And 
now its lips go back as it sees Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he 
squeezes the trigger-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull 
snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, unharmed and

CUT TO

PATTERSON desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function 
and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. It stares at Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST-

-and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau-

-THEN THE GHOST ROARS-

CUT TO

REDBEARD as he hears it, breaking into a wild run-

				REDBEARD
		Shoot for chrissakes!-

CUT TO

PATTERSON standing his ground as now THE GHOST takes a step toward 
him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the 
clearing and as he reaches it-

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and

CUT TO

REDBEARD's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot 
at the animal- he curses, races for a better position and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. One final stare at Patterson-

-then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket-

-and it's safe and free and gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Rocked.

The low point of his life.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, catching up to Redbeard.

				SAMUEL
		Did you ever see a lion that size?

				REDBEARD
		Not even close.
			(Now he moves to
			Patterson)
		What happened?

				PATTERSON
			(a whisper)
		...misfire... it jammed...

				REDBEARD
		Has it ever done that before?

				PATTERSON
		...don't know...

				SAMUEL
		It's Hawthorne's.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Trying for control.

				REDBEARD
		You exchanged weapons?
			(Patterson nods)
		You went into battle with an
		untried gun?
			(Patterson nods)

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's 
going to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to 
happen.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet.

CUT TO

REEDBEARD, studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, 
his voice is surprisingly quiet.

				REDBEARD
		They have an expression in
		prizefighting: "everyone has a plan
		until they're hit."
			(beat)
		You've just been hit...
			(beat)
		...the getting up is up to you...
			(And he turns, moves
			off and)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL.

Nearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is 
supervising men and material that are being transferred.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to 
the center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the 
outskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the 
sick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now.

Patterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are TWO 
EXPERIENCED ORDERLIES, both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson 
is silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his 
face.

				REDBEARD
			(to the Orderlies)
		Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell
		at all here, and little blood. When
		we leave, close the gate securely,
		don't open it til morning and keep
		your fires high. Any questions, ask
		them now.
			(They understand- now
			to Samuel and Hawthorne)
		You two will sleep beautifully in
		your tents.
			(beat)
		And stay there.

				SAMUEL
		And where will you sleep beautifully?

				REDBEARD
			(smile)
		Patterson and I will be in the old
		hospital- where the enticing smell
		of sickness still lingers-
			(beat)
		-and by the time we're done, I
		promise you, the odor of blood will
		be irresistible.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. STARTING TO GET DARK.

Redbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the 
inside perimeter-

-buckets of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Darker. They empty still more full buckets 
of blood. Redbeard seems pleased.

CUT TO

SAMUEL AND HAWTHORNE, hurrying toward their camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of 
the Old Hospital.

CUT TO

THE ORDERLIES IN THE NEW HOSPITAL, firmly closing and locking the 
gate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, just outside the fence of the Old 
Hospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as 
they move.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Dying... dying...

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They slip inside the deserted Old 
Hospital, pull the gate securely shut.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE. They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling 
to each other.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are 
already asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their 
fire, waiting. The cows are quiet.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they 
drink tea.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Walking the fence perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The cows are edgy. He calms the cows.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE OLD HOSPITAL. The large chunks of meat are visible in 
the moonlight.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The orderlies are calm.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, still walking the perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard 
moves to him, speaks in a whisper.

				REDBEARD
		Think about something else.

				PATTERSON
		Have you ever failed?

				REDBEARD
			(sad smile)
		Only in life...
			(He walks away.
			Patterson watches.)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly.

CUT TO

THE NIGHT AND THE MOON. Lovely.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly 
quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from 
Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the 
ripping of flesh-

CAMERA MOVES UP

Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in 
shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.

Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for 
Patterson to switch positions with him.

As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops.

Silence again.

Patterson reaches the far side of the fence.

Now the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are 
outside, directly across from Patterson.

CUT TO

REDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going 
on, it's sure as hell odd.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out 
violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just 
before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one-

-now a different sound is heard: scratching-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound-

-the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the 
ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their 
buckets.

CUT TO

THE GATE. More pressure against it- it could give way any moment.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON and from the look on Redbeard's face, this 
is it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we-

CUT TO

THE CATTLE, going nuts and then-

CUT TO

THE GATE. All pressure gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Patterson is furious.

				PATTERSON
		Goddammit!

				REDBEARD
		It's all right. Stay ready.
			(indicates the blood)
		They know it's there.

Patterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon.

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption.

				REDBEARD
			(going to him)
		Meant to ask you- the railroad car
		trap. Your idea?
			(Patterson nods)
		Excellent notion- I used the same
		device myself once.

				PATTERSON
		But of course yours worked.

				REDBEARD
		In point of fact it didn't- but I'm
		convinced the idea is sound.

He goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and 
for the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to 
lift.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL

and an ORDERLY, blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the 
fire and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before 
he can scream-

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS suddenly beside him, and their giant 
paws slap out so fast we can't follow and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY, dropping to the ground, and now we're starting 
to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning.

CUT TO

A TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and

CUT TO

A PAW flashing and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and

CUT TO

A SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed 
face and

CUT TO

TWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, leaping on them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and

CUT TO

A SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream-

-the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry 
we've heard and

CUT TO

THE ENTIRE CAMP, NIGHT, WITH ALL THE FIRES BURNING- AND 
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA IS CLOSE BY-

-but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it 
and he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel 
does his best to stop him-

-but Hawthorne rips free and we

CUT TO

A SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and

CUT TO

THE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and

CUT TO

MEDICINE, flying across the tent and

CUT TO

GLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and

CUT TO

A BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those 
terrible bright blazing eyes and

CUT TO

A TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: 
destroying the New Hospital and

CUT TO

MORE TENTS collapsing and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.

CUT TO

SHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we

CUT TO

THE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring 
around-

CUT TO

THE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone-

-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New 
Hospital and the instant they are heard

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open 
and they're off as we

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) 
The tents are all down. The place is devastated.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on.

CUT TO

PAN ALONG THE TENT

Dead. Blood. Pain.

PAN TO THE SECOND TENT

More dead.

More dying.

It's a slaughterhouse.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his 
last.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at 
each other-

-then they slow.

Because the New Hospital has come into view.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, CLOSE UP, staring at the disaster.

And this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's 
going to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands 
there. Just stands there. Unable to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos.

He stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere. 
Hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone.

All that's left now is this: the sound of pain.

HOLD.

Dust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains.

Now different sounds take over-

-an incredible babble of human voices.

AND A RAILROAD TRAIN.

Patterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his 
face, is a few steps behind.

We are at the STATION AREA and it is jammed. A train has pulled 
into the station-

-only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are 
workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber 
up onto the roofs of the cars-

-covering the cars-

-everyone is leaving-

-Patterson can only watch.

Abdullah stands on one of the cars-

-the train begins to pull out of the station.

More and more workers chase after it, get pulled on.

Now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full.

Patterson still watches, eyes vacant.

Abdullah sees him, looks away.

The train gathers speed.

Rounds a corner...

...gone...

Patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close 
behind him, the worried look still there.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL.

A FEW AFRICAN ORDERLIES do the best they can. Patterson watches 
only a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him.

CUT TO

THE CAMP as Patterson walks through. A ghost town now. Only 
Africans remain.

CUT TO

THE CONTRAPTION where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on.

CUT TO

THE ANTHILL IN THE CLEARING where Patterson misfired. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his 
tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.

IT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.

Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he 
never takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE.

It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a 
lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. 
Desolate.

Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as 
he did the night before.

Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, 
wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.

For a moment, neither says a word. Then-

				REDBEARD
			(out of the blue)
		It would have been a beautiful 
		bridge, John. I never noticed 
		before, occupied with other 
		business, I	suppose...
			(He's rambling)
		...never really pay much attention
		to that kind of thing but I've had
		the time today, nothing else on,
		and this... it's graceful and the
		placement couldn't be prettier...
		and...
			(He goes silent now,
			stares off)

				PATTERSON
		You just got hit.
			(Redbeard nods)
		The getting up is up to you- but
		they're only lions-
			(beat)
		-and I'm going after them crack
		of dawn...
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-

-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet 
tall- gorgeous early morning light.

As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the 
cliff.

As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.

THE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the 
rock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of 
course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. 
They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM as they make it over the cliff face. They stand, 
stare out.

CUT TO

WHAT THEY SEE: the world. They move on.

CUT TO

A RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if 
you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on 
their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard 
starts to speak. They don't stop moving.

				REDBEARD
		In my town, when I was little,
		there was a brute, a bully who
		terrorized the place.
			(beat)
		But he was not the problem. He
		had a brother who was worse than
		he. But the brother was not the
		problem.
			(beat)
		One or the other of them was
		usually in jail. The problem came
		when they were both free togther.
		The two became different from
		either alone.
			(beat)
		Alone they were only brutes.
		Together they became lethal,
		together they killed.

				PATTERSON
		What happened to them?

				REDBEARD
			(pause)
		I got big.
			(They move on)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's 
hard going. They help each other.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. 
Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points-

CUT TO

A TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: 
there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used 
it as a regular passage.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a 
word move through it.

CUT TO

THE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: 
a cave.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Dark.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward 
it.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside.

CUT TO

WHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low 
tunnel you have to half-crawl through.

Without a word, they start inside.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. 
Ahead there is light. They move on.

CUT TO

THE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just 
a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear.

Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- 
dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's 
dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck-

				REDBEARD
		Dear God-
			(And on those words-)

CUT TO

THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more-

-and now bones-

-the floor of the place is littered with human bones-

-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones.

				PATTERSON
		Their den?
			(Redbeard nods)
		Have you ever seen anything like
		this?

				REDBEARD
		Nobody's seen anything like this.
		Lions don't have caves like this-
			(beat)
		-they're doing it for pleasure.

CUT TO

SEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave-

-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels-

-something is coming close and coming fast and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the 
sound explodes-

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL-

-shrieks-

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. What the hell is it?

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL- and here they come, screeching and angry-

-bats-

-swarms of them- hundreds of them-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, diving to the ground, lying there amidst 
the bangles and the bones and the skulls-

CUT TO

THE BATS. Circling above them. Screeching louder.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, lying very still, eyeless skulls all 
around, staring.

CUT TO

THE BATS. For a moment, it seems as if they might attack.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND REDBEARD. Waiting, waiting. Then-

CUT TO

THE BATS  back into the tunnel and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, scrambling to their feet.

				REDBEARD
		One of my chief attributes is that
		I'm always calm.

And then without warning, from behind them, a roar-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD spin around, start back toward the entrance 
of the cave-

CUT TO

THE LOW ENTRANCE TUNNEL as they scramble half-crawling through it.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE as they make it, stand straight, look around-

CUT TO

THICK BUSH beyond- another roar and sudden movement and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, entering the thick bush- but carefully, 
because they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from 
anywhere- there is the sound of water-

-slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and 
they're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water 
sound gets stronger- and as they burst clear-

CUT TO

AN AMAZING PLACE- AN AREA OF FLAT ROCK SPLIT UP AHEAD BY A WIDE 
FAST-RUNNING WATERFALL.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They look around. Nothing is there. But 
the spot is wide open, exposed.

				PATTERSON
			(The words pour out)
		Where could it have gone? How
		could it get across the water?
			(looks at Redbeard)
		They're only lions, yes?

				REDBEARD
			(shakes his head; he
			doesn't know)
		Don't they have to be?...

They look around a moment more. Nothing to see-

-they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush. And now-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- who knows where it is but it's there-

-watching Patterson.

HOLD BRIEFLY on The Darkness, then-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. JUST BEFORE DAWN-

-outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. 
Patterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the 
other.

				SAMUEL
			(pointing)
		Both of them over there.

He is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard.

				PATTERSON
		Ever have to use a machan?
			(Redbeard hasn't)
		I did once. In India. We will 
		tonight.
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A CLEARING. LATER IN THE DAY.

Patterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd 
looking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting 
inward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air. 
Redbeard and Samuel approach.

				PATTERSON
		They're used to people in trees,
		not in a clearing.
			(indicating the plank)
		It may be tight.

				REDBEARD
		Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's
		your idea, you go up there.
			(to Samuel)
		Take the others to the water tower
		for the night.

				PATTERSON
		I'll be bait alone?

				REDBEARD
		Yes. And I'll be in some distant
		tree where I can provide no
		assistance whatsoever.
			(beat)
		Can you control your fear?

				PATTERSON
		I'll have to.

				REDBEARD
		I can't control mine- I'd be lost
		without the shame factor driving me.

				PATTERSON
		Was that supposed to make me feel
		better?
			(Redbeard doesn't
			reply. Now-)

CUT TO

A DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER.

THE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan.

Patterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support 
poles- they're rickety.

CUT TO

DUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall.

CUT TO

THE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining 
men who clamber up to the platform on top.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Redbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the 
plank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous.

CUT TO

THE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages 
to sit.

CUT TO

THE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get 
comfortable. He can't.

				REDBEARD
			(glancing around)
		It's certainly the best chance
		they've had to kill you.

				PATTERSON
		You think they'll come then?
			(Redbeard does)
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(not answering)
		Good luck.

				PATTERSON
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Because I think they're after you.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to 
leave.

				PATTERSON
		How many do you think they've 
		killed?

				REDBEARD
			(reluctantly)
		The most of any lions... a 
		hundred...?
			(beat)
		Probably more.
			(Now Redbeard looks
			up at the younger man)
		Johnny...?

They study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been 
through a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when 
they first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand.

				REDBEARD
		Don't fuck up.
			(And he turns, never
			looks back, just goes)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He is alone now.

CUT TO

SHADOWS. Growing longer.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It peers around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel-

-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, 
the world could explode.

CUT TO

THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. 
Nothing unusual.

MOVE IN CLOSER:

Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches.

CUT TO

THE SUN. About to die.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He 
stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, 
giving it color.

CUT TO

THE SUN and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just 
set, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and 
in a blink it isn't. As it drops-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. It's madness that he's up here. And he knows 
it. And that shows.

CUT TO

THE SKY. No moon. Just thick cloud.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. Quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of 
him past the donkey.

CUT TO

THE THICK BUSH BEYOND THE DONKEY. Nothing moves-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at 
the donkey.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. LATER. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DARK.

And now, just the beginning of a mist.

CUT TO

THE SKY. THICKER AND THICKER CLOUDS. LATER STILL. GETTING TOWARD 
MORNING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, 
listening for something, anything-

-but all there is is silence.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It lies still and quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to 
scream.

CUT TO

THE BUSHES AROUND HIM. The mist is getting stronger.

CUT TO

REDBEARD in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing 
mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, listening, listening-

-and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear 
it but to Patterson it might as well be thunder-

-from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a 
twig.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, and it's eyes widen-

HOLD ON THE DONKEY.

Because now something happens that hasn't happened before: 
suddenly there are no colors, only tones-

-because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's 
happening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of 
the lion-

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. Watching the donkey.

And from now on, when we are using PATTERSON'S POINT OF VIEW, 
everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted.

When we are using THE GHOST'S POINT OF VIEW, everything is totally 
clear- and sounds are thunderous.

CUT TO

WHAT PATTERSON SEES: just mist and vaguely, bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey. And CAMERA begins to move closer 
as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be 
some movement in the bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey, very, very close-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but 
the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: THE DONKEY.

HOLD.

Now there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: 
the four legs of the platform.

HOLD.

Now we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together.

HOLD AS THE GHOST AT LAST SEES PATTERSON.

CUT TO

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts-

-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around 
the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He 
half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is 
behind him.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to 
change.

CUT TO

PATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about 
the donkey anymore, it's stalking him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, 
always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know 
he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do 
anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the 
lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite 
seen.)

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to 
let the animal's position out of his sight.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come 
apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on 
turning.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- 
that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, 
almost knocking him off the plank and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and 
he's trying not to fall and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and 
as he starts his leap-

CUT TO

REDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing 
his rifle, firing again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, 
lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes 
and the night has him and

CUT TO

SUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring 
at the ground-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. Blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. More blood and...

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, starting to slow-

CUT TO

STRANGE TERRAIN- huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, 
some of them fifteen feet high, some even higher.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They separate, take different paths 
through the anthills.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Alert. One step at a time.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The same. One step at at time.

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, 
staring down at them both.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they 
might be statues.

CUT TO

THE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them 
and as he does-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, launched in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and-

-and FREEZE.

Freeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky.

HOLD. THen-

CUT TO

SAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT-

-we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment 
when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-

-only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the 
actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead 
animal to the ground-

CUT TO

THE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully, 
and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face.

CUT TO

A PHOTOGRAPHER; loads of bulky equipment. Patterson and Redbeard 
stand behind him, watching him. We're in a lovely spot by the 
river. Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking.

				BEAUMONT
		I think another for posterity-
		this is an important moment in
		my life.

He strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work.

				BEAUMONT
		Understand, I had help-

				PATTERSON
		-not a time for modesty, Bob-

				REDBEARD
		-undeniably your triumph.

				BEAUMONT
		Oh surely there's enough credit
		for us all- let's not forget, you
		did the actual shooting. Of course,
		I hired you, I was the general who
		put the team together. And generals
		are the ones who tend to be
		remembered.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Perhaps you might put your head in
		its mouth, sir- could be a corker.

				BEAUMONT
		Clever idea, I like it.

CUT TO

THE MOUTH OF THE GHOST- it is huge-

-Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the 
enormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we

CUT TO

REDBEARD suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and

CUT TO

BEAUMONT, surprised and frightened-

-he jerks his head away-

-there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's-

-Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, 
humiliated, and as the laughter builds-

CUT TO

THE TENT AREA. NIGHT.

Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them, 
their first, no fear in the vicinity.

It should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of 
champagne.

It should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away 
from the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his 
eyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- 
he is more at ease with the world.

				PATTERSON
			(drunk)
		I never thought I'd say this, but
		I'm glad you came.

				REDBEARD
			(drunk)
		Understood- you realize now you
		could never have done it without
		me.

				PATTERSON
		Actually, I could have done it
		much more easily without you, but
		for whatever reason, I'm glad you
		came.
			(They toast each other)

Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins 
them.

				SAMUEL
			(drunk)
		Where do you go next?

				REDBEARD
		Some Russian princes want to hunt
		the Himalayas. You?

				SAMUEL
		Help finish the railroad.

				PATTERSON
		I want to meet my son- he must be
		what, two months old?

They look at the fire a moment. Then-

				SAMUEL
		Three years I've worked for the
		railroad. Now I don't know why. It
		seemed a good idea once.

				PATTERSON
		I feel the same about the bridge.
		This country certainly didn't ask
		for it, doesn't need it.

				REDBEARD
		Too soon to tell.

They look at him.

				REDBEARD
		My life was shaped because someone
		invented gunpowder. Our lives have
		crossed because two lions went mad.
		But what if in the future the three
		of us do something grand for
		humanity? Was that worth all the
		lives? Too soon to tell.

				SAMUEL
			(drinks)
		Some mysteries should not have 
		solutions.

				REDBEARD
			(finishes his bottle,
			rises, looks at Patterson)
		Hold your son high.
			(And he turns, goes
			to his tent)

				PATTERSON
			(beat- quietly)
		He has children?

				SAMUEL
			(beat- quietly)
		Once...
			(HOLD on the two
			in the firelight. Then-)

CUT TO

THE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE 
NEXT DAY.

				FEMALE VOICE (over)
		I'd like to see John Patterson,
		please.
			(As he looks up-)

CUT TO

HELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but 
still lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is 
adorable.

				HELENA
		Could you tell him that his wife-
			(catches herself, smiles)
		-that his family has come to see him.
			(On that-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- 
Patterson takes off running and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back 
and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all 
but her heels.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station 
area.

CUT TO

HELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the 
building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, excitedly waving back and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly screaming "Get back- back-"

CUT TO

HELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- 
she smiles again, waves again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, "GET BACK" and

CUT TO

HELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the 
same, she stops and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child.

CUT TO

HELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, starting to run and

CUT TO

PATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get 
there, he's never going to get there-

CUT TO

HELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she 
turns-

-but too late, too late as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in agony.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as 
Helena cries out helplessly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crying out helplessly and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON IN HIS TENT,

continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had 
is over-

-he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE. It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the 
dream. He looks around.

Redbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it-

CUT TO

INSIDE THE TENT. It's empty. Patterson stares around-

-there is blood on the tent floor and quickly-

CUT TO

THE SUN. RISING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON running wildly, rifle in hand and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash 
across a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, 
widening the area of search and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, veering off and

CUT TO

THORN TREES, as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the 
damage to his clothes or his skin and

CUT TO

MORE THORNS- he plunges wildly ahead and

CUT TO

A LARGE ANTHILL- it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- 
Patterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it-

-nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working 
overtime and is only getting worse-

Patterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do-

-and then SAMUEL'S VOICE on the wind- calling to him-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, 
louder-

-Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend-

CUT TO

A FIELD OF WHITE GRASS. So lovely.

With one patch in the middle that is blood red.

Something is moving in the blood red area.

Patterson has his rifle ready-

-and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen 
something beyond imagination.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to 
where Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down 
into the grass-

-clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and 
Samuel stare mute at one another-

-and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar 
of The Darkness. They don't even react.

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.

We should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this 
before.

START PULLING BACK.

Samuel stands there, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK.

Patterson stands there too, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

REDBEARD'S FUNERAL PYRE. Flames consume the body.

Just Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there.

The flames lick at the sky...

HOLD...

CUT TO

A LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING 
DARK NOW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use 
at the bridge, not far from the baboon.

				PATTERSON
		You're positive lions hate baboons?
			(Samuel is)
		Pebbles?
			(Samuel holds up a bag)
		Let's get it over with.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, 
fifteen feet from the baboon.

They help each other into position. Almost night.

CUT TO

THE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into 
the darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble 
toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but 
irritation-

CUT TO

THE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S 
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries 
out.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; 
only nervous energy is keeping him going now.

CUT TO

THE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and 
frightening black clouds gather and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky 
is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to 
hallucinate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM.

Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.

CUT TO

THE RIVER, raging and black and lethal.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hallucinating again.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge 
toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Firing-

CUT TO

-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and-

CUT TO

-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, 
turning back, ready to fire again-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around.

				PATTERSON
		Where is it?

				SAMUEL
			(pointing down)
		Underneath.
			(beat)
		Somewhere.

CUT TO

WHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes 
several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run.

They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we

CUT TO

EARLY MORNING LIGHT.

Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to 
the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson 
releases the baboon which races away.

CUT TO

WHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began 
construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away 
before them.

CUT TO

They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully...

..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, 
making sure they miss nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Ready for anything.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing.

CUT TO

THE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their 
breaths.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

A SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it.

CUT TO

THE SCAFFOLDING. Nothing is visible.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL- Frozen. They listen-

-nothing but their breathing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around everywhere.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, looking this way, that way.

SHOCK CUT TO

THE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson 
falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it 
gets up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle-

-only Samuel isn't there-

-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS ROARING AND

CUT TO

PATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the 
narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without 
slipping or falling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it 
takes off after Patterson and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the 
nearest tree and

CUT TO

PATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a 
dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary 
speed, it's still faster than Patterson and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and

CUT TO

THE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's 
just up ahead and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing and

CUT TO

THE TREE, and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, springing into the air now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both 
hands, swinging his body up as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the 
branch and now comes this insane roar and

CUT TO

SAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen 
feet up.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's 
tree, raging with frustration.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks 
across at the next tree not far away where Samuel is-

				SAMUEL
			(embarrassed)
		Afraid of lions.

CUT TO

PATTERSON.

				PATTERSON
		It's all right, Samuel- we all
		get hit-
			(Now he shuts up 
			fast and-)

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb 
the tree after Patterson. Lions are cats and when they want to 
climb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going 
up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, 
climbing higher and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there 
is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, going still higher but the branches are getting thinner 
and the tree is shaking, and he could fall-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing on, nothing can stop it-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS, together in the tree, and there's no 
further Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but 
slowly it moves in and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, calling out-

				PATTERSON
		Samuel!
			(And he gestures for
			the rifle and the
			instant he does-)

CUT TO

SAMUEL, and he takes the rifle between his two hands and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, steadily moving in and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less 
than fifteen feet away and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hands out to catch it and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, both hands ready and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, almost on Patterson now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long 
way and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a 
lot of choices in this world and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, staring as Patterson falls and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg 
broken and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn 
but it does and

CUT TO

PATTERSON crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he 
reaches the weapon, grabs for it and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, skittering down the tree and as it reaches the 
ground

CUT TO

PATTERSON, forcing himself to his feet and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its 
charge.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, aims, fires and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and down it goes again but up it comes 
again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing the final shot and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and it has to stop, it just has to-

-but it doesn't.

It roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON; all bullets gone, no place to hide.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Still moving forward.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a 
branch, lands hard and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now 
four, now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless on the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-

-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge 
teeth into the branch-

-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Can't breathe.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. And suddenly he just empties and tears pour 
down his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with 
sobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS. Just the sound of Patterson's tears...

HOLD.

KEEP HOLDING.

CAMERA BEGINS TO RISE-

-WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BRIDGE NOW- AND IT'S FINISHED!

-hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it-

-Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile-

-and Patterson's there, too. He stands with Helena, his young son 
in his arms.

Everybody smiles, everybody waves, the train goes triumphantly by.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He looks wonderful again, vibrant and young. Watching 
him, you might think he hadn't been through the nightmare as he 
stands there, holding the boy tightly.

But with his other hand, he fingers the lion claw necklace...

HOLD ON PATTERSON.

Now slowly dissolve to an African evening. Animals stretch from 
one horizon to the other.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Here we still wonder about them.
		How did they escape for nine months?
		And kill 135 men? And stop the
		railroad?
			(beat)
		And were they only lions?
			(beat)
		If you want to decide for yourself,
		you must go to America. They are at
		the Field Museum in Chicago, and
		even now, after they have been dead
		a century, if you dare to lock eyes
		with them...
			(beat)
		...you will be afraid.

In the distance, the animals continue to move.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Sleep well.

HOLD ON THE ANIMALS. They seem to go on forever...

FINAL FADE OUT.


THE END
"THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS"

by

William Goldman



FADE IN ON

A TINY FIGURE OF A MAN hurrying toward camera. The figure gets 
larger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or 
where we are.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		This is the most famous true story
		of Africa. It happened a hundred
		years ago, but even now, when
		children ask about it, you do not
		tell them at night.
			(The FIGURE continues 
			to grow)
		It began with the race to build a
		railroad across Africa.
			(beat)
		But this is not about building a
		railroad- it is about Patterson.

And now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, 
serious about his life, serious about his career. He has been 
successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his 
talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody.

AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND.

More specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant 
building - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, 
everything is clean and in order.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		Patterson was thirty. A brilliant
		engineer. A fine man, but do not
		become attached to him- there are
		many fine men in this story but do
		not become attached to any of them.
			(beat)
		So many of them die.

Patterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits.

				MALE VOICE (over)
		And remember this: only the
		impossible parts of what follows
		really happened...
			(Now the door opens
			and we-)

CUT TO

Just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is 
ROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his 
office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are 
maps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside.

				BEAUMONT
			(The great smile flashes)
		John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm
		Robert Beaumont.
			(They shake hands)
		Firm- I like that, tells me a lot
		about you-
			(beat)
		-now why don't you tell me about me?
		To get you started, many people find
		me handsome, with a wonderful smile.
		I'm sure you agree.
			(Surprised, uncomfortable,
			Patterson nods)
		Winning personality, heaps of charm?

				PATTERSON
		My wife is the game player in the
		family, sir.

				BEAUMONT
		Games?
			(staring dead at Patterson)
		Look at me closely, Patterson: I am
		a monster. My only pleasure is
		tormenting people who work for me,
		such as yourself.
			(again the smile - only
			now it's chilling)
		One mistake and I promise you this:
		I'll make you hate me.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he realizes Beaumont is serious. Beaumont turns 
sharply and moves to a large map.

CUT TO

THE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear 
line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles.

				BEAUMONT
			(pointing along the line)
		We are building this railroad
		across Africa for the glorious
		purpose of saving Africa from the
		Africans. And, of course, to end
		slavery. The Germans and French
		are our competition. We are ahead,
		and we will stay ahead providing
		you do what I hired you to do-

CUT TO

A MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at "Tsavo," 130 miles in.

				BEAUMONT
		-build the bridge over the Tsavo
		river. And be finished in four
		months time. Can you do that?

				PATTERSON
		I'm sure you've examined my record.
		So you know I've never yet been
		late on a bridge.

				BEAUMONT
		You've never built in Africa.

				PATTERSON
		But I have in India- every country
		presents problems.

				BEAUMONT
		You'll need your confidence, I
		promise you.

				PATTERSON
		I've got a reason far beyond
		confidence: my wife is having our
		firstborn in five months and I
		promised I'd be with her when the
		baby comes.

				BEAUMONT
		Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched
		you confided in me.
			(beat)
		But I don't really give a shit about
		your upcoming litter. I've made you
		with this assignment-
			(the smile)
		-don't make me break you.

				PATTERSON
			(smiling right back)
		You won't have the chance.
			(glancing at his watch)
		Any further words of encouragement?
			(silence)
		Then I've a train to catch.

They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear 
they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we

CUT TO

A RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER

A train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. 
Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around.

CUT TO

HELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the 
kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not 
begun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into 
his arms.

				HELENA
		I tried to be late, John- it would
		have been easier if you'd gone.

				PATTERSON
			(They are nutty about
			each other - he nods)
		We're not much good at goodbyes, 
		Helena.

				HELENA
			(brightly)
		Tell me about Beaumont- does he
		understand how brilliant you are,
		how lucky he is to have you?

				PATTERSON
		It was embarrassing- the man showered
		me with compliments.

They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a 
quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-

				HELENA
		Oh dear-
			(beat)
		-you're geting that downtrodden look
		again-

				PATTERSON
		-well, it's just...
			(beat)
		...other men don't abandon their wives
		at such a time-

				HELENA
			(not unkindly)
		-oh please- if I'd been against your
		taking this, you would have abandoned
		me. You've been desperate to see Africa
		your whole life.

				PATTERSON
		What if there are complications?-

				HELENA
		-not "what if"- there will be, there
		always are. Which only means that our
		"son" and I- note my confidence- will
		have an excuse to come visit.

THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.

				HELENA
		Go, now.
			(He kisses her hand)
		Such a gentleman.
			(Now he holds her)

				PATTERSON
		I am desperate to see Africa- but I
		hate the leaving.

CUT TO

HELENA. She hates it, too.

				HELENA
		You build bridges, John-
			(beat)
		-you've got to go where the rivers are.

They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into 
each other's arms a final time, then-

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam-

-Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears.

HOLD FOR A MOMENT.

KEEP HOLDING.

Patterson runs out of the steam and we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A DIFFERENT TRAIN, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT WORLD.

This is the train to TSAVO and Patterson is alone on the engine 
seat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad 
inspectors and visiting VIPs. Behind it is a white circular piece 
of wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers.

CUT TO

NIGEL STARLING, running as best as he can alongside the train, 
trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat.

STARLING is a terribly appealing young man. Clothes do not fit him 
well, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that 
shirttail, trying to get things right. He wears glasses, tends 
nonetheless to squint at the world. He is, above all, a good man, 
morally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian 
times.

				STARLING
			(as Patterson helps
			him aboard)
		Many thanks.
			(squints)
		You're Patterson, yes?
			(Patterson nods)
		Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you
		at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must
		have told you that.

				PATTERSON
		He just gave me his "monster" speech.

				STARLING
		That. I know Robert seems dreadful, 
		but when you truly get to know the man,
		well, he's much worse.
			(beat)
		And I'm one of his defenders.
			(Patterson smiles)
		Forget him for now- it's your first
		ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it
		breathtaking.
			(And on that word-)

CUT TO

STARLING coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked 
with dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary 
desert.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting toward Starling)
		"Breathtaking" doesn't begin to do it
		justice.
			(As Starling starts to
			laugh, his mouth opens
			and sand flies in, and
			his coughing fit returns
			and)

CUT TO

THE DESERT. ENDLESS. LATER IN THE DAY.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust 
gets worse- a wind has kicked up.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN, TRYING TO MAKE IT UP A STEEP GRADE. STILL LATER.

Patterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping 
to push it, trudging through the dust. All the other passengers 
spread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs 
all the assistance it can get.

CUT TO

INSIDE A RAILROAD CAR, EARLY EVENING.

Patterson and Starling, filthy, sit together. Starling has nodded 
off. Patterson has a book open in his lap-

-we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that 
accurate.

Now Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps.

CUT TO

THE TRAIN POUNDING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

Stokers shovel coal. They are exhausted but they keep at it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. WAKING IN THE CAR, RUBBING HIS EYES. IT'S DAWN.

He stares out-

-and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And 
now, at last-

CUT TO

SOMETHING SPECIAL- and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first 
view of the Africa of his imagination.

Because the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees 
and one more thing-

-bursts of animals. On both sides of the train.

A flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing 
there amazing leap there.

Patterson is like a kid in a candy store.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, back outside in the engine seat again. 
Starling points-

				STARLING
		Aren't they amazing?

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S POINTING AT: Some giraffes running along, their absurd 
shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly 
long strides.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, staring out.

				PATTERSON
		You know the most amazing thing
		about them?- they only sleep five
		minutes a day.
			(Starling glances at him-
			clearly, he didn't know that)

CUT TO

A FAMILY OF HYENAS. Close by, loping in their scary way.

				STARLING
		Don't much like them.

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		The females are bigger- only animal
		here like that- have to be or they
		wouldn't survive because the males
		eat the young.

CUT TO

STARLING studying Patterson. Clearly, he didn't know that, either.

CUT TO

SOME HIPPOS moving along. Starling turns to Patterson.

				STARLING
		Anything special about them?

				PATTERSON
		Just that they fart through their
		mouths.
			(beat)
		Must make kissing something of a
		gamble.

				STARLING
			(laughs)
		I've lived in Africa a year and I
		don't know what you know. How long
		have you been here?

				PATTERSON
			(looks at his watch)
		Almost three hours.
			(beat)
		But I've been getting ready all my
		life.
			(Now, from them-)

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children 
who wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished 
looking than their mothers.

				STARLING
			(suddenly touched)
		Every time I see something like that,
		I know we're right to be here- to
		bring Christianity into their lives,
		enrich their souls.

				PATTERSON
		Beaumont says it's to end slavery.

				STARLING
			(shrugs)
		We all have our reasons. Mine is 
		simply to make them understand 
		happiness, accept salvation, know the 
		serenity that comes-
			(interrupts himself)
		-best I stop. One of the by-products 
		of my belief is that I can become 
		amazingly boring. But I know God smiles 
		on me.

				PATTERSON
			(They really like each other)
		Have you got that in writing?
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, laughs. And now-)

CUT TO

A WHITE CLAW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Hundreds of white claws.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

They aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and 
they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree.

And there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in 
with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked 
red rocks-

-now the train begins to slow.

Smoke drifts across.

A bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks.

				STARLING (over)
		Welcome to Tsavo.
			(on the word)

CUT TO

TSAVO.

We have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a 
place that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water 
tower is under construction-

-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for 
work.

THE TRAIN goes slower still.

No one stands idly around here.

But no one looks happy either.

ONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL.

An ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light 
the world.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train.

				STARLING
			(indicating Samuel,
			who is approaching)
		Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely
		indispensable- the only man here
		everyone trusts.

				PATTERSON
			(softly)
		Does he speak English?

				SAMUEL
			(not softly enough)
		And very poor French.

				STARLING
			(introducing)
		Samuel- John Patterson.

				SAMUEL
			(as they shake)
		The bridgebuilder-
			(gesturing to the 
			working men)
		-we have been getting ready for 
		you.

				PATTERSON
		Excellent. Could I see the bridge
		site?
			(Samuel nods)

				STARLING
		I've got medical supplies to
		deliver. Come along to the hospital
		when you're done.
			(starting off)

				SAMUEL
		I will bring him, Nigel.

We should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at 
the very beginning of the picture.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower.

Standing on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely 
powerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH.

WORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, 
some SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling.

				PATTERSON
		Why do the workers look unhappy?

				SAMUEL
		Because they are here.
			(beat)
		Because Tsavo is the worst place in
		the world.
			(He points ahead)
		Come, John- to the bridge.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along.

CUT TO

THE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it.

And here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot 
where the movie takes place was like.

There were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived 
in a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have 
come from the same town back in their country might choose to live 
in one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another 
cluster.

What we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are 
dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, 
these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)

The places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's 
living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where 
the bridge is to be built, etc., etc.

As they move, Samuel points out various camps.

A SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer.

ANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating.

A GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area.

Anyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a 
wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more.

Okay, back to the story.

				PATTERSON
			(as they pass the INDIAN
			tent area where prayer is
			starting)
		It's all wonderfully under control,
		Samuel- you've done a splendid job.

				SAMUEL
		Thank you. The truth is this: you
		have to work at it constantly.

				PATTERSON
		The workers don't get on?

				SAMUEL
		Get on? They detest each other.
		Obviously the Africans hate the
		Indians. But the Indians also hate
		the other Indians. Some of them
		worship cows, while others eat them.
			(As they move on)

CUT TO

RAILROAD TRACK.

PAN ALONG TO

MORE RAILROAD TRACK.

KEEP PANNING

And suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The 
track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where 
it just stops-

-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, 
is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of 
track.

				SAMUEL
			(to the far side)
		Railhead is across there.

CUT TO

THE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great 
clouds of dust.

				SAMUEL
		Three thousand men laying track- when
		the bridge is done, it all joins up.

Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at 
the space where the bridge is to be.

				SAMUEL
		Did it look like this in your mind?

				PATTERSON
			(shakes his head)
		This is more difficult-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited.

				PATTERSON
			(eyes bright)
		-but how wonderful that it's 
		difficult, it should be difficult- 
		what better job in all the world
		than build a bridge?- make things
		connect- bring worlds together- and
		get it right!
			(Now from Patterson-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT

as Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around-

-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured 
or with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, 
everything is working well, everything is under control. Starling 
approaches.

				STARLING
		Finish your tour?

				PATTERSON
			(nods)
		And anxious to get started.
			(indicating the hospital)
		What is this, mostly malaria?

				STARLING
		Yes- but their suffering is only
		transitory- once they except God
		into their hearts, He will vanquish
		all pain.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		That's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the
		poor bastards will relapse if you keep
		on that way.
			(As they turn-)

CUT TO

DOCTOR DAVID HAWTHORNE. A tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy 
drinker. A man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years.

				HAWTHORNE
			(to Patterson)
		I'm David Hawthorne, this is my
		hospital. And my advice to you is,
		"don't get sick in front of it."
			(beat)
		That was meant to be charming, 
		sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.

				STARLING
		You never had it.

				HAWTHORNE
		Nigel and I don't like each other much.

				SAMUEL
			(breaking the tension)
		I am also liaison between these two.

				PATTERSON
			(to Hawthorne)
		Clearly you don't agree about building
		the railroad?

				HAWTHORNE
		This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it?
		It's only being built to control the
		ivory trade, make men richer.

				PATTERSON
		Then why do you stay?

				HAWTHORNE
		Who else would hire me?
			(to Starling)
		Beat you to it, didn't I?
			(beat)
		Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a
		little welcoming gift.
			(Now he gestures and we-)

CUT TO

A NERVOUS ORDERLY who approaches them. He has been freshly 
bandaged across one shoulder.

				HAWTHORNE
		This is Karim, one of my orderlies-
		attacked by a man-eater earlier
		today- first incident of that kind
		here.

Patterson says not a word, just studies the wounded man.

				STARLING
			(incredulous)
		A man-eater attacks and you're such
		a buffoon you almost forget to mention
		it?

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, he got away, didn't he?
			(to Patterson)
		Riding a donkey not far from here 
		when the lion sprang on them- donkey 
		took the brunt of it- then suddenly 
		the lion ran off.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Listening. No emotion on his face.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's kind of enjoying this. Bearing down.

				HAWTHORNE
		I know it's your first day and of
		course you must be tired from the
		journey-
			(beat)
		-but what are you going to do about
		it?

				PATTERSON
			(a long pause, then evenly-)
		Karim will have to show me where it
		happened. And of course, I'll need
		the donkey.
			(beat)
		With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
			(And he walks out, leaving
			an astonished Starling
			staring after him)

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And 
there are half a dozen ORDERLIES.

Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. 
Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches.

				STARLING
		I couldn't believe it when you said
		"sort it out." As if it were the most
		normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum,
		what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a
		killer beast this evening, nothing
		much else going on anyway."

				PATTERSON
		Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he?
		But that's all right- after all, I'm
		responsible for everything that happens
		here. And it certainly won't do much
		for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.

He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. 
There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY 
COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with 
precision. He arranges his books precisely too.

Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order.

				STARLING
			(calling out)
		You said "of course" you'd need the
		donkey. Why "of course"?

				PATTERSON
			(taking a rifle,
			moving outside)
		We know three things about man-eaters.
		First, they always return to where
		they've attacked before. Second, they're
		always old- they can't catch other 
		animals so they turn to us. And third,
		they're always alone- they've been cast
		out by their pride because they can't
		keep up.

CUT TO

STARLING, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited. 
But also a bit reluctant.

				STARLING
		I don't suppose I could watch.

				PATTERSON
			(delighted)
		Might be exciting for you.

				STARLING
		I've never been all that adventurous.
		I wouldn't be in the way?

				PATTERSON
		I'd love the company. And I've hunted
		all my life.

				STARLING
			(gathering courage)
		Well, why not? You seem so calm and
		experienced.
			(standing, teacup in hand)
		Why not, indeed!
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A SLIGHTLY WOUNDED DONKEY

It's roped loosely to a tree, bells around its neck. When it 
moves, they make a sound. Middle of the night. A night wind.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

We're in a clearing with thick trees all around.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND STARLING, seated uncomfortably in a tree on the edge 
of the clearing, twelve feet up in the air. Patterson has his 
rifle ready. This next is all whispered.

				STARLING
			(embarrassed)
		I hate to be a bother, John, but the
		cramp's getting worse.
			(Pulls up his trousers-
			his leg is knotted)
		The pain is actually quite unbearable
		now.

				PATTERSON
		Shhh.

				STARLING
		I'm sure you mean that to be comforting,
		but-

				PATTERSON
			(interrupting)
		-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.

				STARLING
		That is precisely my plan- but back in
		my tent.
			(And he begins to climb down)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, grabbing him.

				PATTERSON
		They own the night- nobody moves when
		there's a man-eater out there.

Starling glumly obeys. Then-

				STARLING
		John? I know this isn't the time to ask,
		but-

				PATTERSON
		What?

				STARLING
		Since you'd only been here three hours
		when we met, are you sure this is how
		you hunt lions?

				PATTERSON
		Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse
		than you think- I've never even seen one.

CUT TO

STARLING, not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries 
to get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at 
the night.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

The donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as 
moved.

Now the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little.

And the donkey is suddenly awake and scared-

-and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears 
from the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound 
EXPLODES-

-and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked 
but unhurt-

-he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it.

				STARLING
			(amazed)
		...one shot...

				PATTERSON
			(even more amazed)
		So that's what a lion looks like.
			(Now from the tree-)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL TENT AREA - JUST AFTER DAWN

HOLD for a moment.

				SAMUEL (over)
		One shot- one-

KEEP HOLDING

Now Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited-

-it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile.

				SAMUEL
		Patterson has made the nights safe
		again.

KEEP HOLDING FOR JUST A MOMENT MORE.

As he walks on, behind him come THREE COOLIES carrying the body of 
the lion. As dozens of men come running in from all over to see 
the dead man-eater-

				SAMUEL
			(mimes shooting)
		BOOM!
			(Now as the crowd
			continues to grow-)

CUT TO

A ROUGH ENGINEER'S DRAWING OF WHAT WILL BE THE BRIDGE

It has two embankments on either side of the river.

These embankments are big- forty feet wide, fifty feet high.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING standing on the high ground where the 
embankment will start. From here, there is a slope down to the 
river itself.

Also present is UNGAN SIGNH, who we saw earlier standing 
precariously atop the water tower. Singh, enormously powerful, is 
another assistant. Bright, a great worker, another main character 
in what is to follow.

Now Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river- 
it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother 
him. He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who 
move down with him.

Singh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat. Starling does 
not, slipping and sliding.

				PATTERSON
			(gesturing)
		All right, I'd like to start the
		embankments today-
			(to Singh)
		-sufficient supplies on hand?

				SINGH
			(nods)
		More than.

				STARLING
		With much more on the way-
			(loses balance, falls)
		-John- we could have had this chat on
		flatter ground-

				PATTERSON
		-true enough- but without the comedy
		relief.
			(Starling, amazingly good
			natured, smiles, gets
			back up)

CUT TO

THE RIVER as they scramble down to it.

CUT TO

THE SLOPE they've come down- it's a long way back to the top.

CUT TO

THE THREE MEN. It's a glorious morning.

				PATTERSON
		How lucky we are.

				STARLING
		Aren't we full of ourselves today?
			(beat)
		I think it's because of the lion.

				PATTERSON
		Possibly.

				SINGH
			(soft)
		You know, I too have killed a lion.

				STARLING
		How many shots did you need?

CUT TO

SINGH. Almost embarrassed.

				SINGH
		I used my hands.

He holds his big hands up, palms out. Starling looks at Singh to 
see if he means it-

-he means it all right. Now, from Starling's perpetually surprised 
face-

CUT TO

SURVEYING EQUIPMENT

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON sighting through it- we are on the far side of the river 
now. Singh is there, Starling, too.

Behind them: a field of tall grass.

				PATTERSON
		All right- thee second embankment
		will go there.
			(He gestures toward
			the river)

				STARLING
		You do plan to mark it a bit more
		precisely than just-
			(imitating Patterson)
		-"there."

				PATTERSON
			(smiling)
		In your honor, Nigel. And you and
		Singh will be in charge of building
		them- and you'll also build the
		roadbeds and the three foundation
		pillars- and you'll be finished in
		eight thrilling weeks.

				STARLING
			(very dubious)
		John, it will not be easy.

				PATTERSON
		Nigel, you'll just have to use your
		hands-
			(And he smiles, repeating
			Singh's gesture, both 
			palms out)

CUT TO

SINGH. He smiles back, starts to reply. But his words stop, his 
smile dies. He just stares and we-

CUT TO

WHAT HE'S STARING AT- the surrounding field of tall grass. Nothing 
unusual about it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stares, too.

CUT TO

THE FIELD OF TALL GRASS- suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a 
fresh wind.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Silent. As before. Starling follows his glance.

CUT TO

SINGH. Frozen.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. And now the field is making odd patterns- as if 
something unseen were moving through.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. Nothing visible. But the odd pattern seems to be making 
its way across the field.

CUT TO

SINGH AND STARLING. Quiet. Just the wind.

CUT TO

THE FIELD. The odd pattern seems to stop. Around it, the wind 
makes different shapes of the grass.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at 
the spot where the pattern stopped.

CUT TO

SINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to 
shiver, as if from cold.

CUT TO

THE BUILDING SEQUENCE

And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity.

Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and 
driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments.

And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as 
the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in 
the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there.

And alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with 
glasses and very bright eyes.

Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that 
is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to 
help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the 
clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with 
it, does well.

And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but 
mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the 
placements of the three stone foundation pillars-

-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- 
and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the 
start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor-

-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes-

-which is all he wears from now on.

And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, 
working with the power of three-

-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and 
Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded-

-it's hard, brutal work-

-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge 
skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work 
on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three 
foundation pillars are taking shape-

CUT TO

TONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to 
complete the embankments. As this goes on-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is 
going very quickly.

Patterson stops working, looks across the river-

-movement in the grassy area on the far side.

CUT TO

SEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to 
Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little 
men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL watching them.

				PATTERSON
		What are they looking at?

				SAMUEL
		You- they cannot believe you're
		still here.

				PATTERSON
		Nonsense.

				SAMUEL
		You don't know what Tsavo means, do
		you?
			(Patterson doesn't)
		It means "slaughter"...

CUT TO

THE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads.

CUT TO

THE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and 
pushed into shape.

CUT TO

THE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished.

CUT TO

THE ROADBED. The same.

CUT TO

THE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and

CUT TO

THE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last-

CUT TO

-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the 
river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other.

And they all look at each other- the embankments are both 
finished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying-

-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, 
in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password.

HOLD. A big moment for them all!

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT AREA

He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate 
is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat.

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA

Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too.

CUT TO

SINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep.

CUT TO

STARLING is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep 
already.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in his tent, closing his eyes.

CUT TO

SINGH, deep asleep in his tent-

-he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep. 
They lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the 
center pole, feet toward the edges of the tent.

HOLD ON SINGH. It's very dark. HE AND HIS MEN just lie motionless, 
breathing deeply.

KEEP HOLDING.

Now the CAMERA moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking 
down at the circle of men.

KEEP HOLDING.

They don't move, not even an inch. The steady breathing is the 
only sound.

YES, KEEP HOLDING.

KEEP HOLDING.

Nothing is going on down there. Nothing at all.

KEEP HOLDING.

Not a goddamn thing.

KEEP ON HOLDING. KEEP ON HOLDING.

And now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide-

-and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by 
some giant invisible wire-

CUT TO

SINGH. CLOSE UP. Screaming.

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT, waking, staring around and

CUT TO

SINGH as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams 
grow even louder as we

CUT TO

THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT and it's like a bomb just went off, they 
rise, spin, cry out, stare-

CUT TO

THE NIGHT OUTSIDE AND SINGH'S BODY sliding along the ground. It's 
pitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's 
going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's 
making this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so 
dark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is 
in our way and

CUT TO

UP AHEAD, some bushes and

CUT TO

SINGH, his body going faster than before and his cries are 
weakening-

-CUT TO

THE NIGHT and his body and there is no sound at all coming from 
him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making 
this happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man 
as it skims along and-

CUT TO

UP AHEAD NOW, a low clump of bushes.

CUT TO

SINGH'S BODY, coming closer and

CUT TO

THE BUSHES and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn 
bushes and now-

CUT TO

SINGH, suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying 
over the bushes and gone!

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, early morning, their rifles held in front 
of them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and

CUT TO

THE GROUND. At first we can't make out much. Then we can- a spot 
of red.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND STARLING, hurrying on again.

CUT TO

THORN TREES, and as they force their way through them-

CUT TO

A LARGE VULTURE, wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth-

-HOLD-

-as it lands we can see A DOZEN OTHER VULTURES are already there, 
surrounding something-

-but we can't make it out. We are in an area of grass and shadow-

-and specks of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, cries out in shock and fury, fires his rifle, races 
forward.

CUT TO

THE VULTURES screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch 
them soar into the morning sky-

				HAWTHORNE'S VOICE (over)
		What the lion must have done, once 
		he'd killed Singh, was lick his skin 
		off so he could drink his blood-

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

Hawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, 
but he's clearly upset- it's awful.

				HAWTHORNE
		-then he feasted on him, starting
		with his feet-

				STARLING
			(evenb more upset)
		-please- you needn't be so graphic-

				HAWTHORNE
		You intend "sorting this out" tonight?

				PATTERSON
		I'll try- but this feels so different-
		that old lion I killed could never
		carry off a man Singh's size.

				STARLING
			(maybe a little alarmed)
		But you said they were always old.

				PATTERSON
		That's what the books say...
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE DARKENING SKY. NOW-

CUT TO

ABDULLAH in tears. Where are we?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

This is Singh's funeral pyre.

Singh's body is being burned.

A LOT OF INDIANS are there. We've caught sight of some of them 
before- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him 
in his tent.

There is a terrible sense of shock.

Patterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by 
the others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final 
time.

CUT TO

THE FLAMES; they continue to rise...

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT

Night. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut 
and tied.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up 
in a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for 
anything. He cannot get comfortable.

CUT TO

THE AREA- nothing, no movement.

CUT TO

SINGH'S TENT. As before.

CUT TO

THE AREA. No sign of movement of any kind. Dead.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but 
there is still darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his 
eyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do-

CUT TO

TWO HUGE YELLOW EYES. That's all we see, just the eyes and they 
are near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down 
and-

CUT TO

THE HUGE YELLOW EYES- only they're gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky.

CUT TO

THE SUN, RISING, THE NIGHT DONE.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back 
toward his tent area. Now he stops.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and a large group of workers- only they're not working. 
They smoke, play cards, sit around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, steaming, going up to Abdullah.

				PATTERSON
		You were contracted to work-

				ABDULLAH
			(gesturing around)
		-malaria epidemic; very sudden.

				PATTERSON
		Let me see the sick.

				ABDULLAH
			(not backing off)
		Oh, you're a doctor now, too?

				PATTERSON
		There is no reason for fear.

				ABDULLAH
		On that I choose to remain dubious.
			(beat)
		Two are dead now in two nights.
			(And on that news-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Rocked. He didn't know. Behind him now, Starling 
hurries up, Samuel alongside.

				PATTERSON
			(to Starling)
		Second death? Where?-

				STARLING
			(gesturing)
		-far end of camp- man wandering alone
		at night. Hawthorne's examining the
		body now.
			(beat)
		There's even less of him than of Singh.

				PATTERSON
			(just shakes his head)
		But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be
		that hungry this soon.
			(getting control- he
			looks to Samuel)
		Samuel?

				SAMUEL
		We should construct thorn fences 
		around every tent area. Fires burning 
		at night.

				PATTERSON
		Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew-
		no one allowed out at night.
			(to Abdullah)
		Send half your men to the bridge, the
		rest with these two.
			(Abdullah nods)
		And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But 
		I repeat- there is no reason for fear. 
		I will kill the lion and I will build 
		the bridge.

				ABDULLAH
		Of course you will, you are white, you
		can do anything...
			(They look at each 
			other. They are not 
			friends. Now-)

CUT TO

THE THORN BUSHES WE SAW ON OUR ARRIVAL TO TSAVO

ENDLESS NUMBERS OF THEM. There is a machete-like sound as we

CUT TO

A BUNCH OF WORKMEN, led by Samuel, chopping down branches. They do 
it with care- these are claws-

CUT TO

-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, 
he's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his 
machete, moving in between bushes and

CUT TO

ONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling 
taking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing-

-his arms are starting to bleed-

-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at 
them, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and 
right now, he is possessed.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward 
the bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY AREA

For a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we 
saw with Singh. Something is making the grass move-

-only now there is no wind... HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know.

CUT TO

STARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His 
clothes are shredded. A WORKER has finished with a section and 
satisfied, moves on-

-but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his 
bare hands and squeezes them together.

				STARLING
		Not good enough- look, it's got to
		be tighter. Tighter.

CUT TO

THE AREA IN WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING. FENCES ARE WELL ALONG TOWARD 
COMPLETION. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON.

PULL UP

We see more fences around more camp areas.

KEEP PULLING UP

The entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual 
areas protected.

The skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast.

Fires start up. Dozens of them.

Still darker.

Now workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety 
before darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, 
dodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, 
get up, run on-

CUT TO

THE SUN. Falling out of the sky.

CUT TO

THE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD.

CUT TO

STARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. 
Samuel is with him. Both are exhausted.

Patterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. 
They stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You 
get the sense these three will be friends forever.

				STARLING
		What a good week.

				PATTERSON
		You mean nobody died?

				STARLING
			(shakes his head)
		We all worked together. Worthy deeds
		were accomplished. I liked the labor.
			(beat)
		My mother insisted on piano lessons-
		broke the dear woman's heart when I
		turned out to be tone deaf- but she
		still was always at me about being
		careful with my hands.
			(looks at them)
		I like the blood, is that strange?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes, I think so.
			(Starling smiles, starts
			to speak)

				PATTERSON
		Look out, Samuel, here it comes.

				STARLING
		Even you two must admit that it is a
		glorious thing, what Man can
		accomplish. When there is a common
		splendid goal, there are no limits.
		Think what we will accomplish when we
		all have God's warmth in our hearts.
			(Samuel's eyes have 
			closed; he begins to snore. 
			Patterson can't help
			laughing)

CUT TO

STARLING. As good natured as ever.

				STARLING
		I am immune to your disdain.
			(He looks at them now)
		When I came here, I had but one small
		goal: to convert the entire continent
		of Africa.
			(shakes his head)
		Now I've decided to move on to
		something really difficult: I will not
		rest until both of you are safely in
		the fold.

				SAMUEL
		I've had four wives, good luck.

				STARLING
		The struggle is the glory...
			(HOLD ON the three friends)

CUT TO

PATTERSON, the next morning, working with Abdullah and some others 
at the bridge.

CUT TO

STARLING completing work on the fence from the day before. It's 
high and taut and he's done a terrific job.

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION

A BUNCH OF OTHER MEN are working near a large grassy field. One of 
the men starts a chant. The others pick it up. It's really pretty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the 
chant comes distantly to him on the wind.

CUT TO

THE WORKMEN CHANTING LOUDER. It's turning into a stunner of a day- 
glorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds.

CUT TO

STARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD. As before-

-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something 
flicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone 
too quickly.

CUT TO

THE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON.

CUT TO

PATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the 
men, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky.

CUT TO

THE GRASSY FIELD-

-and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking 
back in another 180 degree arc-

-still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a 
tail. Now quickly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view. He 
holds an envelope.

				SAMUEL
		For you.

				PATTERSON
			(taking it)
		Thank you, Samuel.

				SAMUEL
			(watching as Patterson
			opens it)
		Good news?

				PATTERSON
			(glancing at the letter)
		I expect so- it's from my wife.

				SAMUEL
		Do you love her?

				PATTERSON
		I do, actually; very much.

				SAMUEL
			(his wonderful smile)
		You give me hope, John.
			(As he walks away-)

CUT TO

STARLING, probing at the thorn fence, searching out any last 
weaknesses.

Behind him now, in the tall grass, something moves.

Starling, intent on his work, notices nothing.

CUT TO

THE SINGING MEN, getting more and more into it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, by the river, reading the letter.

There is a large tree up the riverbank. It casts a large shadow.

In the shadow now, something moves.

Patterson, intent on his reading, notices nothing.

				HELENA (over)
		Darling one- the big excitement
		yesterday was when some school-
		children spotted a whale-
			(pause)
		-they were looking at me, John-

CUT TO

HELENA, in their bedroom, moving across to the window, staring 
out. She now has a considerable stomach.

				HELENA
		That was an attempt at humor but I
		don't feel very funny these days. I
		miss you terribly and after our son-
		I still have total confidence- well,
		after he's born I think travel might
		be broadening. As he kicks me at
		night I'm quite sure he's telling me
		he definitely wants to come to Africa.
			(pause)
		Thought you might need reminding.

CUT TO

PATTERSON by the river. He smiles, folds the letter. Now-

CUT TO

THE SINGING WORKMEN at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they 
sound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound 
even better-

-there must be twenty of them, working and singing-

-and screaming!

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning his head sharply and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE SCREAMING WORKMEN and they're running now, running and 
shrieking and that's all we see, the workmen-

-some of them run left-

-some run right-

-and now a few of them are starting to cry.

CUT TO

A FAT COOLIE running and running, glancing back, screaming louder, 
running on and on and

CUT TO

-a shadow in the grass- no telling what- but it's big and it's 
moving and

CUT TO

THE FAT COOLIE and this next goes so fast it could be a dream- or, 
more accurately, a nightmare-

SHOCK CUT TO

A GIGANTIC WHITE MANED LION as it leaps onto the Fat Coolie, 
brings him to earth, bites his neck in two, kills him, just-like-
that.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, as they race away from the river and

CUT TO

STARLING, running from the fenced area- he holds a rifle in his 
hands.

CUT TO

ANOTER PART OF THE CAMP AND A DIFFERENT BUNCH OF WORKMEN- they 
freeze as the screams reach them and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, on the way to his tent area and

CUT TO

DIFFERENT WORKMEN listening in fear and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing to his tent, grabbing his rifle and cartridges 
and

CUT TO

STARLING, running toward the screaming and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he charges ahead, loading his rifle on the fly and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying more ammunition, running behind Patterson, 
keeping up and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and nothing is visible now- the men are gone and 
from this angle, it looks deserted and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, catching Starling, leading him into the TSAVO STATION 
area, Samuel just behind them.

CUT TO

A RECTANGULAR SHED, ahead of them. They move to it, slow-

-then they stop-

-a sound is heard- from around the corner- the sound continues- 
Patterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the 
crunching of bones.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, checking his rifle.

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same. Samuel, holding the extra ammunition, 
moves close to Patterson. Now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the 
corner and as he does-

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his 
feet-

-then the lion stares toward the shed as we

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right 
with him. THE LION is a good distance away.

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, a low growl coming from him as he takes the 
coolie's body by the shoulder, begins backing away with it.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, dropping to his knees for the shot and

CUT TO

STARLING, doing the same and

CUT TO

THE WHITE LION, growling louder and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, taking aim and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow 
motion-

-Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and-

-and this thing is suddenly there-

-this huge dark thing and it seems to suddenly appear from the 
flat roof of the shed and

CUT TO

THE SUN, blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully 
stretched, it seems to go on forever and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning around to see and

CUT TO

STARLING, turning too, and we're coming back into regular motion 
now as we

CUT TO

This enormous BLACK-MANED LION diving into the three, sending them 
all sprawling and

CUT TO

THE WHITE MANED LION roaring and

CUT TO

THE BLACK MANED LION roaring, running to the other and

CUT TO

THE TWO LIONS IN CLOSE UP.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, for that is how they will be referred 
to-

-and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth-

-The Darkness has eyes that are crazed-

-they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old 
and the young and the fat and the strong-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to 
reach for his rifle and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, the white and the black, as they move 
toward the field of tall grass, roaring and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S RIFLE and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring 
sounds are deafening now and

CUT TO

THE TWO GIGANTIC MALES, backing into the tall grass-

-they roar one final time-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we

CUT TO

THE TALL GRASS and they're gone, the grass is full of moving 
patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing 
this way, that way-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staggering to his feet, staring at the grassy field.

				PATTERSON
			(dazed)
		Jesus, two of them...

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and

CUT TO

STARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the 
young man, then-

CUT TO

THE STATION AREA

A train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly 
chaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of 
the busier parts in camp-

-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with 
several dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting 
for the train.

Patterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah 
and Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them 
walking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same.

				PATTERSON
			(shouting over the noise
			of the approaching train)
		-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-
			(gesturing toward the men
			who stand by the train
			tracks)
		-there's nothing wrong with your men
		so stop telling me there is-

				ABDULLAH
			(advancing on Patterson now)
		-you do not call me a liar- you know
		nothing of their health- consider
		yourself fortunate I persuaded so 
		many to stay- consider yourself 
		fortunate I have decided to stay-

				PATTERSON
			(losing it)
		You think you matter?
			(gesturing toward the
			train which is close to
			stopping now)
		-Beaumont is on that train- he 
		matters-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, moving in on Abdullah now-

				PATTERSON
		He sees this chaos, he'll replace 
		you all.

				ABDULLAH
		He'll replace you, too- that's all 
		you really care about.

				PATTERSON
		You think so? Fine.
			(finished arguing)
		It's best you get out. Go. Tell all 
		your people to go, run home where 
		they'll be safe under the covers and 
		when the bridge is built and the
		railroad is done, they can tell their
		women that out of all the thousands
		who worked here, they were the only
		ones to flee-
			(And he wheels around,
			starts to walk away as we-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. Quiet, staring after Patterson.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Patterson has won. As the two of them exchange a quick 
glance-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT standing in the door of a passenger car, handsome as 
ever. Somehow his clothes are still pressed.

Patterson moves up. In a splendid mood. Samuel is happy too.

				PATTERSON
		Pleasant journey?

				BEAUMONT
			(stepping off the train)
		How could it be? I hate Africa.

Now there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks 
around and we

CUT TO

ABDULLAH and his workmen, moving away from the train- they are 
singing the same song that the workmen sang just before The Ghost 
and The Darkness attacked- it's pretty- but it's also a little 
unnerving.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Listening a moment.

				BEAUMONT
		Lovely sound- they seem happy.

				PATTERSON
		Don't they, though?

				BEAUMONT
		So work must be going well?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He and Samuel share another glance.

				PATTERSON
			(delicately)
		Truthfully?
			(beat)
		There has been the occasional odd
		hiccup- but then, as you so wisely
		told me, I'd never built in Africa.

				BEAUMONT
		But overall, you're pleased?

				SAMUEL
			(moving in)
		I have never experienced anything
		like it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT; almost longingly looks back at the train.

				BEAUMONT
		I almost feel like getting right
		back on.
			(glances at his watch)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. They do not breathe.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He really wants to leave and for a moment it looks like 
he just might.

				BEAUMONT
			(a sigh)
		I suppose it would be a dereliction
		of duty not to at least look around.

Now Abdullah wanders happily by.

				PATTERSON
			(waving)
		Morning, friend, glorious day.

				ABDULLAH
		As are they all.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. He takes a step inside the passenger car.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. Hoping.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Reluctantly returning. He has a large box.

				BEAUMONT
		I do need to see Starling.

				PATTERSON
			(dully)
		Starling?

				BEAUMONT
		Awhile back he ordered some bibles-
			(indicating the box)
		-I've brought them.
			(looking around)
		Is he here?

				PATTERSON
			(beat)
		Yes he is.

				BEAUMONT
		Well, I need to speak to him.

				SAMUEL
			(helpfully)
		Let me deliver the bibles.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. His eyes flick from one man to the other. It's over.

				BEAUMONT
		Excellent show.
			(voice low)
		Where is Starling?

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The jig is up. He gestures-

				PATTERSON
		Here he comes now.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

HALF A DOZEN NATIVES CARRYING STARLING'S COFFIN. They start to put 
it on the train and as they do-

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Stunned. And furious! He storms off the train and we-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE

as Beaumont sees it. Patterson and Samuel are with him.

Little more work has been done than the last time we saw it. A few 
men are working slowly.

And now there are guards with rifles patrolling it.

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. A deadly look at them. He storms off.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Beaumont sees it- Patterson, Samuel, and Hawthorne stand 
quietly.

It's much more crowded than the last time. Still under control, 
but barely.

Beaumont is icy now. He gestures sharply toward Hawthrone to join 
them.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL

THE FOUR MEN speak low and fast-

				BEAUMONT
		What in hell is going on?

				SAMUEL
		The Ghost and The Darkness have come.

				BEAUMONT
			(snapping)
		In English.

				PATTERSON
		It's what the natives are calling 
		the lions-
			(beat)
		-two lions have been causing trouble-

				BEAUMONT
		-what's the surprise in that, this is
		Africa?

				PATTERSON
		It hasn't been that simple so far.

				BEAUMONT
		What have they done besides kill
		Starling?
			(beat)
		How many have they killed?
			(Patterson nods for
			Hawthorne to answer)

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Doing his best.

				HAWTHORNE
		Well, of course, I can't supply a
		totally accurate answer because
		there are those that are actually
		authenticated and there are those
		that we once thought were workers
		killing each other or deserting
		from camp so any number I give is
		subject to error-

				BEAUMONT
			(cutting through)
		How many?

				HAWTHORNE
		Thirty, I should think.

				BEAUMONT
			(stunned)
		Christ!
			(whirling on Patterson)
		What are you doing about it?
			(Now from there-)

CUT TO

SOMETHING VERY ODD:

We are looking at a small railroad car in a deserted area. This is 
not near the track but off by itself, in an area surrounded by 
thorn trees.

Several workers are erecting a cloth tent to cover it, trying to 
disguise the fact that the small railroad car is, indeed, nothing 
but a small railroad car.

It is difficult work and they are perspiring heavily.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND BEAUMONT looking at it.

				BEAUMONT
		This is supposed to be salvation?
			(staring at Patterson)
		What kind of idiocy are we dealing
		with here?

				PATTERSON
			(keeping control)
		I'm calling it my "contraption"-
		we're going to surround it with a
		boma- a fence, to you- and we're
		going to leave a small opening
		opposite that door.

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR. There is, in fact, an open front door. Patterson 
gestures for Beaumont to follow him inside.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAR AS THEY ENTER. It has been divided in half by thick 
metal bars from floor to ceiling. The bars are close together, 
only a few inches between them.

				PATTERSON
		In that half will be bait- human
		bait- I'll start things off-
			(points to the open
			doorway)
		-a sliding door will fit above that
		and a trip wire will run across
		the floor.

				BEAUMONT
			(The smile is back)
		Genius- the beast will enter,
		tripping the wire, the door will
		slide down, trapping him, you, safe
		behind the bars, will have him at
		your mercy and will shoot him.

Patterson nods. Beaumont explodes.

				BEAUMONT
		Are you running a high fever, man?
		How could you expect something as
		lunatic as this to succeed? How
		could you even conceive of it?

				PATTERSON
		I didn't conceive of it for the
		lions- I built one in India when
		there was trouble with a tiger.

				BEAUMONT
			(incredulous)
		And it worked?

				PATTERSON
			(He hates to say this)
		In point of fact, it didn't.
			(hurrying on)
		But I'm convinced the theory is
		sound.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM. They move outside. The tension between them is 
considerable. Beaumont looks at Patterson for too long a moment.

				PATTERSON
		What?

				BEAUMONT
		I made a mistake hiring you- 
		you're simply not up to the job.
			(Silence. Then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP.

				PATTERSON
		You genuinely enjoy trying to	
		terrify people, don't you? Well, 
		fine-
			(lashing back)
		-except there isn't a higher rated
		engineer and we both know that. And
		since time is so important to you,
		how long do you think it would take 
		to find someone else qualified and 
		bring him here?

CUT TO

BEAUMONT. Blazing.

				BEAUMONT
		Let me explain about time- you've 
		been here three months and already 
		two months behind. And the Germans 
		and the French are gearing up. And 
		I don't care about you and I don't 
		care about the thirty dead- I care 
		about my knighthood and if this 
		railroad finishes on schedule, I'll 
		get my knighthood and I want it.
			(glancing around as
			Samuel appears, goes to
			the workers)
		Professional hunters may be the answer.

				PATTERSON
		All they'll bring is more chaos and
		we've plenty of that already- and if
		they come in, word will get out- and
		what happens to your knighthood then?

				BEAUMONT
		I'm going to try and locate Redbeard-
		I assume you've heard of him.

				PATTERSON
		Every man who's ever fired a rifle has 
		heard of him- by the time you find him,
		the lions will be dead.

				BEAUMONT
			(long pause)
		Very well, the job's still yours, I'll 
		go. But if I have to return, you're
		finished. And I will then do everything
		I can to destroy your reputation. Am I
		not fair?
			(The great smile flashes)
		Told you you'd hate me.
			(And he turns, walks off)

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Moving up to Patterson. Samuel has a bag.

				PATTERSON
			(staring after Beaumont)
		I do hate him.
			(takes the bag from
			Samuel, pulls out flares)
		I want you to distribute one bag of
		flares to every tent area-
			(takes out a flare)
		-tell the men to light them if
		there's trouble-
			(beat)
		-make it two bags.
			(HOLD briefly, then-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. ALONE. THAT NIGHT. IN HIS CONTRAPTION.

A lamp burns alongside him. Across the bars, the door of the 
railroad car is open. Flickering shadows. Above the doorway is a 
thick wooden slab the size of the door. n the ground, barely 
visible, the trip wire.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. Outside, something is moving.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rifle ready, holding his breath.

CUT TO

THE DOORWAY. SIlence. Nothing moves now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He rubs his eyes with his hands...

CUT TO

FLICKERING SHADOWS on the wall. It's later that night.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The man is bleary with fatigue. He sits in a corner of 
the car, writing a letter.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		"Dearest...
		...peace and tranquility continue to
		abound here- the workers report each
		day with a smile- except for your
		absence, this whole adventunre is
		providing me nothing but pleasure..."

CUT TO

THE FLICKERING WALLS OF THE RAILWAY CAR. It's later still. 
Patterson, finished writing, stares out at the night.

CUT TO

A FLARE, rising brightly toward the sky.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, seeing the flare. The man is miserable.

CUT TO

A TREE BRANCH. MANY FLOWERS AS WELL AS THE CLAW THORNS.

				PATTERSON'S VOICE (over)
		Fire.

The branch is destroyed, the flowers blown away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THREE INDIAN COOLIES. NOT FAR FROM HIS CONTRAPTION.

THE COOLIES hold rifles. They look like brothers, which they are. 
They also look tough. And they are that, too. THREE 
STREETFIGHTERS.

				PATTERSON
			(impressed)
		Very good indeed.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
			(he wears glasses)
		We have hunted since childhood.

				PATTERSON
		All right- you'll spend your nights
		inside.
			(He indicates the railroad
			car. The Coolies nod)
		You'll have plenty of ammunition.
		You're totally protected, you have
		really nothing to fear.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		That is correct.
			(beat)
		Nothing.

Patterson looks at the three men. Obviously, he could not have 
chosen better. From them-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. DAY.

A lot of men working under Patterson. Progress is slow.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. NIGHT.

Some men sit on the part that's been built. Spending the night 
there for protection. Now, they all turn and we

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE going off in another part of camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in a tree alone, in despair.

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES IN THE RAILROAD CAR.

Tough as ever. Ready for anything. But nothing is happening. 
Silence.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE AGAIN AS NIGHT FALLS - MORE CROWDED THAN BEFORE.

STILL MORE MEN are moving into the river. They wade til the water 
is up to their necks. Then they reach out, hold hands, start to 
sing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON moving high into a tree. He listens to the sound. 
Lovely.

CUT TO

MOONLIGHT ON THE WATER. The men stand as before, singing softly. 
The river here is calm, no current to speak of. The men are safe-

-or rather they should be.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS swimming softly, his great jaws silently encircling 
the neck of the last man in line, pulling him silently away and as 
the others start to scream-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching another flare rise, helplessly listening.

CUT TO

A CATTLE PEN. THE CATTLE ARE NERVOUS-

-one of them kicks wildly at the wind.

They should be nervous-

-The Ghost walks among them, chooses which one to kill, leaps on 
it, brings it to earth as the dust rises.

CUT TO

ANOTHER FLARE IN THE NIGHT.

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL. DAY. PACKED.

HAWTHORNE seems overwhelmed.

CUT TO

SOMETHING.

And for a moment we don't know what it is. There is a faint light 
and now we see what it is we're looking at: a wire.

HOLD ON THE WIRE.

And now a paw walks across it-

-and the instant that happens-

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, the brothers, in the contraption, two of them 
asleep, a flickering lamp the only illumination in the railroad 
car and

CUT TO

THE DOOR OF THE RAILROAD CAR slamming loudly down and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE DARKNESS, standing alone in one half of the railroad car- it's 
incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked 
and

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

The entire of the car- the thick bars separating the two halves. 
In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough 
coolies.

For a moment, it could be a frozen tableau- both sides are too 
startled and surprised to do anything but stare-

-and then all hell just explodes as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and this incredible roar comes from his throat, the 
kind of roar that can be heard five miles away in the night but 
this one in the enclosed room sounds even louder and more 
terrifying and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, throwing his huge body at the bars and

CUT TO

THE BARS and both his front claws are slashing through and

CUT TO

THE THREE TOUGH COOLIES and they retreat against the rear wall of 
the car.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, rage building, throwing its body at the bars again 
and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, pressed in fear against the far wall, unable to do 
anything but stare and

CUT TO

THE CLAWS, ripping at the air and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping forward, smashing into the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING WHERE THE BARS are connected and the sheer power of 
his leap has made them jiggle just the least bit and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, staring up at the ceiling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, AND HERE HE COMES AGAIN, roaring and his body hits 
the bars and

CUT TO

THE CEILING- and the bars shake-

-but they're not giving way.

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, as they begin to realize this and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, clawing for them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, raging and roaring on his side of the bars and

CUT TO

THE FIRST COOLIE, raising his gun and

CUT TO

THE SECOND COOLIE, his gun raised too and

CUT TO

THE THIRD COOLIE and he's ready and

CUT TO

ALL THREE AS THEY FIRE-

-and reload-

-and fire again, and reload, and-

CUT TO

THE RAILROAD CAR- and suddenly the lamp is knocked over-

-and a fire starts, flames grow and it's starting to look like 
hell in there-

-only it gets worse as we-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS at the bars-

-and suddenly it stands up- it seems to fill the car, towering 
over everything, it's like a nightmare come to kill you-

CUT TO

THE COOLIES staring up at this giant thing, and of course they're 
more terrified now than they've ever been in their lives- but 
these are tough men and they ignore the flames, ignore the 
deafening roars of the beast and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, standing there, going crazy on his side of the bars, 
trying to knock them down but they're holding and

CUT TO

THE TOUGH COOLIES, reloading and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, racing around the enclosed area now and he's trapped 
and the flames make him seem like something unalive and his eyes 
have never been so bright, his roars as deafening and

CUT TO

THE THREE COOLIES, firing again and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping at the bars again, and they shake, sure they 
shake, but they keep on holding and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES, firing, reloading, firing, reloading and as they do, 
something's starting to come clear-

-amazing as it may seem, impossible as it may be to conceive, 
they're missing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling on his side, roaring and leaping and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES and sure they fire, but they're still so goddam scared 
and

CUT TO

THE DOOR THAT SLID DOWN- it's held in place by some thick wooden 
bars-

-and now the Coolies start to hit something- the wooden bars 
because they begin to splinter and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, whirling, leaping at the bars and

CUT TO

THE COOLIES firing and then-

CUT TO

THE DOOR as it flops open and just like that-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Out the door and gone. HOLD.

CUT TO

PATTERSON JUST AFTER DAWN IN THE DAMAGED RAILROAD CAR.

Patterson stands where The Darkness was. The three Coolies are 
where they spent the night, on the other side of the bars.

This was the lowest point yet for Patterson. Not only had his 
notion come so close to working, he could never fully comprehend 
how the coolies missed. It never seemed possible- but of course, 
it really happened.

				PATTERSON
		Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-I would never make excuses- but a
		fire broke out- the light was bad- he
		kept moving-

				PATTERSON
		-well, of course he kept moving- but
		he couldn't have been more than ten
		feet away from the three of you- surely
		you must have wounded the thing-

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		I assure you we came close many times-

Abdullah is in the doorway near Patterson now- with several dozen 
men. And from Abdullah's face, this is clearly going to be a 
confrontation.

				MIDDLE COOLIE
		-the next time we will do better.
			(Patterson makes no
			reaction; moves outside)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, simmering, moving straight to Patterson as soon as he's 
out.

				ABDULLAH
		The next time will be as this time-
		The Devil has come to Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
			(not in a mood for this)
		-that's ridiculous talk and you can't
		seriously believe it-

				ABDULLAH
			(moving in- tension rising
			as others crowd behind him)
		-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I
		don't think so-

CUT TO

THE BUSH just beyond- something is moving- an animal?- Impossible 
to say.

				PATTERSON
		I wasn't and you know it and don't
		push it- just listen- we have a
		problem in Tsavo-

				ABDULLAH
			(cutting in)
		-at last you're right- we do- you are
		the problem in Tsavo-

				PATTERSON
		-careful, Abdullah-

Patterson and Abdullah and suddenly it's dangerous.

				ABDULLAH
		You do not tell me "careful"- you do
		not tell me anything- you listen
		while I talk-
			(Now suddenly a shadow
			seems to cross-)

CUT TO

ABDULLAH. CLOSE UP. His eyes widen.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

AN ENORMOUS PISTOL. Pressed hard against Abdullah's temple.

				MAN'S VOICE (over)
		-change in plan- you listen while
		I talk- because you have a question
		that needs answering.
			(beat)
		Will I pull the trigger?

PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL

REDBEARD.

We are looking at one of those legends- ageless and powerful, with 
a tanned face and a thick grey beard. He has seen everything and 
is capable of anything.

Just now he seems more than capable of killing Abdullah. Very 
calmly, he cocks the pistol.

				SAMUEL (over)
		It's Redbeard, Abdullah- he'll kill
		you.

				REDBEARD
			(not looking around)
		No hints, Samuel.

				ABDULLAH
			(The name has registered)
		You don't know all that has happened
		here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.

				REDBEARD
		You're right. The Devil has come. Look
		at me. I am the Devil.

CUT TO

ABDULLAH, staring at Redbeard. Right now Redbeard just could be.

				ABDULLAH
			(louder)
		I am a man of peace.

				REDBEARD
		Am I to take it you want to live?

				ABDULLAH
		Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

				REDBEARD
		Excellent decision.
			(Now he suddenly reaches
			out, shakes Abdullah's hand)
		Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll
		meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid
		morning.

				ABDULLAH
			(dazed- leaving)
		I think it's been a pleasure.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, and now he does another surprising thing: embraces 
Samuel.

				REDBEARD
			(three words)
		You got old.
			(Now he releases Samuel,
			turns to Patterson)
		I'm sure you're John Patterson.
			(before Patterson can reply)
		Stay out of my way.
			(And without another word,
			he's gone)

CUT TO

THE HOSPITAL

as Redbeard moves through, taking it all in. It's even worse than 
when we last saw it- bodies crammed everywhere and always the 
sound of pain and sickness.

Patterson stands in the doorway, watching, waiting.

				PATTERSON
			(as Redbeard approaches)
		I didn't have a chance to thank you.

				REDBEARD
			(preoccupied)
		What did I do?

				PATTERSON
		Got me out of trouble.

				REDBEARD
			(matter of fact)
		Nonsense- Samuel would have done
		something.
			(starts to move on)

				PATTERSON
		We need to talk.

				REDBEARD
		Let me save time- (1) you are the
		engineer; (2) you are in charge;
		(3) you're sorry I'm here. Right
		so far?
			(Patterson nods)
		Good- because (1) I am not an
		engineer, (2) I don't want to be
		in charge, and (3) I'm sorrier than
		you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo.
		So I will help you by killing the
		lions and leaving, and you will help
		me by doing what I tell you so I
		can leave. See any problems?

				PATTERSON
		Actually, no.

				REDBEARD
		All right- let's go into battle.
			(suddenly taking
			Patterson's hand)
		I'm Redbeard.
			(as they shake)

				PATTERSON
		Somehow I guessed.
			(As they move outside-)

CUT TO

THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

A BUNCH OF MEN WAIT. Hwathorne, Samuel, Abdullah, and perhaps a 
dozen other worker leaders. Redbeard and Patterson move to them.

				REDBEARD
		Starting now, we attack them.

				ABDULLAH
		How; we don't know where they are?

				REDBEARD
		We'll have to make them come to us,
		won't we? And since there are two of
		them, we're going to set two plans
		in motion.
			(to Hawthorne)
		First: we must move the entire
		hospital by tomorrow night.

				HAWTHORNE
			(appalled)
		That's a terrible idea-

				REDBEARD
			(backtracking)
		-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of
		course, you're the doctor, you 
		should know.

				HAWTHORNE
		Silliest thing I ever heard of- why
		in the world should we go through
		all that?

				REDBEARD
			(charming now)
		I suppose I could answer you. I
		suppose I could explain that the 
		place is so inviting, what with the 
		smell of blood and flesh, that they 
		have to strike. It's even possible 
		that I tell you I found some fresh 
		paw marks around back which means 
		they're already contemplating 
		feasting here.
			(Turning on Hawthorne
			now- his voice building)
		But I don't want to answer you 
		because when you question me you are 
		really saying that I don't have the 
		least idea what I am doing, that I am 
		nothing but an incompetent, that I am 
		a fool.
			(big)
		Anyone who finds me a fool, please 
		say so now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(The words burst out)
		I have been desperate for Patterson 
		to let me move the hospital since the 
		day he arrived.

				REDBEARD
			(nice smile)
		Then we agree.
			(And on that-)

BEGIN THE BUILDING SEQUENCE.

It was a huge effort and they got half of it done that day- but 
there was always the sense of impending bloodshed.

What we see first are Patterson and a bunch of shots of a lot of 
workers- laying out the dimensions of the new boma that would 
surround the place. This was to be by far the biggest wall fence 
they had in Tsavo.

And now here comes Abdullah leading a crowd of men, wading into a 
huge patch of thorn trees, cutting the thick branches down, 
starting to load them for carrying-

-and it's high noon now, and Patterson drenched with sweat, leads 
the start of the actual building- taking the thorn branches, 
bunching them together, forcing them so there is no room between 
them-

-and we can just begin to get the sense of what the fence will be- 
except at the moment it's barely a foot high-

-and now Redbeard appears, beckons to Patterson, and

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A FLAT GRASSY PLAIN. AFTERNOON NOW.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel walk quickly.

CUT TO

SAMUEL turning to Redbeard and Patterson.

				SAMUEL
		Soon.
			(Redbeard nods)

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		I have to ask- why do you need me?

				REDBEARD
		I don't really. But understand
		something- even though it may take
		me two or three days to sort this
		out-
			(Patterson has to smile
			at the phrase)
		-when I'm gone, you'll still have
		to build the bridge. And I don't
		want the men to have lost respect
		for you.

				PATTERSON
			(kind of surprised)
		That's very considerate.

				REDBEARD
		I'm always considerate- my mother
		taught me that.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, who just breaks out laughing.

				REDBEARD
		Why do you laugh?- you don't
		believe she taught me?

				SAMUEL
		I don't believe you had a mother.
			(And as Redbeard
			laughs too-)

CUT TO

A MASAI VILLAGE as they approach. Redbeard walks ahead.

				PATTERSON
		You like him, don't you?

				SAMUEL
		Oh yes. But it takes time.

				PATTERSON
		You've known him long?

				SAMUEL
			(He has)
		Since his beard was red.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE VILLAGE. AN AGED CHIEF RUNS THINGS.

Redbeard, Patterson and Samuel stand near him. WOMEN and CHILDREN 
are there. Some of the children look at Redbeard, mime shooting, 
fall down dead. Samuel translates as necessary.

				SAMUEL
		How many cattle?

				REDBEARD
		Four should do it.

				SAMUEL
		They will want a lot of money.

				PATTERSON
			(to Redbeard)
		Have you got it?

				REDBEARD
		No, but you do-
			(beat)
		-see, you were needed after all.
			(to Samuel)
		And fifty warriors at the camp
		before dawn.

				SAMUEL
			(Samuel explains. The
			Masai Chief replies.
			Translating)
		Why so many?

				REDBEARD
		Because I have two plans to kill
		the lions- one involving the cattle,
		the other the men.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON watching as Samuel tells the Chief.

CUT TO

THE MASAI CHIEF. He moves toward Redbeard and Patterson. As he 
speaks, Samuel translates quietly. There is a sadness in the 
Chief's tone.

				SAMUEL
			(translating)
		The Ghost and the Darkness have
		come... and we can do nothing...
		but if you anger them... they will
		stay in Tsavo... and life will
		become more unberable, that I know...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, watching as Redbeard replies.

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Two lions are all that have come...
		they're only lions, that I know.
			(beat)
		And I will kill them both tomorrow.
			(HOLD BRIEFLY, then-)

CUT TO

SHADOWS AND FIRELIGHT. IT'S NIGHT NOW.

We're not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic 
sounds.

Now we hear voices.

				REDBEARD VOICE (over)
		I'll need you by me in the morning.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Whatever you wish.

CUT TO

WHERE WE ARE- IT'S PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. Patterson, Redbeard, 
Hawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire.

THey are cleaning their guns, getting ready.

A WORD ABOUT THEIR WEAPONS. Patterson's is a good rifle and he 
cleans it expertly.

Redbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move 
as he assembles it, he might be bathing a child.

Hawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is 
clearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing 
power.

There is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel 
show it. Redbeard is as before.

				HAWTHORNE
			(terribly tense)
		You're certain about tomorrow?
			(Redbeard is)
		But you don't seem excited.
			(Redbeard isn't)

				PATTERSON
		You don't enjoy killing, do you?
			(Redbeard doesn't)

				HAWTHORNE
		Then why do it?

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. He stares at the fire. Then-

				REDBEARD
		I have a gift.

CUT TO

THE CAMPFIRE. Silence for a moment except for the sound of the 
weapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back 
together. He stands, nods, goes.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, watching him.

				HAWTHORNE
		Strange man.
			(to Samuel)
		Has he always been this way?

				SAMUEL
		Much gentler now.

				HAWTHORNE
			(shakes his head on that)
		John?-
			(He holds out his
			beautiful rifle)
		Change guns with me- mine's much
		more powerful. I'll be finishing
		the hospital tomorrow so I won't
		be with you- but if you'll use
		this...
			(beat)
		...then I will.

Patterson, touched, changes weapons.

				PATTERSON
		Thank you.
			(He turns to Samuel)
		Why does he need you by him?

				SAMUEL
		He doesn't. He needs nobody. But
		we have hunted many times...
			(beat)
		...he knows I am afraid of lions...

HOLD ON THE FIRELIGHT UNTIL WE SHARPLY-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE. BEFORE DAWN.

Misty- hard to see much.

Then GHOSTS appear-

KEEP HOLDING

-they're not ghosts, they're MASAI WARRIORS emerging from the 
mists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking 
equipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them 
materialize-

CUT TO

A HUGE THICKET.

Redbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach.

				REDBEARD
			(whispered)
		I spotted one of them-
			(gesturing toward
			the thicket)
		-in there.

CUT TO

THE THICKET again- alive with thorn trees. Dark, filled with long 
dark shadows.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. A lot of tension.

				REDBEARD
		The best way to ensure the kill
		when you're using trackers is for
		one to shoot while the other uses
		the trackers to force the lion
		toward the shooter. Have you ever
		led trackers?

				PATTERSON
			(He hasn't)
		I can try.

				REDBEARD
			(no good)
		Samuel says you killed a lion.

				PATTERSON
		It was probably luck- I'd rather
		you did the shooting.

				REDBEARD
		You'd never force the lion to me-
		and nobody ever got a lion with
		one shot by luck.
			(points- hand out
			straight)
		Around there's a clearing- you'll
		know it from the anthills- get
		there and hide and listen to the
		sounds- I'll make the lion come
		directly to you.
			(He gestures for
			Patterson to take
			off and as he does-)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS as Redbeard goes to them-

				REDBEARD
			(as Samuel translates)
		-all of you- spread the width of
		the clearing- no gaps- go-
			(claps his hands once)

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spreading apart.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like hell.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently.

CUT TO

A THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ducking his head, blasting through.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, starting to cover the entire width of the thicket.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, quickstepping over rocky terrain.

CUT TO

SAMUEL staying close to Redbeard. The fear is there.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, studying the position of the Warriors, who are almost 
ready.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, circling now, racing toward a clearing, picking up 
speed.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, spread out. They look to Redbeard.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Not yet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, racing into the clearing, glances around- lots of 
anthills.

CUT TO

AN ANTHILL, eight feet high. It casts a long shadow.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Holding Hawthorne's marvelous rifle, he slips silently 
into the shadow.

HOLD ON PATTERSON- it's almost as if he weren't there.

CUT SHARPLY TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Suddenly screaming and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, screaming too and

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, suddenly moving forward, all of them 
shouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the shadow. The noise is faint- but he can hear it.

CUT TO

A DOZEN DRUMMERS, moving forward, banging away.

CUT TO

A DOZEN MORE DRUMMERS, even louder.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving forward, his eyes flicking ahead-

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Just the least bit louder now.

CUT TO

THE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, screaming and pounding and

CUT TO

SAMUEL- the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. His eyes flicking ahead.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. It's a lot louder now. He's totally still. And he's 
ready.

CUT TO

THE DENSEST PART OF THE THICKET we've seen yet.

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, slashing their way through, drumming and shouting 
and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, at their head, eyes, as always, flicking.

CUT TO

THE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.

CUT TO

REDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point-

-because something is there-

CUT BACK TO

THE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw 
it before-

-but now something begins to move and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and 
they're starting to move faster and

CUT TO

PATTERSON IN THE SHADOW.

The noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more 
distinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we

CUT TO

A FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to 
move away from the sound-

-and toward where Patterson is waiting.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and

CUT TO

SAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON- he fingers the weapon.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now 
instead of going straight back it begins to veer left and

CUT TO

REDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors 
to get left and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The 
Ghost's intended path and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift 
the other way and

CUT TO

THE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's 
path again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in 
the original direction- toward Patterson and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass 
hysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and 
sure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but 
you couldn't tell that from what they're doing-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware 
of Patterson's existence behind him.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the 
sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, backing toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to turn.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, ready to fire.

CUT TO

THE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And 
now its lips go back as it sees Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he 
squeezes the trigger-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull 
snap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired.

CUT TO

THE GHOST, unharmed and

CUT TO

PATTERSON desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function 
and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. It stares at Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE GHOST-

-and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau-

-THEN THE GHOST ROARS-

CUT TO

REDBEARD as he hears it, breaking into a wild run-

				REDBEARD
		Shoot for chrissakes!-

CUT TO

PATTERSON standing his ground as now THE GHOST takes a step toward 
him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the 
clearing and as he reaches it-

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and

CUT TO

REDBEARD's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot 
at the animal- he curses, races for a better position and

CUT TO

THE GHOST. One final stare at Patterson-

-then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket-

-and it's safe and free and gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Rocked.

The low point of his life.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, catching up to Redbeard.

				SAMUEL
		Did you ever see a lion that size?

				REDBEARD
		Not even close.
			(Now he moves to
			Patterson)
		What happened?

				PATTERSON
			(a whisper)
		...misfire... it jammed...

				REDBEARD
		Has it ever done that before?

				PATTERSON
		...don't know...

				SAMUEL
		It's Hawthorne's.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Trying for control.

				REDBEARD
		You exchanged weapons?
			(Patterson nods)
		You went into battle with an
		untried gun?
			(Patterson nods)

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's 
going to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to 
happen.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet.

CUT TO

REEDBEARD, studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, 
his voice is surprisingly quiet.

				REDBEARD
		They have an expression in
		prizefighting: "everyone has a plan
		until they're hit."
			(beat)
		You've just been hit...
			(beat)
		...the getting up is up to you...
			(And he turns, moves
			off and)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL.

Nearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is 
supervising men and material that are being transferred.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to 
the center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the 
outskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the 
sick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now.

Patterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are TWO 
EXPERIENCED ORDERLIES, both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson 
is silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his 
face.

				REDBEARD
			(to the Orderlies)
		Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell
		at all here, and little blood. When
		we leave, close the gate securely,
		don't open it til morning and keep
		your fires high. Any questions, ask
		them now.
			(They understand- now
			to Samuel and Hawthorne)
		You two will sleep beautifully in
		your tents.
			(beat)
		And stay there.

				SAMUEL
		And where will you sleep beautifully?

				REDBEARD
			(smile)
		Patterson and I will be in the old
		hospital- where the enticing smell
		of sickness still lingers-
			(beat)
		-and by the time we're done, I
		promise you, the odor of blood will
		be irresistible.
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. STARTING TO GET DARK.

Redbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the 
inside perimeter-

-buckets of blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Darker. They empty still more full buckets 
of blood. Redbeard seems pleased.

CUT TO

SAMUEL AND HAWTHORNE, hurrying toward their camp.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of 
the Old Hospital.

CUT TO

THE ORDERLIES IN THE NEW HOSPITAL, firmly closing and locking the 
gate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, just outside the fence of the Old 
Hospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as 
they move.

CUT TO

THE SUN. Dying... dying...

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They slip inside the deserted Old 
Hospital, pull the gate securely shut.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE. They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling 
to each other.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are 
already asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL. Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their 
fire, waiting. The cows are quiet.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they 
drink tea.

CUT TO

THE MOON. Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Walking the fence perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The cows are edgy. He calms the cows.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE THE OLD HOSPITAL. The large chunks of meat are visible in 
the moonlight.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The orderlies are calm.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, still walking the perimeter.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard 
moves to him, speaks in a whisper.

				REDBEARD
		Think about something else.

				PATTERSON
		Have you ever failed?

				REDBEARD
			(sad smile)
		Only in life...
			(He walks away.
			Patterson watches.)

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly.

CUT TO

THE NIGHT AND THE MOON. Lovely.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly 
quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from 
Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the 
ripping of flesh-

CAMERA MOVES UP

Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in 
shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.

Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for 
Patterson to switch positions with him.

As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops.

Silence again.

Patterson reaches the far side of the fence.

Now the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are 
outside, directly across from Patterson.

CUT TO

REDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going 
on, it's sure as hell odd.

CUT TO

THE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out 
violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just 
before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one-

-now a different sound is heard: scratching-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound-

-the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the 
ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their 
buckets.

CUT TO

THE GATE. More pressure against it- it could give way any moment.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON and from the look on Redbeard's face, this 
is it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we-

CUT TO

THE CATTLE, going nuts and then-

CUT TO

THE GATE. All pressure gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Patterson is furious.

				PATTERSON
		Goddammit!

				REDBEARD
		It's all right. Stay ready.
			(indicates the blood)
		They know it's there.

Patterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon.

CUT TO

REDBEARD; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption.

				REDBEARD
			(going to him)
		Meant to ask you- the railroad car
		trap. Your idea?
			(Patterson nods)
		Excellent notion- I used the same
		device myself once.

				PATTERSON
		But of course yours worked.

				REDBEARD
		In point of fact it didn't- but I'm
		convinced the idea is sound.

He goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and 
for the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to 
lift.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL

and an ORDERLY, blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the 
fire and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before 
he can scream-

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS suddenly beside him, and their giant 
paws slap out so fast we can't follow and

CUT TO

THE SECOND ORDERLY, dropping to the ground, and now we're starting 
to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning.

CUT TO

A TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and

CUT TO

A PAW flashing and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and

CUT TO

A SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed 
face and

CUT TO

TWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, leaping on them and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and

CUT TO

A SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream-

-the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry 
we've heard and

CUT TO

THE ENTIRE CAMP, NIGHT, WITH ALL THE FIRES BURNING- AND 
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA IS CLOSE BY-

-but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it 
and he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel 
does his best to stop him-

-but Hawthorne rips free and we

CUT TO

A SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and

CUT TO

THE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and

CUT TO

MEDICINE, flying across the tent and

CUT TO

GLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and

CUT TO

A BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those 
terrible bright blazing eyes and

CUT TO

A TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: 
destroying the New Hospital and

CUT TO

MORE TENTS collapsing and

CUT TO

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.

CUT TO

SHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we

CUT TO

THE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring 
around-

CUT TO

THE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone-

-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New 
Hospital and the instant they are heard

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open 
and they're off as we

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night.

CUT TO

THE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) 
The tents are all down. The place is devastated.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on.

CUT TO

PAN ALONG THE TENT

Dead. Blood. Pain.

PAN TO THE SECOND TENT

More dead.

More dying.

It's a slaughterhouse.

CUT TO

HAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his 
last.

THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at 
each other-

-then they slow.

Because the New Hospital has come into view.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, CLOSE UP, staring at the disaster.

And this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's 
going to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands 
there. Just stands there. Unable to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos.

He stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere. 
Hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone.

All that's left now is this: the sound of pain.

HOLD.

Dust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains.

Now different sounds take over-

-an incredible babble of human voices.

AND A RAILROAD TRAIN.

Patterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his 
face, is a few steps behind.

We are at the STATION AREA and it is jammed. A train has pulled 
into the station-

-only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are 
workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber 
up onto the roofs of the cars-

-covering the cars-

-everyone is leaving-

-Patterson can only watch.

Abdullah stands on one of the cars-

-the train begins to pull out of the station.

More and more workers chase after it, get pulled on.

Now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full.

Patterson still watches, eyes vacant.

Abdullah sees him, looks away.

The train gathers speed.

Rounds a corner...

...gone...

Patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close 
behind him, the worried look still there.

CUT TO

THE OLD HOSPITAL.

A FEW AFRICAN ORDERLIES do the best they can. Patterson watches 
only a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him.

CUT TO

THE CAMP as Patterson walks through. A ghost town now. Only 
Africans remain.

CUT TO

THE CONTRAPTION where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on.

CUT TO

THE ANTHILL IN THE CLEARING where Patterson misfired. Patterson 
looks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his 
tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.

IT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.

Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he 
never takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE.

It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a 
lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. 
Desolate.

Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as 
he did the night before.

Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, 
wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.

For a moment, neither says a word. Then-

				REDBEARD
			(out of the blue)
		It would have been a beautiful 
		bridge, John. I never noticed 
		before, occupied with other 
		business, I	suppose...
			(He's rambling)
		...never really pay much attention
		to that kind of thing but I've had
		the time today, nothing else on,
		and this... it's graceful and the
		placement couldn't be prettier...
		and...
			(He goes silent now,
			stares off)

				PATTERSON
		You just got hit.
			(Redbeard nods)
		The getting up is up to you- but
		they're only lions-
			(beat)
		-and I'm going after them crack
		of dawn...
			(And on that-)

CUT TO

A LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-

-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet 
tall- gorgeous early morning light.

As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the 
cliff.

As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.

THE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the 
rock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of 
course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. 
They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM as they make it over the cliff face. They stand, 
stare out.

CUT TO

WHAT THEY SEE: the world. They move on.

CUT TO

A RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if 
you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on 
their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard 
starts to speak. They don't stop moving.

				REDBEARD
		In my town, when I was little,
		there was a brute, a bully who
		terrorized the place.
			(beat)
		But he was not the problem. He
		had a brother who was worse than
		he. But the brother was not the
		problem.
			(beat)
		One or the other of them was
		usually in jail. The problem came
		when they were both free togther.
		The two became different from
		either alone.
			(beat)
		Alone they were only brutes.
		Together they became lethal,
		together they killed.

				PATTERSON
		What happened to them?

				REDBEARD
			(pause)
		I got big.
			(They move on)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's 
hard going. They help each other.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. 
Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points-

CUT TO

A TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: 
there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used 
it as a regular passage.

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a 
word move through it.

CUT TO

THE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: 
a cave.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Dark.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward 
it.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him.

CUT TO

THE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside.

CUT TO

WHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low 
tunnel you have to half-crawl through.

Without a word, they start inside.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. 
Ahead there is light. They move on.

CUT TO

THE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond.

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just 
a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear.

Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up.

CUT TO

INSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- 
dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's 
dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck-

				REDBEARD
		Dear God-
			(And on those words-)

CUT TO

THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more-

-and now bones-

-the floor of the place is littered with human bones-

-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones.

				PATTERSON
		Their den?
			(Redbeard nods)
		Have you ever seen anything like
		this?

				REDBEARD
		Nobody's seen anything like this.
		Lions don't have caves like this-
			(beat)
		-they're doing it for pleasure.

CUT TO

SEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave-

-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels-

-something is coming close and coming fast and

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the 
sound explodes-

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL-

-shrieks-

CUT TO

REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. What the hell is it?

CUT TO

THE TUNNEL- and here they come, screeching and angry-

-bats-

-swarms of them- hundreds of them-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, diving to the ground, lying there amidst 
the bangles and the bones and the skulls-

CUT TO

THE BATS. Circling above them. Screeching louder.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, lying very still, eyeless skulls all 
around, staring.

CUT TO

THE BATS. For a moment, it seems as if they might attack.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND REDBEARD. Waiting, waiting. Then-

CUT TO

THE BATS  back into the tunnel and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, scrambling to their feet.

				REDBEARD
		One of my chief attributes is that
		I'm always calm.

And then without warning, from behind them, a roar-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD spin around, start back toward the entrance 
of the cave-

CUT TO

THE LOW ENTRANCE TUNNEL as they scramble half-crawling through it.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE as they make it, stand straight, look around-

CUT TO

THICK BUSH beyond- another roar and sudden movement and

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, entering the thick bush- but carefully, 
because they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from 
anywhere- there is the sound of water-

-slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and 
they're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water 
sound gets stronger- and as they burst clear-

CUT TO

AN AMAZING PLACE- AN AREA OF FLAT ROCK SPLIT UP AHEAD BY A WIDE 
FAST-RUNNING WATERFALL.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They look around. Nothing is there. But 
the spot is wide open, exposed.

				PATTERSON
			(The words pour out)
		Where could it have gone? How
		could it get across the water?
			(looks at Redbeard)
		They're only lions, yes?

				REDBEARD
			(shakes his head; he
			doesn't know)
		Don't they have to be?...

They look around a moment more. Nothing to see-

-they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush. And now-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- who knows where it is but it's there-

-watching Patterson.

HOLD BRIEFLY on The Darkness, then-

CUT TO

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. JUST BEFORE DAWN-

-outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones.

Patterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. 
Patterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the 
other.

				SAMUEL
			(pointing)
		Both of them over there.

He is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard.

				PATTERSON
		Ever have to use a machan?
			(Redbeard hasn't)
		I did once. In India. We will 
		tonight.
			(Now from that-)

CUT TO

A CLEARING. LATER IN THE DAY.

Patterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd 
looking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting 
inward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air. 
Redbeard and Samuel approach.

				PATTERSON
		They're used to people in trees,
		not in a clearing.
			(indicating the plank)
		It may be tight.

				REDBEARD
		Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's
		your idea, you go up there.
			(to Samuel)
		Take the others to the water tower
		for the night.

				PATTERSON
		I'll be bait alone?

				REDBEARD
		Yes. And I'll be in some distant
		tree where I can provide no
		assistance whatsoever.
			(beat)
		Can you control your fear?

				PATTERSON
		I'll have to.

				REDBEARD
		I can't control mine- I'd be lost
		without the shame factor driving me.

				PATTERSON
		Was that supposed to make me feel
		better?
			(Redbeard doesn't
			reply. Now-)

CUT TO

A DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER.

THE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan.

Patterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support 
poles- they're rickety.

CUT TO

DUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall.

CUT TO

THE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining 
men who clamber up to the platform on top.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Redbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the 
plank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous.

CUT TO

THE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages 
to sit.

CUT TO

THE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable.

CUT TO

REDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get 
comfortable. He can't.

				REDBEARD
			(glancing around)
		It's certainly the best chance
		they've had to kill you.

				PATTERSON
		You think they'll come then?
			(Redbeard does)
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(not answering)
		Good luck.

				PATTERSON
		Why?

				REDBEARD
			(beat)
		Because I think they're after you.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to 
leave.

				PATTERSON
		How many do you think they've 
		killed?

				REDBEARD
			(reluctantly)
		The most of any lions... a 
		hundred...?
			(beat)
		Probably more.
			(Now Redbeard looks
			up at the younger man)
		Johnny...?

They study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been 
through a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when 
they first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand.

				REDBEARD
		Don't fuck up.
			(And he turns, never
			looks back, just goes)

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He is alone now.

CUT TO

SHADOWS. Growing longer.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It peers around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel-

-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, 
the world could explode.

CUT TO

THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. 
Nothing unusual.

MOVE IN CLOSER:

Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches.

CUT TO

THE SUN. About to die.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He 
stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, 
giving it color.

CUT TO

THE SUN and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just 
set, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and 
in a blink it isn't. As it drops-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. It's madness that he's up here. And he knows 
it. And that shows.

CUT TO

THE SKY. No moon. Just thick cloud.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. Quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of 
him past the donkey.

CUT TO

THE THICK BUSH BEYOND THE DONKEY. Nothing moves-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at 
the donkey.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. LATER. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DARK.

And now, just the beginning of a mist.

CUT TO

THE SKY. THICKER AND THICKER CLOUDS. LATER STILL. GETTING TOWARD 
MORNING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, 
listening for something, anything-

-but all there is is silence.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY. It lies still and quiet.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to 
scream.

CUT TO

THE BUSHES AROUND HIM. The mist is getting stronger.

CUT TO

REDBEARD in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing 
mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, listening, listening-

-and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear 
it but to Patterson it might as well be thunder-

-from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a 
twig.

CUT TO

THE DONKEY, and it's eyes widen-

HOLD ON THE DONKEY.

Because now something happens that hasn't happened before: 
suddenly there are no colors, only tones-

-because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's 
happening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of 
the lion-

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. Watching the donkey.

And from now on, when we are using PATTERSON'S POINT OF VIEW, 
everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted.

When we are using THE GHOST'S POINT OF VIEW, everything is totally 
clear- and sounds are thunderous.

CUT TO

WHAT PATTERSON SEES: just mist and vaguely, bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey. And CAMERA begins to move closer 
as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be 
some movement in the bushes.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey, very, very close-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but 
the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: THE DONKEY.

HOLD.

Now there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: 
the four legs of the platform.

HOLD.

Now we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together.

HOLD AS THE GHOST AT LAST SEES PATTERSON.

CUT TO

THE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts-

-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around 
the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He 
half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is 
behind him.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to 
change.

CUT TO

PATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about 
the donkey anymore, it's stalking him.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, 
always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know 
he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do 
anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the 
lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite 
seen.)

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to 
let the animal's position out of his sight.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer...

CUT TO

PATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come 
apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on 
turning.

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- 
that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, 
almost knocking him off the plank and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and 
he's trying not to fall and

CUT TO

WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and 
as he starts his leap-

CUT TO

REDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing 
his rifle, firing again and

CUT TO

THE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, 
lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes 
and the night has him and

CUT TO

SUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring 
at the ground-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. Blood.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again-

CUT TO

THE GROUND. More blood and...

CUT TO

THE TWO OF THEM, starting to slow-

CUT TO

STRANGE TERRAIN- huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, 
some of them fifteen feet high, some even higher.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They separate, take different paths 
through the anthills.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. Alert. One step at a time.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. The same. One step at at time.

CUT TO

THE GHOST. Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, 
staring down at them both.

CUT TO

REDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they 
might be statues.

CUT TO

THE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them 
and as he does-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, launched in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates-

CUT TO

THE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and-

-and FREEZE.

Freeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky.

HOLD. THen-

CUT TO

SAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT-

-we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment 
when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-

-only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the 
actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead 
animal to the ground-

CUT TO

THE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully, 
and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face.

CUT TO

A PHOTOGRAPHER; loads of bulky equipment. Patterson and Redbeard 
stand behind him, watching him. We're in a lovely spot by the 
river. Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking.

				BEAUMONT
		I think another for posterity-
		this is an important moment in
		my life.

He strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work.

				BEAUMONT
		Understand, I had help-

				PATTERSON
		-not a time for modesty, Bob-

				REDBEARD
		-undeniably your triumph.

				BEAUMONT
		Oh surely there's enough credit
		for us all- let's not forget, you
		did the actual shooting. Of course,
		I hired you, I was the general who
		put the team together. And generals
		are the ones who tend to be
		remembered.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		Perhaps you might put your head in
		its mouth, sir- could be a corker.

				BEAUMONT
		Clever idea, I like it.

CUT TO

THE MOUTH OF THE GHOST- it is huge-

-Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the 
enormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we

CUT TO

REDBEARD suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and

CUT TO

BEAUMONT, surprised and frightened-

-he jerks his head away-

-there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's-

-Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, 
humiliated, and as the laughter builds-

CUT TO

THE TENT AREA. NIGHT.

Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them, 
their first, no fear in the vicinity.

It should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of 
champagne.

It should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away 
from the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his 
eyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- 
he is more at ease with the world.

				PATTERSON
			(drunk)
		I never thought I'd say this, but
		I'm glad you came.

				REDBEARD
			(drunk)
		Understood- you realize now you
		could never have done it without
		me.

				PATTERSON
		Actually, I could have done it
		much more easily without you, but
		for whatever reason, I'm glad you
		came.
			(They toast each other)

Samuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins 
them.

				SAMUEL
			(drunk)
		Where do you go next?

				REDBEARD
		Some Russian princes want to hunt
		the Himalayas. You?

				SAMUEL
		Help finish the railroad.

				PATTERSON
		I want to meet my son- he must be
		what, two months old?

They look at the fire a moment. Then-

				SAMUEL
		Three years I've worked for the
		railroad. Now I don't know why. It
		seemed a good idea once.

				PATTERSON
		I feel the same about the bridge.
		This country certainly didn't ask
		for it, doesn't need it.

				REDBEARD
		Too soon to tell.

They look at him.

				REDBEARD
		My life was shaped because someone
		invented gunpowder. Our lives have
		crossed because two lions went mad.
		But what if in the future the three
		of us do something grand for
		humanity? Was that worth all the
		lives? Too soon to tell.

				SAMUEL
			(drinks)
		Some mysteries should not have 
		solutions.

				REDBEARD
			(finishes his bottle,
			rises, looks at Patterson)
		Hold your son high.
			(And he turns, goes
			to his tent)

				PATTERSON
			(beat- quietly)
		He has children?

				SAMUEL
			(beat- quietly)
		Once...
			(HOLD on the two
			in the firelight. Then-)

CUT TO

THE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE 
NEXT DAY.

				FEMALE VOICE (over)
		I'd like to see John Patterson,
		please.
			(As he looks up-)

CUT TO

HELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but 
still lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is 
adorable.

				HELENA
		Could you tell him that his wife-
			(catches herself, smiles)
		-that his family has come to see him.
			(On that-)

CUT TO

PATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- 
Patterson takes off running and

CUT TO

TSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back 
and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all 
but her heels.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station 
area.

CUT TO

HELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the 
building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly 
and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, excitedly waving back and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly screaming "Get back- back-"

CUT TO

HELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- 
she smiles again, waves again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, "GET BACK" and

CUT TO

HELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the 
same, she stops and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child.

CUT TO

HELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, starting to run and

CUT TO

PATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get 
there, he's never going to get there-

CUT TO

HELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she 
turns-

-but too late, too late as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, in agony.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as 
Helena cries out helplessly-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crying out helplessly and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON IN HIS TENT,

continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had 
is over-

-he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.

CUT TO

OUTSIDE. It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the 
dream. He looks around.

Redbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it-

CUT TO

INSIDE THE TENT. It's empty. Patterson stares around-

-there is blood on the tent floor and quickly-

CUT TO

THE SUN. RISING.

CUT TO

PATTERSON running wildly, rifle in hand and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash 
across a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, 
widening the area of search and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, veering off and

CUT TO

THORN TREES, as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the 
damage to his clothes or his skin and

CUT TO

MORE THORNS- he plunges wildly ahead and

CUT TO

A LARGE ANTHILL- it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- 
Patterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it-

-nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working 
overtime and is only getting worse-

Patterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do-

-and then SAMUEL'S VOICE on the wind- calling to him-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, 
louder-

-Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend-

CUT TO

A FIELD OF WHITE GRASS. So lovely.

With one patch in the middle that is blood red.

Something is moving in the blood red area.

Patterson has his rifle ready-

-and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen 
something beyond imagination.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to 
where Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down 
into the grass-

-clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and 
Samuel stare mute at one another-

-and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar 
of The Darkness. They don't even react.

CUT TO

FLAMES RISING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.

We should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this 
before.

START PULLING BACK.

Samuel stands there, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK.

Patterson stands there too, trying to hold it together.

KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

REDBEARD'S FUNERAL PYRE. Flames consume the body.

Just Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there.

The flames lick at the sky...

HOLD...

CUT TO

A LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING 
DARK NOW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use 
at the bridge, not far from the baboon.

				PATTERSON
		You're positive lions hate baboons?
			(Samuel is)
		Pebbles?
			(Samuel holds up a bag)
		Let's get it over with.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, 
fifteen feet from the baboon.

They help each other into position. Almost night.

CUT TO

THE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into 
the darkness.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble 
toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but 
irritation-

CUT TO

THE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S 
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries 
out.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; 
only nervous energy is keeping him going now.

CUT TO

THE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and 
frightening black clouds gather and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky 
is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to 
hallucinate.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM.

Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.

CUT TO

THE RIVER, raging and black and lethal.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hallucinating again.

CUT TO

JUST BEFORE DAWN

and The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge 
toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears-

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Firing-

CUT TO

-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and-

CUT TO

-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, 
turning back, ready to fire again-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS- gone.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around.

				PATTERSON
		Where is it?

				SAMUEL
			(pointing down)
		Underneath.
			(beat)
		Somewhere.

CUT TO

WHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes 
several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run.

They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we

CUT TO

EARLY MORNING LIGHT.

Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to 
the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson 
releases the baboon which races away.

CUT TO

WHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began 
construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away 
before them.

CUT TO

They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully...

..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, 
making sure they miss nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Ready for anything.

CUT TO

THE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing.

CUT TO

THE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their 
breaths.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. It seems empty.

CUT TO

A SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding.

CUT TO

PATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it.

CUT TO

THE SCAFFOLDING. Nothing is visible.

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND SAMUEL- Frozen. They listen-

-nothing but their breathing.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, looking around everywhere.

CUT TO

THE HOLE. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

THE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

CUT TO

SAMUEL, looking this way, that way.

SHOCK CUT TO

THE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson 
falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it 
gets up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle-

-only Samuel isn't there-

-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS ROARING AND

CUT TO

PATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the 
narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without 
slipping or falling and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it 
takes off after Patterson and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the 
nearest tree and

CUT TO

PATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a 
dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary 
speed, it's still faster than Patterson and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and

CUT TO

THE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's 
just up ahead and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, closing and

CUT TO

THE TREE, and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, springing into the air now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both 
hands, swinging his body up as we

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the 
branch and now comes this insane roar and

CUT TO

SAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree.

CUT TO

PATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen 
feet up.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's 
tree, raging with frustration.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks 
across at the next tree not far away where Samuel is-

				SAMUEL
			(embarrassed)
		Afraid of lions.

CUT TO

PATTERSON.

				PATTERSON
		It's all right, Samuel- we all
		get hit-
			(Now he shuts up 
			fast and-)

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb 
the tree after Patterson. Lions are cats and when they want to 
climb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going 
up and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, 
climbing higher and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there 
is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, going still higher but the branches are getting thinner 
and the tree is shaking, and he could fall-

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, climbing on, nothing can stop it-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS, together in the tree, and there's no 
further Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but 
slowly it moves in and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, calling out-

				PATTERSON
		Samuel!
			(And he gestures for
			the rifle and the
			instant he does-)

CUT TO

SAMUEL, and he takes the rifle between his two hands and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, steadily moving in and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less 
than fifteen feet away and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, hands out to catch it and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE in mid-air and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, both hands ready and

CUT TO

THE RIFLE as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, almost on Patterson now and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long 
way and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a 
lot of choices in this world and

CUT TO

SAMUEL, staring as Patterson falls and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg 
broken and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn 
but it does and

CUT TO

PATTERSON crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he 
reaches the weapon, grabs for it and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, skittering down the tree and as it reaches the 
ground

CUT TO

PATTERSON, forcing himself to his feet and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its 
charge.

CUT TO

PATTERSON, aims, fires and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and down it goes again but up it comes 
again and

CUT TO

PATTERSON, firing the final shot and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, hit again and it has to stop, it just has to-

-but it doesn't.

It roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson.

CUT TO

PATTERSON; all bullets gone, no place to hide.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS. Still moving forward.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a 
branch, lands hard and

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now 
four, now-

CUT TO

PATTERSON, helpless on the ground.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-

-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge 
teeth into the branch-

-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. Can't breathe.

CUT TO

THE DARKNESS, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. And suddenly he just empties and tears pour 
down his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with 
sobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal-

CUT TO

PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS. Just the sound of Patterson's tears...

HOLD.

KEEP HOLDING.

CAMERA BEGINS TO RISE-

-WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BRIDGE NOW- AND IT'S FINISHED!

-hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it-

-Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile-

-and Patterson's there, too. He stands with Helena, his young son 
in his arms.

Everybody smiles, everybody waves, the train goes triumphantly by.

CUT TO

PATTERSON. He looks wonderful again, vibrant and young. Watching 
him, you might think he hadn't been through the nightmare as he 
stands there, holding the boy tightly.

But with his other hand, he fingers the lion claw necklace...

HOLD ON PATTERSON.

Now slowly dissolve to an African evening. Animals stretch from 
one horizon to the other.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Here we still wonder about them.
		How did they escape for nine months?
		And kill 135 men? And stop the
		railroad?
			(beat)
		And were they only lions?
			(beat)
		If you want to decide for yourself,
		you must go to America. They are at
		the Field Museum in Chicago, and
		even now, after they have been dead
		a century, if you dare to lock eyes
		with them...
			(beat)
		...you will be afraid.

In the distance, the animals continue to move.

				SAMUEL VOICE (over)
		Sleep well.

HOLD ON THE ANIMALS. They seem to go on forever...

FINAL FADE OUT.


THE END

          EXT. HIGH PLAINS - HILLSIDE - DAY

          A COYOTE lopes through shimmering heat waves. The sky above
          is a cloudless blue.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          My Father used to say that the only way
          Evil came into your life was if you
          invited it. I'm not sure about that, at
          least not anymore. What I cLQ know is
          this: we are born alone, and we die
          alone, and what happens in between is all
          that matters. The choices we make, the
          people whose paths we cross -- these are
          the things that determine our fate.
          The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link fence, weaves
          through the rusted ruins of a --

          DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK
          Broken-down rides, weed-clogged machinery, sideshow trailers
          bleached bone-white.

          WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Most stories start with a beginning. His
          began with an ending. I never knew where
          he really came from. I guess it's not
          important anymore. All I know is that
          he'd been running his entire life.
          Running for so long that he no longer
          knew whether he was running away from

                         SOMETHING --
          The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks out over a patchy
          Southwestern town.

          WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          -- or towards it.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. BAD IRON BIKE REPAIR - DAY

          Sparks, noise, metal and grime. JOHN BLAZE (30s, ruggedly
          handsome) is running late. He sprints across the workshop
          floor, shedding his welder's kit as he heads for the time clock.
          CLUNK! He punches out -- but LITTLE MIKE (50s, trailer trash
          fast) has caught him in the act.

                         LITTLE MIKE
          where do you chink you're going, Blaze?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                         BLAZE
          Sick, cutting out early.

                         LITTLE MIKE
          The hell you are!
          Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered BSA.

          LITTLE MIKE (CONT'D)
          Get back to work or your ass is fired!

                         BLAZE
          Aaa n? You say that every time.
          Blaze kicks-starts the bike. It ROARS thunderously.

                         LITTLE MIKE
          (over the noise)
          Well I mean it this time!

                         BLAZE
          (gunning the throttle)
          See you tomorrow, Little Mike!
          The bike HOWLS, hauls up on its back wheel. Screams out the
          shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears. The other workers
          WHOOP and HOLLER, especially when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT-
          CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the fly.

          EXT. BAD IRON SHOP YARD/DIRT ROAD - DAY

          Blaze skids out of the yard, matching speed with a pickup
          which is just passing by. COOP is driving. JED and MURPHY
          are LAUGHING in back. Clearly, they're friends with Blaze.

                         JED

                         (SHOUTING)
          Skin of your teeth, man!

                         MURPHY
          (tapping his watch)
          Yeah, we're on a tight schedule!

                         BLAZE
          So what are you waiting for?
          Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          EXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY

          A FREIGHT TRAIN thunders across the landscape. To the East
          Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course.
          Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to
          the tracks. Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted
          container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his
          saddles bags --
          -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy
          iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia.
          Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away --
          -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He
          jams the front brake on at the last possible moment --
           The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three-
          sixty up into the car --

          INSIDE THE CAR
          -- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS
          his exhilaration. And if you don't believe this, watch
          extreme motocross as we CUT TO:

          THE OPPOSITE DOOR
          being wrenched aside, revealing Coop's pickup holding steady
          alongside the train. Jed and Murphy ride the cargo bed like
          surfers.
           Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck.
          Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em. We get glimpses of
           the loot: CD Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage --

                         JED
          Christ, Mickey was right on the money!

                         BLAZE
          Car twenty-two!

                         MURPHY

                         (LAUGHING)
          Candy from a baby!
          The boxes keep coming, like baggage at the airport. Some
          boxes miss the mark, fall short, get mangled. A box bursts
          against Murphy's chest, engulfs him in an explosion of paper
          and polystyrene beads. The others howl with LAUGHTER, riding
          high on this Great Train Robbery as -

          4.

                         CONTINUED:
          -- Blaze hears something, looks over his shoulder. He SEES a
          POLICE CRUISER, far in the distance, burning towards them.

                         BLAZE
          Thank you gentlemen, that's it for today!
          Jed bangs on the cab roof. Coop waves. Jed and Murphy
          salute. The pickup peels away. Blaze retrieves his bike.
          Stands it back up, kicks it alive, guns the throttle and --
          -- cold jumps straight out of the car. Seconds later he's
          powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards
          the horizon.
           Far, far behind, the police are still coming.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SIMPSON HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          CHUCK AND RITA SIMPSON (50s) are eating Chinese food with
          their daughter, ROXANNE (20s) and Blaze. Roxanne is
          beautiful, easygoing. She's also seven months pregnant.
          The Simpsons are simple, working-class folk. Judging by the
          strained atmosphere, it's evident that they don't care too
          much for Blaze.

                         RITA

                         (TO CHUCK)
          Hon, would you pass me the vegetables.
          Chuck obliges, takes a drink of his beer, nods to Blaze.

                         CHUCK
          So how're things going at the shop, John?

                         BLAZE
          (scarfing down his food)
          Good, good.

                         CHUCK
          (not buying it)
          Yeah? Cause Mike says you've been
          slacking off, horsing around.

                         ROXANNE
          (annoyed, protective)

                         DALD __

                         BLAZE

                         (ALL SMILES)
          It's okay, Rox.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          S.

                         CONTINUED:
          Blaze sets his fork down, wipes his mouth with his napkin.
          Conjures up his best earnest look.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Truth is, Mr. Simpson, I've been thinking
          about clearing out of there. Maybe
          opening up a shop of my own --
          Roxanne raises an eyebrow at this. News to her.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          See, I've been saving up. You know, for
          the baby and all. And I--
          DOORBELL. Roxanne rises to get it.

                         CHUCK
          You were saying?

                         BLAZE
          (distracted, looking to the

                         DOOR)
           Right, so anyway --

           ROXANNE (O. S . )

                         JOHN --
          Blaze looks over. Two Sheriff's Deputies, LUCAS COLE and
          RICK GEORGE, are standing in the doorway. Roxanne looks
          pissed -- like this isn't the first time this has happened.
          Blaze stands, approaches. Clearly, he knows them both.

                         BLAZE
          (cocky, wary)
          Lucas. Rick.

                         COLE
          Johnny. We'd like you to come down the
          station.
          Their demeanor is hard. Won't take "no" for an answer.

                         BLAZE

                         (INSOLENT)
          Can I finish eating?
          Nope. Blaze squirms, feels Roxanne's eyes on him. He turns
          to her, tries to explain.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Don't worry, hon. It's just routine --

                         ROXANNE

                         (TERSE)
          It is by now. Just let me know if you're
          staying overnight.
          She goes back to her dinner.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze enters. The apartment is dark- TV flickers. Roxanne
          is sleeping on the couch. On the coffee table: Chinese
          leftovers, fortune cookies.

                         BLAZE
          Hey.
          She's sound asleep. He crouches, touches her face.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          Hey.
          Roxanne barely stirs, deeply groggy.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Everything's cool.

                         ROXANNE

                         (SLURRED)
          You're going to jail.

                         BLAZE
          No. No. Everything's okay. Jed and
          Murph just got a little boisterous at The
          Prairie Dog last night. Cops wanted to
          read us the riot act, that's all --
          She yawns, curls up, starts to drift away again.

                         ROXANNE
          I was worried about you. And I don't
          like your friends.
          But Blaze won't let her go back to sleep. He jostles her.

                         BLAZE
          Listen, I want to show you something --

                         ROXANNE
          I'm sure you do. But I'm half-asleep and
          you're an ass-hole.

                         BLAZE
          I'm serious, Rox. This is important.
          He drags her up off the couch. Makes her stand up. She
          MOANS, scowls, but he gets her on her feet.

                         ROXANNE
          John, I have to go to work tomorrow

                         BLAZE
          (offers her coat)
          Put your coat on. You'll be glad you
          did. Promise. It'll be an adventure. A
          mystery tour.

                         ROXANNE
          This better be good.
          She stomps to the bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals
          a fortune cookie from the left-overs, snaps it open --
          The fortune is blank. Both sides. He tosses it away.

                         CUT TO:

                         COYOTE EYES
          glittering black, watching.

           ROXANNE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Alright, I'm here. Now what?

           EXT. DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

           Blaze and Roxanne creep through a hole in the outer fence,
          making their way to --

                         BLAZE
          Keep going. It's just up there.

          A BROKEN-DOWN CAROUSEL
          Must have been magnificent in its day.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm not riding one of those stupid
          horses.

          You don't have to ride, just climb up.
          She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him.

                         ROXANNE
          You're going to have to grow up one day,
          Johnny Blaze.

                         BLAZE
          Not if I can help it.
          He follows her up onto the ride. She weaves through the
          wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this secret adventure.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Keep going, keep going --
          She comes around the other side, catches her breath. The
          whole valley is spread out before her -- a glorious scatter
          of diamonds on velvet.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Uh-oh.

                         ROXANNE

                         (TURNING BACK)
          What?

                         BLAZE
          Ever hear of a carnival wedding?
          Roxanne shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new
          dollar bill, folding it, making something.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          If a man and a woman walk around a
          carousel going backwards, they're
          considered hitched.

                         ROXANNE
          You made that up.

                         BLAZE
          Swear to God.
          He finishes folding the bill. The "one" is now neatly set on
          top of an ORIGAMI WEDDING BAND like a paper jewel.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          You want this?

          She nods, offering her hand. He slips the ring onto her
          finger and she examines it, lit up inside.

                         ROXANNE
          It's beautiful.
          He smiles at her joy, wrestles with what he's about to say.

                         BLAZE
          How'd I ever find you?

                         ROXANNE

                         (SHRUGGING)
          Fate?

                         BLAZE
          I don't believe in fate.

                         ROXANNE
          Maybe it believes in you.
          They hug each other fiercely. A long, soulful embrace.
          Blaze looks to the city lights beneath them once more.

          ROXANNE (CONT ' D)
          Here's the thing, John. We're having a
          baby. You can't keep acting like
          everything's a game. I need you with me.
          I need to know I'll be able to wake up in
          the morning and see your face next to
          mine. Not have to worry that you spent
          the night in jail.

                         (BEAT)
          That's not a life. At least not one I'm
          interested in living.

                         BLAZE
          I know. I'm gonna get my shit together.
          For Leal, this time,

                         (EARNEST)
          I promise you, Rox. I'll always be there
          for you.
          She takes his hand and places it on her belly.

                         ROXANNE
          Don't promise me, promise her.

                         THE COYOTE
          blinks. THUNDER from the next scene prelaps as we

          INT. BLAZE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          WHAM! Blaze enters, drenched from head to toe, frantic.
          Roxanne's arms are filled with laundry.

                         BLAZE
          We gotta go. Get your stuff together.

                         ROXANNE
          What happened? What's wrong?
          Roxanne follows Blaze into the bedroom.

                         ROXANNE (CONT'D)
          What did you do?

                         BLAZE
          I fucked up. The police are coming.
          Grab your things. We have to go.
          She sags, clearly been through this before. He tosses a
          suitcase onto the bed, looks back at her.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Just do it, Rox!

                         FOLLOWING BLAZE
          as he storms into the bathroom. Reaches behind the high
          cistern, retrieves a hidden HANDGUN. He jumps down. Tears
          the side panel off the old bath tub. There's a stack of FLAT
          BLACK BOXES hidden within. Blaze drags them out, drops one -
          It pops open, spilling UNCUT DIAMONDS all over the floor.
          Blaze CURSES, struggles to gather up the loot.

           ROXANNE (O.S.)
          Jesus, Johnny --

                         ON ROXANNE
          standing in the doorway. She sawit all.

          EXT. BLAZE'S APARTMENT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Rain hammers down. SIRENS whine. Blaze shoves Roxanne and
          the suitcase into a beat-up El Camino.

          INT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT

           Blaze climbs behind the wheel, guns the engine even before
           Roxanne has buckled in. He gnashes into reverse, grinds the
          car into a backwards spin --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           -- nearly clipping another car pulling in. He jumps the curb
          and races off into the rain --

          INT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT

          -- passing a POLICE CAR coming the other way. Roxanne
          glances at Blaze, angry and disappointed.
          Blaze struggles. The rain. The wipers. The fogging
          windshield. It's a bad time to be Johnny Blaze.

                         BLAZE
          Fuck.

          BLAZE'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR POV:
          The cop car is turning, heading back in their direction.

                         ROXANNE

                         JOHN --
          Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer leaps.

          EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

          The EL Camino screams through the rain, with the cop car in
          dogged pursuit. TWO MORE POLICE CARS fall in behind them.

          INT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT

          Blaze fights to keep it together. The road ahead is
          dangerously winding. Tires SQUEAL as he hauls a sketchy turn.
          Roxanne gasps, fearful, bracing herself. The police are
          gaining. FLASHING LIGHTS flood the interior.

                         ROXANNE
          Slow down, John --
           Another sketchy turn. Blaze spins the wheel, brakes, hard.
           Too hard. The car hydroplanes, finds purchase --

           ROXANNE (CONT ' D )

          SLOW DOWN!
          LIGHTNING flashes, and suddenly, there's a

                         COYOTE
          or, the road, right in their path.

                         CONTINUED:
          Blaze jerks the wheel. Roxanne SCREAMS. The car skids,
          slews off the road, CRASHES through a guard rail --
          It plunges down a washout, flips end over end, shedding glass
          and wreckage, finally SLAMMING to a dead stop at the bottom
          of a rocky arroyo.

          INSIDE THE EL CAMINO
          Blaze stirs, blood streaming down his face. The windshield
          is blown open. Rain pours in.

                         BLAZE
          Roxanne --?
           He struggles to free himself from his seat, SEES a torn seat
          belt hanging beside him -- the passenger seat mr)ty.

                          BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Roxanne?!

          EXT. ARROYO - NIGHT

          Blaze scrambles out through the broken windshield. Falls off
          the wreck onto the steep, muddy incline. He tries to stand,
          can barely manage to crawl.

                         BLAZE
          (terror seizing him)

          ROXANNE!!!

                         ON ROXANNE
          lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe dead. Blaze
          scrambles to her, rolls her over. He hauls her into his
          arms, SOBBING, the two of them covered in mud and glass and
          God knows what.

                         TROOPERS
          are coming down the incline, guns drawn, FLASHLIGHTS beaming.
          They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of Roxanne.

           BLAZE (O.S. ) (CONT'D)
           Let me see her! God-Dammit! I have a
          right to see her --

          ANGLE ON Blaze, grief-struck, handcuffed, thrashing about as
          Troopers try cc restrain him.

                         BLAZE
          Get your fucking hands off me!
          Lucas Cole, the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier,
          approaches. Blaze SEES him and calms down a little.

          BLAZE (CONY' D)
          Please. Just let me see her.
          Cole nods to his men, who ease up on Blaze. He guides Blaze
          over to an observation window --

                         THEIR POV
          Roxanne lays in a surgery bay, DOCTORS and NURSES milling
          around her.

           DOCTOR (O.S.)
          Mr. Blaze --?
          Blaze turns, SEES a nervous DOCTOR standing behind him.

                         BLAZE
          Is she going to make it?

                         DOCTOR
           (blinks, stutters)
          Mr. Blaze, I --

                         DOCTOR
          We don't know. She's critical. Her
          injuries are grave. There's a real
          chance she won't --

                         BLAZE
          What about the baby?
          The doctor hesitates, glances at Cole.

                         DOCTOR
          I'm so sorry. We did everything we
          could.
          Blaze's will shatters as the full realization of what he's
          done slams into him. Tears sting his cheeks. Cole gives him
          space. Whatever punishment awaits Blaze can't be any worse
          than the hell he's living through now.

          INT. ICU WARD - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON Roxanne, on life support, hooked up to an array of
          monitors. Sleeping Beauty, still as death. Blaze sits
          beside her bed. Handcuffed. Numb. Rain streams against a
          nearby window. Tree limbs tap against the glass, like ghosts
          scratching to get in.
          TWO STATE TROOPERS stand guard at a respectable distance,
          MURMURING to each other. Elsewhere --

                         BOOTS
          walk purposefully on linoleum. Passing bay after bay.
          Beyond the Troopers, SOMEONE is approaching, half seen
          through layers of glass.
          Blaze HEARS the footsteps, lifts his weary head. The shadow
          keeps coming, half-glimpsed between partitions as it draws near.

          THE ICU LIGHTS
          flicker and weaken as if some unseen force were sapping their
          intensity. Blaze glances at the machines. Still ticking --

          AMBROSE STARKE ( 60S)
          steps into view. Duster-coat. A wide-brimmed cowboy hat. A
          smiling stone face. Blue eyes flecked with silver grey. He
          steps between the Troopers. They keep talking, don't even
          seem to notice him.

                         STARKE
          You look like you could use some help.
          Blaze glances at the troopers. They're still completely
          unaware of Starke's presence. It's as if Starke and Blaze
          have somehow stepped a split-second sideways in time.
          The lights around them continue to dim. The second hand on
          the wall clock stops. An eerie, dreamlike moment -- the wind,
          the rain, the tree branches tapping against the window pane.

                         BLAZE

                         (LOST)
          She's dying.
          Starke nods, places a COIN in Blaze's palm.

                         STARKE
          If I could help her, would you be willing
          co make a deal?

                         CONTINUED:
          Blaze looks at the coin -- gleaming, golden, embossed with a
          soaring eagle on one side, a coyote on the obverse.

                         BLAZE
          What kind of deal?

                         STARKE
          She lives. You work for me.
          Something about Starke's eyes. Commanding and haunting at
          the same time.

                         BLAZE
          What kind of work?
          Starke just keeps smiling. Lays a comforting hand on Blaze's
          shoulder as we drift towards Roxanne's beeping EEG.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          When I was young, I was told that our
          souls wander while we sleep. Sometimes
          they get lost. Sometimes they never make
          it back --

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DUSK

          FADE IN on John Blaze as he switches on the light, looks in
          the mirror. Those five years of work have taken their toll.
          A haggard reflection gazes back at him, He stares. And
          stares. Right into his pain.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          -- but if they dQ return, they bring
          messages. And I guess thhat's how the
          dead speak to us -- in memories that may
          be dreams, and dreams that feel like
          memories.

          The store is empty. The CLERK prices cigarette packs, eyes a
          suspicious Native American woman, NOMI (30s), as she loads a
          basket with basics. Nomi sets the basket down on the
          counter. The clerk starts scanning the bar codes.

           out her half-breed daughter --

          RAIN (8) ,
          who is sorting intently through a rack of cheap toys. The
          kid is quiet, soulful, old beyond her years.

          Nomi turns, SEES Rain clutching a toy -- a glow-in-the-dark
          Halloween skeleton.

                         NOMI
          It's too much, baby. Put it back. I
          don't have enough money for that.
          Rain stares right at Nomi -- and brazenly slips the doll into
          her coat pocket. Nomi glances at the Clerk. He didn't notice.

          EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN/DEADFALL GAS STATION - DUSK

          It's pouring rain. Nomi and Rain hurry across the muddy lot
          towards a ratty pickup.

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          Yeah, I found her. Came back to be with
          her dying grandpappy.

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT
          BILLY-RAY CARRIGAN (30s) paces under an tire bay awning,
          talking on a cell-phone. He's handsome, charming, but
          there's evil lurking within that slick exterior. A pencil-
          thin scar runs just under one eye.

                          CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
           Don't worry. She's got the kid with her.
           Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup. The
           pickup chokes to life, carves out of the lot. Carrigan nods

                         TO --
          -- LANDSDALE ( 40s), a stone-faced criminal, who motions to
           five other thugs lounging nearby -- FUSCO, ALBRIGHT,
           CHUDACOFF, LLOYD and ODELL.

                          CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          (listening, impatient)
          I remember the deal. Just make sure you
          bring the money.
          He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting
          nearby -- a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and
          Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan.
          Carrigan pulls a Glock from his waistband, chambers a round.

                         CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          Who wants to be a millionaire?
          Landsdale smiles back, an awful smile.

          WOMAN (V.O.)
          Some people are born bad. That's just
          the way they come into the world.
          Something goes wrong. Something breaks
          inside of them --
          The trucks pull away, tires ploughing muddy tracks, passing
          two STRAY DOGS fighting over a bloody road-kill carcass.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - BEDROOM - DUSK

          Blaze sweeps aside a curtain, studies the slowly darkening
          landscape outside with tired resignation.

          WOMAN (V.0.)
          -- and they spend the rest of their lives
          trying to make up for it.

          PAN OVER Blaze's belongings on the bureau -- a duffle bag,
          old photographs of his previous life with Roxanne, a
          collection of blank postcards. Tucked amidst the photos is a
          sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child.

          Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it. The map is
          crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city,
          along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations. Blaze
          traces his finger down to his present location: DEADFALL.

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          A lonesome service road threads through bleak wild-grass
          prairie. Nomi's pickup appears on the horizon.

          INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - DUSK

          Nomi glances at Rain, who clutches her new skeleton toy.

                         NOMI
          Seatbelt.
          Rain dutifully fastens herself in.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Hey, bug. You hungry?
          Rain shakes her head-

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Want to listen to music?
          (off Rain's sullen shrug)
          Look, we won't have to keep moving around
          forever, okay? I'll figure something
          out. I promise.
          Rain looks at her mother. She's heard it all before-
          WHAM! Somebody rams the truck from behind. Rain SCREAMS.

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK

          Blaze reaches for a pack of cigarettes, lights a match. He
          stares at the match flame for a moment -- for the flame is
          behaving strangely, bending towards Blaze as if it were drawn
          -o T>; m. Blaze shakes out the match, then retrieves --

          THE COYOTE/EAGLE COIN
          He stares at it ruefully, then places it on the map and sets
          it spinning. We get the sense that this is a ritual he has
          performed many times before. As we MOVE IN on the coin --

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          CRASH! The Tundra rams Nomi's pickup again. Nomi fights to
          keep control. Aims for a turn-off up ahead. She hauls the
          truck into the turn, fights the roll-over, barely makes it --
          -- but it's not fast enough. The Tundra and the Bronco make
          the turn too. Their HEADLIGHTS blaze into the cab. Nomi
          floors the gas. The pickup judders. The road here is
          bumpier, cracked and pocked.
          The Bronco swings out, pulls up alongside Nomi. She glimpses
          Landsdale, LAUGHING, urging Carrigan on. Carrigan cuts
          right, SLAMS the Bronco into Nomi's side.

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK

          On Blaze, watching the coin with a growing sense of fatalism.
          Spinning. Spinning. But starting to slow now --

          EXT_ ROAD - DUSK
          WHAM! The Bronco collides with Nomi's door again. Glass
          shatters- Rain WAILS, terrified. Wind and rain rush in --
          BLOWOUT! Front offside tire. Nomi loses it, careens right,
          carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert, SMASHING over
          rocks, sagebrush, fence posts and barbed wire --
          After a few dozen tortured yards, the pickup shudders to a
          stop. The Bronco and the Tundra haul up nearby, engines
          CHUGGING like hungry beasts.

          IN THE PICKUP
          Nomi angrily drags her seatbelt off, snatches a revolver from
          the glove box. She looks to Rain:

                         NOMI
          Stay here. And lock the doors.
          Nomi climbs out into the rain, SLAMS the door. Rain works
          the locks, but the driver's side is all bent up and twisted --

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          Nomi approaches the trucks, blinded by halogen high-beams.
          SILHOUETTES are coming towards her. She raises the revolver --

                         NOMI
          Back the fuck off!
          LANDSDALE comes from left of nowhere, twists the gun from her
          hands in one unexpected move. She spins, SEES Carrigan
          approaching -- and recognizes him instantly.

           NOMI (CONY' D)
          Billy-Ray --?

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL -- DUSK

          On Blaze, watching the spinning coin. He shuts his eyes, as
          if he could stave off what he knows is coming next. As if he
          could contain the thing that is, even now, clawing its way
          into his body from some dark circle of hell.

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          CRACK! Nomi falls to her knees, dimly aware of her daughter
          SCREAMING. Carrigan stands over her, massaging his fist.

                         CARRIGAN
          Well, if it isn't Little Miss Running
          Bear.
          He grabs her by her hair, shoves the Glock beneath her chin.

                         CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          Gentlemen, you are looking at one of the
          finest pieces of ass I have ever had the
          good fortune of defiling.

                         NOMI
          Fuck you, Billy --

                         CARRIGAN
          Now I might just take you up on that,
          Nome. Old Billy-Ray's been getting a
          little tired shaking hands with the
          governor, know what I'm saying?

          IN THE PICKUP CAB
          Landsdale and his men are trying to get the doors open. Rain
          scoots to the driver's side, tries to start the engine. But
          the driver's door is wrenched open and the men are on her -

          Careful with her!
          Rain is dragged kicking and screaming from the cab.

          ON NOMI,
          struggling to free herself, desperate to help her child.

                         NOMI
          Leave her alone!
          Rain fights like a hellion, rakes her fingernails across
          Odell's face.

                         ODELL
          Fuck!
          SLAP! Landsdale back-hands the little girl. As she reels,
          he binds her hands with duct tape, then picks her up and
          throws into the Bronco.

                         NOMI

          YOU COCKSUCKERS!

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK

          The coin slows. Blaze opens his eyes, a look of dread
          washing over his face. He stares at his hands -- they're
          shaking, emitting a HEAT HAZE.

          EXT. ROAD - DUSK

          THUNDER explodes. LIGHTNING flashes. The men gather round
          to watch Carrigan beat Nomi unmercifully. He knocks her back
          into the mud. She tries to crawl away, blinded by the rain.

          INT. LAKOTA MOTEL - NIGHT

          The coin comes to a stop, coyote-side up.
          Blaze SCREAMS, his body wracked with pain. He begins to
          violently shake, his muscles twisting in unnatural
          contortions. With a combustive WHOOSH his face abruptly
          CATCHES FIRE and --

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          CRACK! SMACK! Carrigan delivers the coup-de-grace. Pistol
          whips Nomi with the Glock. Her head snaps back. Blood sprays
          in deep slow-motion, spatters the bronco's headlights --

          Nomi struggles backwards through rivulets of mud. Carrigan
          looms over her. All she can do is stare up at him, glassy
          and unfocused as rain spatters her face.

                         CARRI GAN
          Tell you what, Hon. You want your
          goddamned divorce so much?
          He aims the Glock at her face, about to pull the trigger as --

                         CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
          You can fucking have it!
          -- a GUT-WRENCHING HOWL cuts through the night, echoing off
          the canyon walls. Carrigan and his cronies take a beat,
          staring through sheets of rain.
          Silence. Just the relentless downpour.

                         ODELL
          The hell was that?
          The men glance at each other, nervous. A THUNDER-QUAKE
          rumbles, so low and gritty it'll rattle your fillings.
          The men look around, frightened. Rocks fall from the
          surrounding butte. Odell looks down. The SOUND is deafening,
          vibra tine: the very earth. And that's when it happens:

          A FLAMING RED-HOT MONSTER-CYCLE
          leaps from atop a wedged outcrop, ridden by SOMETHING that
          SCREAMS and BURNS. Silent SLOW MOTION. Heat haze, glowing
          manifolds. The bike catches twenty feet of air, trailing
          fire like a comet's tail as it passes right over their
          disbelieving heads.
          What.
          The.
          Fuck.
          Touchdown. A BLAST-WAVE of heat and flame billow outward.
          The men shield themselves, stumbling backwards. The bike
          hauls a deep carving turn, peeling mud, slides to a dead
          stop, hissing in the driving rain.
          Time stands still. Carrigan and his men gape. The monster
          cycle throbs.

          Alive. Evil. Aflame. A man but not a man -- an impossible
          spectre, engulfed in fire, its skullish head deeply bowed.
          Clinking coils of red-hot chain slip link by link through its
          skeletal, flickering fingers. Then it lifts his terrible

                         HEAD --

          THE FACE OF JOHN BLAZE
          Skeletal, aflame, but somehow still Johnny, his tortured
          visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white.
          His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an INHUMAN HOWL, at once
          predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal damnation.
          Time speeds up again. The men run. The Ghost Rider
          accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat.
          Lloyd runs fast as he can. Talk about pointless. The Ghost
          Rider seizes his head, drags him seventy yards, burning him
          black, discarding him --
          The other men let rip. Guns blaze. BULLETS punch through the
          Ghost Rider, coming out his back as red hot slag. The demon
          hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his rear wheel --

                         ALBRIGHT
          What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?!
          Albright FIRES his shotgun. THUNDERING past like an Amtrak
          train, the Ghost Rider PUNCHES a flaming fist right through
          Albright'-, face.
          That's it for the others. They scramble for the trucks.
          WHOOSH! The Ghost Rider lashes out with his chains, lassos
          Chudacoff. He SCREAMS as the metal sears his body, falls
          heavily, burning --
          The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons something internal
          and lets it loose -- a blast of PURE HELLFIRE that courses
          down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him.
          The men make the trucks, pile in. Landsdale slams the Tundra
          into drive. The big truck hauls away.
          Carrigan fights to get the Bronco into gear. Rain peeks out

          suddenly we are --

          INSIDE THE BRONCO'S ENGINE
          A series of MACRO SHOTS as we move amongst the pistons,
          cylinders, and intake manifolds. The mixture of vaporized
          fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite, but then the
          miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon
          themselves and we are --

                         BACK OUTSIDE
          with Carrigan. His truck won't start. Somehow, the ?host
          Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine.
          The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers
          white-hot now, throbbing with heat. He slices through the
          Bronco's door like a human oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the
          vehicle apart.
          Carrigan panics, drags Rain out the passenger door. But
          Fusco is still trapped inside. Can't get his seatbelt off.
          The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the vehicle and
          HURLS the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted
          back seat. The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a
          skeletal claw --

                         FUSCO
          Oh God, please, I ain't nothing to do
          with nothin'. I ain't nothin'. Please,

          tugging Rain away from the horror, trying to ignore Fusco's
          terrible SCREAMS. He looks back, wishes he hadn't --
           The Ghost Rider has Fusco snatched up nose-to-nose, forcing
          the man to look right into --

          THE GHOST RIDER'S EYES
          Hungry black sockets that suck the fire from the air.

                         FUSCO
          shudders, eyes bulging. All he can do is stare into those
          awful pits, fall into them, as grisly IMAGES from his evil
          past spark and shred into his melting mind.
          Every act of violence, every crime he ever committed --
          beatings, murders, acts of torture and revenge -- are now
          revisited upon Fusco tenfold. This is the PENANCE STARE, and
          Fusco is feeling it's full, hellish force. The Ghost Rider
          and Fusco SCREAM in sync.
          Carrigan and Rain can't look away. They stand transfixed --
          Then it's over. The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud.
          He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but
          still alive, his brain irrevocably overloaded.
          And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too. Immobile.
          Internal. Then he looks up, past Carrigan. R;rht at. Rain.
          Rain stares back. But it's --

                         BLAZE'S FACE
          she SEES. An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment.
          And Rain's terror is forgotten for just that moment, replaced
          with something best described as empathy.

          LIGHT AND NOISE
          to the Ghost Rider's left. He turns -- the Tundra screams
          out of nowhere, slamming into him at sixty plus.

          INSIDE THE CAB
          LANDSDALE ducks the shattering windshield, leaps from the
          truck as it fills with fire --
          The Tundra keeps moving, pile-drives the howling spectre
          square into a massive boulder. The truck compresses like an
          accordion, EXPLODES, engulfs the rock with fire --
          Landsdale picks himself up, ready for anything. Carrigan
          tugs Rain over. The wreckage burns out of control.

                         CARRIGAN
          Did you kill it --?

                         LANDS DALE
          Fuck if I know!!!
          Just then, Nomi's pickup backs into view. Odell is driving.
          Ca___gan snatches Rain up like baggage, starts forward.

                         ON NOMI
          dazed, in a muddy gully. She scrambles up to the lip, SEES
          the burning Tundra nearby, SEES her pickup hauling away into
          the night. She WAILS, tries to drags herself to her feet --
          CREAK. The burning wreckage moves. Moves again. Nomi ducks
          down, watches, uncomprehending. The crumpled truck is hurled
          aside. Two tons. Tipped over like a packing crate.
          Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with fear. HEAVY
          FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near --
          Nomi dares to look up. The Ghost Rider stares down at her.
          Like Death itself. Imagine yourself face to face with a
          Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable force of nature --
          Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you. The world
          exhales. After a moment Nomi dares to look again:

          NOMI'S POV (THROUGH THE POURING RAIN)
          All she sees is a MAN, in tattered clothes, rolling a busted
          up motorcycle away into the darkness.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL - TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT

          Graveyard shift but the floor is busy. Too many accidents,
          too few staff. And the POLICE and PARAMEDICS hovering here
          and there are just getting in the way.

          ON BLAZE,
          stumbling through the crowded ward, head down, in obvious
          pain. OR. QUINLAN ( 30s, harried), struggles to keep up,
          filling out paperwork on the fly.

                         QUINLAN
          Sir, you have to tell me your name.

                         BLAZE
          I just need to sit down for a moment.
          And I need some forceps, gauze, tape --

                         QUINLAN
          I'll decide what you need, alright?
          Name?
          Blaze hauls a curtain aside, finds an empty surgery bay,
          prepped and ready to go.

          SHOUTING MEDICS tear past, pushing a SCREAMING BURN VICTIM on
          a gurney. Blaze ducks into the curtained bay. Quinlan
          follows.

                         QUINLAN (CONT'D)
          Sir, I can't help you if you don't
          cooperate.
          (beat, pointedly)
          Are you on something? Drugs?
          Blaze pulls at his jacket, easing it over his battered body.

                         BLAZE
          No, no. Do I look like troub-unghhh --
          He grimaces as the jacket comes off. Bullet wounds, shotgun
          damage, torn flesh, and a lot of BLOOD.

                         QUINLAN

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          Oh -- my. What happened to you?
          Blaze sits back on the bed, sets about cleaning his wounds
          with tools laid out on a tray nearby.

                         BLAZE
          Motorcycle accident. Couple abrasions,
          maybe some rib fractures --
          (Quinlan tries to help)
          Just step back, I'll handle it --

                         QUINLAN
          Those are bullet holes.
          Blaze cleans the wounds she's referring to, grits his teeth
          as he swabs gauze deep into his flesh.

                         BLAZE
          Nah. They're just -- gouges. Surface
          damage. They'll heal up fine. Ungh -
          do you have any -- painkillers?

                         QUINLAN
          (assertive now, plainly

                         SUSPICIOUS)
          This was no motorcycle accident.
          Somebody has cauterized your wounds
          Blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound.

                         BLAZE
          Percocet? Vicodin, maybe?

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Blaze pulls a vicious shard of metal out of his side, stifles
          a SCREAM, fights to keep it together.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          Just. Give. Me. Something. For. The.
          Pain.
          He staunches the blood, fixing her with such a stone stare
          that she involuntarily backs away.

                         QUINLAN
          I'm sorry -- but I need to report this.
          Stay right there.
          Quinlan backs out through the curtain. Blaze sighs, tapes a
          thick gauze patch over the wound, eyes hunting. He SEES a
          drug cabinet, breaks into it. Fills his pockets.

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Moments later, Blaze is stumbling away. He pops the cap of a
          pill bottle, dry-swallows a half-dozen painkillers --
          To his right, a PARAMEDIC TEAM works on the shrieking burn
          victim we saw earlier. Blaze stops, horrified --
          It's FUSCO, eyes rolling wildly, charred nearly beyond
          recognition. Flailing and convulsing, fingers nothing but
          exposed, blackened bone --

          ON BLAZE,
          backing into a quiet corner. He suppresses a sob, fumbling a
          hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine. He jabs the
          spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect.
          After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that
          he's leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned --

          A WANTED POSTER,
          helpfully illustrated with a mug-shot of Blaze's own face.
          Blaze tears the poster down, stuffs it in his pocket, then
          realizes that SOMEONE is watching him. He turns, SEES --

                         NOMI
          sitting on a nearby bed. Beaten, bruised, desolate. A PAIR
          OF STATE TROOPERS are questioning her. She stares past them,
          straight at Blaze. She recognizes him.

                         (ICN-=NU_^)

                         CONTINUED:
           Ice water floods Blaze's veins. He hurries away.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

          Blaze approaches a mailbox, fishes a postcard from his
          backpack. He writes the date, checks the time on his watch
          and jots that down too. He addresses it, drops it in the
          slot. Then he turns around and SEES --
          -- Nomi standing behin him, Jï¿½Iorkina his way.

                         NOMI
          You were there last night.

                         BLAZE
          Excuse me?

                         NOMI
          when they took my daughter.

                         BLAZE
          I don't know what you're talking about

                         NOMI
          Yes you do.
          Blaze tries to pass off his unease with an ill-conjured
          smile. He pushes past her, moving to his battered
          motorcycle. Nomi follows.

          NOMI (CONT' D )
          The Ghost Rider. It walked right past
          me. It let me live.
          (a whisper, intense)
          I know what you are.
          Blaze stares at Nomi, shaken.

                         BLAZE
          Lady, you don't know shit.
          (his tone turning lethal)
          Now bark the fuck o t of my Ii
          Blaze mounts his bike, kicks it alive, leaves Nomi in the
          dust.

          EXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY

          Blaze heads north under a big sky castled with towering white
          clouds.

          Prairie grasslands roll away on either side of the two lane
          blacktop. But Blaze's landscape is deep within and dark,
          dominated by the thunderheads of last night's horror.
          He notches the throttle up a little, cruises at ninety.
          Rolls his head back, lets the wind stream over his face.
          Then he hears ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE. Blaze looks back --

                         NOMI
          pulls alongside Blaze, riding a monster bike of her own.
          Blaze burns away. But Nomi's no slouch. She matches his
          speed and is back beside him moments later. She SHOUTS:

                         NOMI

          PULL OVER! I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!
          Blaze guns the bike again, jinks around an oncoming station
          wagon that blares it's HORN_ But Nomi's still on him --

          NOM I (CONT' D )

          DAMNIT, I NEED YOUR HELP!!!

                         BLAZE

                         (IRRITATED)

          LADY, I'VE HELPED YOU ENOUGH!
          Nomi smiles. Blaze just slipped up and they both know it.

                         NOMI

          I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST RIDER!!!
          Angry with himself, Blaze throttles his bike to the max,
          howling over the next rise on his back wheel, probably
          hitting one-fifteen as he vanishes from view.
          Nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits, her engine
          RUMBLING. Wind blows. Lizards click.
          After a long beat, Blaze reappears. Stops far away on the
          crest of the rise. Stares at her.

          EXT. FOOTHILLS - DUSK

           Blaze and Nomi weave their way through an obstacle course of
           rusted car hulks and assorted junk, heading for a battered
           Airstream trailer perched on the edge of a bluff.

          to help mp-. I know things.

                         BLAZE
          Like what?

                         NOMI
          This thing that's riding you, the Ghost
          Rider. I guess it has a lot of names.
          But the one I grew up hearing was nagi
          ocanl sice. It means the Spirit of
          Vengeance.

                         BLAZE
          You actually believe what you're telling
          me?

          You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I
          can hear the mountains talking to each
          other. And I saw you light up those
          pricks like Chinese New Year last night.
          They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare.

          NOMI (CONT ' D )
          what do you see when you sleep at night?
          The dead? The faces of the people you've
          taken?

          Nomi nods, not sure she believes him. Enters the trailer.

          INT. AIRSTREAM - DUSK

          Dark, shadowy. Curtains drawn tightly shut. Every corner
          crammed with bric-a-brac. On the TV: the football game.
          Blaze sits on a collapsing couch. Nomi hovers nearby. Her
          grandfather HENRI LAFORTE (80s, emphysemic), rambles on in
          Dakotan, pausing only to suck on his oxygen mask. He keeps his
          eyes on the game the whole time, never once looking at Blaze.

                         BLAZE
          (aside, to Nomi)
          Does your grandfather understand English?

          He understands. He just refuses to speak
          it.
          Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts,
          impatient, finally sits forward.

                         BLAZE
          Listen, I don't want to be an ass-hole,
          but can we just fast-forward the whole
          Yoda routine?
          The home team scores! Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask,
          COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze stands. He's out of there.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Feel better, old man.

                         LAFORTE
          (rasping, in English)
          Give me the coin.
          Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze
          hands over the coin. Laforte studies it, starts speaking in
          Dakota again. Nomi translates:

                         NOMI
          The man you're looking for goes by lots
          of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota,
          he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at
          him straight on, you might see a human.
          Look at him out of the corner of your eye
          at one of the in-between times -- dusk or
          dawn, you might see something else.

                         BLAZE
          What does he want?

                         LAFORTE
          Wacokico. Vengeance.

                         BLAZE
          Why?

                         NOMI
          Because it's his nature.
          Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate.

          NOM I (CONT' D )
          Long ago, Coyote could change his shape,
          chop his body into little pieces, causing

          But Eagle, he had a clear eye. And he
          saw Coyote for what he really was. So he
          swooped down, scattered those pieces to
          the winds.
          (beat, drawing a breath)
          The first men, they found the pieces, and
          not knowing what they were, they ate
          them. And that's, how all men came to
          have a little piece of Coyote in their
          hearts. Now Coyote, he'll promise
          anything to get those pieces back.
          There it is. Blaze exhales. He studies Laforte, those
          ancient, wise eyes.

          My grandfather says you've been looking
          in the wrong place. You need to look
          inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's
          weapon. An extension of his rage. But
          it can't ride people unless it has
          something to latch onto in the first
          place. You understand?
          Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back,
          returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to
          rise, Laforte says one final thing:

                         LAFORTE
          Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay?
          Nomi pauses, deciding how to phrase what the old man said.

          What? What'd he say?

          Because he's her father. And he wants

          A POWERFUL DUST STORM
          Raging full force. Blinding dust and debris batter closing
          store fronts. Roof sheeting tears away, street lamps rattle,
          hapless LOCALS struggle to get indoors.
          A lone coyote lopes through the havoc, trotting purposefully
          against the wind, dodging cars, ducking flying boards and
          planks. The animal passes under a sign: "HOWARDSVILLE CAR

                         THE COYOTE
          approaches the phone booth situated beside the rental office.
          Inside the booth, the man is half-seen.

          She's the most important thing in your

          And be careful. She'll kill if she gets
          the chance.
           The man hangs up, turns to look at the coyote staring up at
          him. Once again, we meet --

                         AMBROSE STARKE
          Same sky-blue eyes flecked with metal. Starke and Coyote
          stare at each other, indifferent to the storm raging around
          them- He starts towards the rental office.

          INT. LONE STAR RENT-A-CAR - DAY

          Windows RATTLE. The storm HOWLS. A portly rental agent, JIM
          PETROWSKY, is closing up shop. He gathers his papers, turns
          out the lights. A TV on the counter is on:

                         WEATHERMAN
          -- experiencing extraordinary conditions.
          Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas,
          with reports of extensive damage and
          gusts of up to seventy miles per hour --
          As Pecrowsky turns off the TV, we hear the door CHIME.
          Starke enters, bringing a strong gust of wind with him.

                         PETROWSKY
          Sorry, guy, I'm just closing up.
          Starke looks to a clock on the wall -- it's 4:55.

                         STARKE
          According to the hours posted outside,

          there's a storm coming -- tornadoes,
          whatever. I'm trying to get out of here.
          Starke fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze.

                         STARKE
          I would like to rent a car --
           (reading Petrowsky's name tag)
          -- "Jim" .
          Something in Starke's tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances
          to the window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the
          coyote out there, watching from across the way.

                         PETROWSKY

                         (RELENTING)
          Okay, alright, have a seat.

          Starke, okay. What kind of car were you
          looking for?
          Starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various cars.

                         STARKE
          What about the Cadillac Deville? I
          noticed you had one in your lot outside.

                         PETROWSKY
           Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a
           full-size car? I can give you a Chevy
          Malibu, Ford Taurus --
          Starke deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow
          stronger. Petrowsky shifts in his seat, trying to mask his
          impatience. Were he observant enough, he might also notice
          that the wall clock has stopped.

          Caddy's taken. Now look, I'm trying to
          be accommodating here, but I really am in
          a hurry. So what's it going to be?
          Another beat as Starke stares Petrowsky down. Gradually, the
          lights in the office begin to dim.

                         STARKE
          The Taurus, then.

                         PETROWSKY
          Great. Can I see a driver's license?
          Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license.
          Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore
          the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him.

          PETROWSKY (CONT' D )

          We've got three options. You can
          purchase a full tank in advance, you can
          fill it up yourself before you return it,
          or you can have us do it, but then we
          have to charge you four dollars a gallon.
          Most people go for the tank in advance.
          Less hassle.

                         STARKE
          I'll do it myself.

          Okey-dokey.
          Petrowsky enters the final data, hits "PRINT". As the rental
          agreement begins feeding out, we hear a HORN FiONK.
          Starke turns. A mini-van has pulled up outside. A MOUSY
          WOMAN sits behind the wheel. A BOY sits in the back seat.
          The coyote is still there, but it pays no attention to them.

                         STARKE
          Mrs. Petrowsky?

                         PETROWSKY
          Yeah.
          Petrowsky slides the agreement to Starke, takes out a pen:

          PETROWSKY (CONT' D)
          Here you go. Just your standard rental
          agreement. You get up to 150 miles a day
          for free, twenty cents a mile after that.
          If you want additional personal accident
          insurance it's five dollars a day,
          another nine-ninety-nine if you want the
          loss/damage waiver. Your basic rental
          rate, plus applicable state and local
          tax. You just need to initial here,
          here, and here --
          (indicating various items)
          -- and give me your John Hancock on the
          line right here.
          Petrowsky offers Starke a pen. He doesn't take it. Instead,
          he pulls out a pair of bifocals. With agonizing slowness,
          Starke begins to peruse the rental agreement.

           rate here as $62.99.

                         PETROWSKY

          Starke turns the agreement around for Petrowsky to see.

                         PETROWSKY (CONT'D)
          Geez, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.
          That's the Caddy rate. Guess I entered
          it in by mistake --
          Starke looks up at Petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals,
          the timbre of his voice taking on a decidedly frigid turn.

                         STARKE

                         STARKE
          Then I'd like a new contract specifying
          the appropriate rate.
          Petrowsky squirms, uncomfortable. For in that pregnant
          moment, without either participant uttering at word, the
          entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed.

                         PETROWSKY
          Look, can't we just go with the contract
          we've got here? I'll make a note of it
          and knock a day's rental off the total
          when you return it. What do you say?

                         STARKE
          I say the Devil's in the details.

          CRASH! Petrowsky flies through the plate glass window. He

          broken, horribly mangled.

          There've been times in my life when the

          Helen Petrowsky bolts from the mini-van. The boy watches as
          his mother rushes to her husband's side.

                         HELEN
          Jim?! Jim, what happened?!
          Petrowsky clutches at his wife's arm, trying to speak. A
          shard of glass has penetrated his larynx.

                         PETROWSKY
          -- H-helen -- get -- a--away --
          Petrowsky's eyes widen in horror. Helen follows his gaze

          WOMAN (V.0.)
          Certain twists of that fate felt like
          nothing more than God's spite.

                         STARKE
          strides towards them, his face a veil of unmerciful contempt.
          The dust storm has taken on Biblical proportions, whipping
          and roiling around him, becoming an extension of his fury.
          He snatches Helen up by the throat, snapping her neck with
          inhuman strength, flings her lifeless body to the ground --
          then he brings his boot heel down on Petrowsky'shead.
          crushing it like an _aashell.

           WOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          It was obvious to me that I'd done
          something wrong. Broken some secret rule
          known only to Him. And as such, would be
          punished for my sins --
          Starke turns now, regarding the mini-van. The boy is nowhere
          in sight. He approaches, looks inside. The boy has fled.

          EXT. RENTAL CAR LOT - DAY

          We are low on the ground, tracking with the terrified Boy as
          he squirms his way beneath the cars. He pauses, nervous.

          BOY'S POV (BENEATH CAR)
          Looking right, then left. No sign of Starke. The Boy

                         THE COYOTE
          appears, creeping along a parallel aisle. It pauses,
          lowering its snout, peering at the boy from afar.
          The Boy freezes. FOOTSTEPS approaching. He squirms around
          for a better view --

          BOY'S POV (BENEATH CAR)
          We SEE Starke's boot heels a few dozen yards away, gradually
          closing in on the car beneath which the Boy hides.
          The Boy shuts his eyes. The FOOTSTEPS draw closer, then
          stop. The Boy opens his eyes. Starke's hoots are just an
          arm's length away.

          WOMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          There's a world out there that's neither

          A HUMMER races along a desolate stretch of highway, passing
          through an inhospitable landscape of buttes, mesas, and cacti.

          INT. HUMMER - DAWN

          Carrigan drives. Landsdale rides shotgun, dozing. Odell is
          in back with Rain, her hands tightly bound. She keeps to
          herself, clutching her skeleton doll, stares out at the
          passing landscape. Odell offers her a bag of chips.

                         ODELL
          Want some food, kid?
          Rain doesn't respond. Odell rustles the bag.

                         ODELL (CONT'D)
          C'mon. Eat a chip or something.

                         CARRIGAN
          She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up
          and get some sleep.

                         ODELL
          I can't sleep. Every time I close my
          eyes, I see the face of that thing, Lloyd

          If I could put it out of my head, I
          wouldn't be awake now, would I?
          Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren landscape.

                         CARRIGAN
          Look out there, what do you see?

          Dick.

                         CARRIGAN
          That's right. Miles and miles of
          nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit
          running around in that nothing. How many
          people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten?
          Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn
          paper at the supermarket. You believe

          This wasn't no freaking Bigfoot! You see

          head clean off!

                         CARRIGAN
          Look, I don't know what that thing was.
          All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt-
          load of money to deliver the kid to him.
          We were told we'd see things and we were
          told to look the other way. You want to
          cut out? I'll pull over right here.

                         LANDSDALE
          Keep your shirt on, B. We didn't come
          this far just to limp home with nothing.
          Right, Odell?
          Odell settles back into his seat, uneasy.

                         ODELL
          I guess. But I'd still like to know what
          that thing was.

           One hundred miles-per-hour plus. Whip around to SEE --

          BLAZE AND NOMI,
          riding their cycles. Up ahead is a postal truck. Blaze
          HONKS, waves to the DRIVER. He's got a postcard in his hand.
          He hands it to the driver through the open door, then
          decreases his speed, falling back alongside Nomi.
          As they scream over a hill, we SEE the White Buffalo Indian
          Casino and Lodge in the distance.

                         NOMI
          I don't like this. I spent the last six
          years trying to forget this place.

          A chiming CACOPHONY. Acres of penny slots and video poker.
          Roulette wheels CLATTERING. Blackjack tables spinning.
          Blaze and Nomi weave their way through the maze.

                         BLAZE
          Your husband used to work here?

                         NOMI
          Billy-Ray dealt blackjack, poker. Worked
          the casino circuit. We met in Vegas.
          Things kind of went downhill after that.

          But you must've talked to him. Do you
          know where he's headed? Just tell me
          that.

          as hell wouldn't be telling you.

          Show these two ass-holes to the door.

          Look, this is important. We're talking
          about a kidnapping.

          Plexiglas booths where people dive for dollars.
          The goons pull their pieces. Blaze just ups the pain.

                         BLAZE
          I need you to understand something,
          Vince. I am, by nature, an inherently
          violent man and there's not much in the
          way of bad that I haven't already
          inflicted on this miserable world --
          (applying even more pressure)
          So unless the idea of learning to drive a
          wheelchair with your mouth sounds
          appealing, I suggest you apologize to my
          friend and tell us WHERE THE FUCK BILLY-

           Blaze releases him. As the goons close in, Blaze deftly
          relieving Goon #1 of his handgun and turns it back on him.

                         BLAZE
          Think about it.
          The goons relent. Blaze and Nomi exit, leaving Rodenburg

          A swath of cheap housing, part-finished, mostly abandoned,
          back-boning a steep bluff that overlooks the casino.
          Blaze and Nomi dismount their bikes. She stares at a
          particularly ramshackle house. Wind whips. Dead leaves
          blow. A rusting swing-set twists and creaks.

                         NOMI
          Never thought I'd be back here.
          They pass cautiously through the front yard. Nomi's pickup
          is parked nearby. The front door bangs back and forth. Nomi
          pulls a revolver from her waist-band.

                         BLAZE
          I think they're gone.
          Off Nomi's look, Blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt.

          Dual tracks. Looks like your old man
          switched to a Hummer.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - DUSK

          Window panes RATTLE. The lights don't work. Blaze and Nomi
          pick their way through food containers and discarded detritus.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Guess the boys camped out for a while.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          Dead leaves twirling. One whole side of the room is burned
          open, blackened and charred, the remaining timbers sealed
          with plastic sheeting. Nomi opens a drawer, rifles through
          singed papers -- finds an old PHOTO of her and Carrigan.

                         NOMI
          Listen, those things Vince said --

                         BLAZE
          You don't have to explain yourself to me.

          Some of them are true.

                         BLAZE
          Doesn't make you a bad person.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         CONTINUED:
          Nomi nods, but she's clearly agitated. Blaze crouches,
          traces his fingers over a stain on the wall. He can FEEL
          something. He shuts his eyes, opens them --

          BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST)
          The room, many years earlier. Carrigan backhands Nomi across
          the face. The silent moment is caught in motion so slow it's
          virtually a tableau.

          BACK TO THE PRESENT

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          He used to hit you.
          A statement, not a question. She nods.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Nomi is reluctant to enter. Blaze is inside, SEES her
          hesitation -- she's staring at the bed.

                         NOMI
          You can see the past?

                         BLAZE
          Just echoes, sometimes.

                         (BEAT)
          Tell me about Starke.
          Nomi hesitates, not wanting to relive this.

                         NOMI
          I was dying. I'd shot myself full of
          Billy's best gear. Figured I'd teach him
          a lesson and go out in style.
           Blaze nods, but he doesn't see Nomi now. He SEES --

          BLAZE'S POV (THE PAST)
          -- Nomi as she waS. An inch away from eternity. She is
          lying on the bed, staring upwards, shallow breaths- Above
          her, a MOTH flutters by a light, casting distorted shadows.

          BLAZE (V.O.)
          But it felt like a mistake.

          NOMI ON THE BED

                         (WHISPERS)
          I don't want to die.

                         CONTINUED:
          The lights begin to dim. We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching,
          muted and distorted, A SHADOW falls across Nomi --

                         STARKE
          stands above her. There are OTHER SHADOWS drifting in behind
          him. Things better left half-glimpsed. Coyotes. Beasts.

          NOMI (V.O.)
          He smiled and said --
          As Starke starts to speak, we hear:

                         BLAZE'S VOICE
          "You look like --

          Blaze finishing the phrase, knowing the punch-line too well.

                         BLAZE
          -- you could use some help."
          Nomi nods, hugs herself.

                         NOMI
          And I took it. What else was I going to
          do? I don't know what happened after
          that. I'm not sure I ever want to --
          (beat, struggling)
          All I know is, nine months later, Rain
          was born.

                         FLASHBACK IMAGES
          Silent, disjointed. The moth. Nomi's face, terror-stricken.
          Starke, eyes alight with malice and mischief.

          BACK TO THE PRESENT
          Nomi turns away, trying to banish the memory.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Billy-Ray hated her from the moment she
          was born. He knew she wasn't his, knew
          she was different --
          (re: the charred timbers)
          If I didn't leave he would've killed us
          both.

          Setting the house ablaze.

          BACK TO THE PRESENT
          Nomi pulls out a cigarette, nervously lights it.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Been running ever since. In my heart, I
          guess I knew Starke would be coming for
          her one day.

                         BLAZE
          Why send Billy-Ray after you?

                         NOMI
          Sick irony, I guess. Billy certainly
          knew all my haunts --
          (shaking her head)
          This was a mistake, Blaze. We're not
          going to find anything here.
          Blaze glances down -- a HEAT HAZE has engulfed his hand. He
          clenches his fist, looks up --

                         BLAZE
          Guess again.
          -- as HEADLIGHTS shine through one of the windows.
          Somebody's driving up to the house.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi creep towards the front door. A handful of
          vehicles are pulling up out front. The men disembark. It's
          Rodenburg, finger splinted, packing heat. He's returned with
          reinforcements: OSWALT, DOYLE, WEINGROD and PENNEBAKER.
          Blaze and Nomi make their way to the laundry room and the
          rear entrance -- but Doyle and Oswalt have already circled
          around back.

                         NOMI

                         (WHISPERING)
          Shit, they've got us trapped here.

                         (FATALISTIC)
          No. they're the one who are rang d.
          Blaze reaches for the door handle, opens it --

          What're you --?

          EXT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

           -- and steps out to meet their tormentors. Rodenburg and the
           others are there now too. Rodenburg is grinning.

                          RODENBURG
           Talked-to Billy-Ray, chief. Don't know
           who you a r - e, but you picked the wrong --
          Blaze struggles to contain the Ghost Rider, but his whole
          body is drenched in sweat now -- like he's going to
          spontaneously combust at any moment.

                         BLAZE
          Please. Just tell us where they went and
          leave. There's no reason why you have to
          die.
          Rodenburg LAUGHS, looks at his friends in disbelief.

                         RODENBURG
          I'm gonna die? Me? Buddy, you got your
          head screwed on bass-ackwards!
          Rodenburg FIRES into Blaze's chest -- once, twice. Blaze
          stumbles back against the porch. As he falls, Rodenburg
          mounts the steps, charging in after Nomi.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Nomi runs -- but Weingrod DIVES through the plastic sheeting
          in the hall, cutting her off. He SLAMS her against the wall,
          twisting her arm behind her back.
          Rodenburg appears behind them. Together, he and Pennebaker
          drag Nomi towards the bedroom. They shove Nomi onto the bed.

                         RODENBURG
          Had to come back here, didn't you, Nomi?
          Just couldn't leave well enough alone.
          Nomi struggles to sit up. Rodenburg LAUGHS viciously, forces
          her back, drags at her jeans.

          EXT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

          sits up. He looks to Doyle, TEARS OF FIRE streaming from his
          eyes. As he stands, his chest wounds ignites, the flames
          instantly cauterizing the flesh. He's suddenly engulfed in a
          heat haze. Wood smolders all around him.
          Doyle backs away, terrified. He FIRES his gun again and
          again, but the bullets just punch through Blaze, creating
          more flaming holes-

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rodenburg stops mid-assault. Nomi breathes fearfully, held
           down at gunpoint by Pennebaker. We hear SCREAMS, the
           WHISTLING WIND, the CRACKLE OF FIRE.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

           Doyle rushes in from the porch, looks back --
          Blaze keeps on coming, unstoppable. He steps/burns his way
          through the screen door, leaves a trail of BURNING FOOTPRINTS
          in his wake. As he walks down the hall, the heat streaming
          off of him blisters and curls the wallpaper.
          Doyle backs away, stumbles -- and Blaze is upon him, lifting
          Doyle up, gripping him by the throat.

                         DOYLE

                         P-PLEASE --

                         BLAZE
          I'm sorry.
          soul, the fire expanding, engulfing Doyle.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Rodenburg buckles his pants, goes to the doorway, peers
          cautiously into the passage beyond.

                         RODENBURG'S POV:
          Flaming leaves burn and twirl at the far end. Firelight
          flickers. The SCREAMS still come, sporadic and terrible.
          Rodenburg's mind is racing. He motions to Pennebaker, who
          drags Nomi off the bed and strong-arms her to the door.

          Rodenburg leads, gun ready.

                         RODENBURG
          Doyle?
          Smoke and CRACKLING NOISES are building rapidly. The SHRIEKS
          persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere. Then --
          --- movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead
          but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting,
          fearful, eyes darting. He speaks in a strained whisper.

                         WEINGROD
          What's going on, man? Where's Oswalt?
          GUNFIRE! Outside! CRASH! Something hits the house. Then
          more SCREAMS, more GUNFIRE, and a RUMBLE so deep it's deadly.
          Pennebaker panics, pushing past Rodenburg.

                         PENNEBAKER
          I want out of here, I'm getting out!

                         RODENBURG
          Keep your fucking voices down!

                         WEINGROD
          He's burning the house, man! He's

                         BURNING THE--
          RED-HOT CHAINS whip viciously around Weingrod's head and
          torso. Then he's wrenched backwards, hauled straight through
          the plastic sheeting --

          THE GHOST RIDER
           bursts through the melting plastic, hauls his red-hot monster
          bike up on its back wheel --
          Rodenburg and Pennebaker run for their lives, falling into
          the fire-lit passage. The Ghost Rider screeches across the
          living room, setting the place aflame as he passes through.
          Nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where she was, SEES
          the fiery monster crash straight through the wall --
           Rodenburg and Pennebaker run through the flames, stumbling
          over Doyle's charred body --

          EXT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          They burst out the front door, clothes alight, racing across
          the yard towards their vehicles. Rodenburg looks back --
          The Ghost Rider EXPLODES through the front of the house,
          skids to a halt, flicks out a chain -- and snags Rode burgs
          ankle. He falls, SCREAMING. The chain retracts --
           Pennebaker reaches his vehicle, struggles with the door -
           TheGhost Rider thrusts a clawed hand outwards,clenchesthe
          air and hauls it back in. Like an explosion in reverse, 4,11
          fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being.
          A frozen moment. All terrified eyes on the Ghost Rider
          Then he lets rip. Hurls the energy back out as a torus of
          white hot fire that expands across the yard, BLASTS
          Rodenburg's shirt from his back, SMASHES Pennebaker against
          his vehicle --
          The vehicles EXPLODE, gas tanks rupturing. Pennebaker is
          blown to pieces. Rodenburg SCREAMS, shields his face. Fire
          and debris rain down in every direction. The Ghost Rider
          looms over him. More accurately, it's --

                         GHOST BLAZE
          Half man, half monster, his pitiless skull-face hazing and
          flickering between human and inhuman states.

                         GHOST BLAZE
          Where are they taking the girl?
          Rodenburg whimpers. Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg's hair,
          wrenches his head back.

          GHOST BLAZE (CONT'D)
          Where. Are_ They. Taking. Her?

                         (BEYOND TERRIFIED)
          North! They're headed North, into
          Oregon, oh, god, fuck --

          Where?

          Blue-white fire floods down Blaze's arm and engulfs
          Rodenburg. The poor man screams, struggles to break free --
          aze simply crrows Otte ana ac
          and the Ghost
          Rider's evil countenance submerges every trace of Blaze's
          humanity.
          Then it's over. The flames evaporate. Rodenburg's corpse
          crumbles to dust. Wind HOWLS. The Ghost Rider is gone.

                         ON BLAZE
          He SEES the corpses, the burning vehicles, tries to deny the
          horror. But it's always the same -- another swath of
          destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity.

                         NOMI
          He told you everything he knew.
          She's ten yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Told you everything --

                         BLAZE
          You asked for my help. I warned you what
          you were getting into.
          More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE SIRENS on
          the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

          A sub-par motel 6. Nomi's battered pickup is parked outside.
          We HEAR Blaze's tortured MOANS coming from within.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze sits in a chair, shirt off, Nomi at his side. She's
          trying to help him patch up his wounds, but the enormity of
          the damage and the sheer amount of blood is daunting.

                         NOMI

          Nomi stands, still shaken. She retrieves a cigarette from
          her purse, lights it.

                         NOMI
          I thought you were dead.

                         BLAZE
          (considering his wounds)
          I don't even know if it's that's an
          option anymore. Every time I get close,
          I feel myself being dragged back --
          (breathing through the pain)
          --it's like being born all over again.
          Like every law in the universe is being
          broken.
          Blaze sits forward, gritting his teeth against the pain.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          See, the Ghost Rider -- it's drawn to
          darkness like a bloodhound. If it thinks
          you've sinned, it'll find you.

                         NOMI
          What if you're innocent?

                         BLAZE
          Nobody's innocent.
          (beat, staring at her)
          Think about it. Everyone's done
          somethincr. You. Me --
           Blaze lifts up the coyote coin, flipping it over his fingers.

                          BLAZE (CONT'D)
           Every night I spin this fucking coin --
          and it always lands the same side up. I
          keep thinking -- ona time, one time I'm
          going to spin it and I'll see the other
          face. Sleep through the night without
          getting blood on my hands. But it never
          happens.

                         (SHAKING)
          There's always some sad motherfucker out
          there that needs retribution, vengeance --

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Blaze flings the coin away in disgust. It spins, wobbles,
          lands coyote side up. He laughs tiredly, then looks away,
          lost, suddenly overcome with emotion.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)
          I'm just so fucking tired --
          Nomi moves to his side, struggles to help him up.

                         NOMI
          Here, why don't you lie down for a little
          while?
          Blaze nods, too tired to argue. Nomi half carries him to the
          bed, lowers him down. Blaze settles back, exhausted. Nomi
          watches him, holding vigil. His eyes grow heavy. He shuts
          them a moment, opens them again --

                         THE PAST
          -- and it's Roxanne who is laying beside him now. She rolls
          over to face him, smiles sleepily. Blaze reaches for her,
          touches her face -- and the moment shatters into violence.

          A COLLISION OF IMAGES
          -- the El Camino sliding, spinning over. Metal rending.
          -- rain pattering on broken, bloody wreckage. Roxanne's torn
          seat belt hanging loosely.
          -- climbing out through the blown-out windshield. Crawling
          in mud, Blaze's face reflected in broken glass.
          -- cradling Roxanne's body in his arms, rocking her and --

                         THE PRESENT
          WHAM! Blaze bolts up in bed, disoriented, shaken. Clearly,
          some time has passed.
          Nomi sits across the room now, holding Blaze's tattered
          photographs in her hands, looking a little guilty. She's got
          the paper wedding band which Blaze made for Roxanne too.'

                         BLAZE
          What are you doing?

          As Blaze stands, we SEE that his wounds have healed.-He
          shrugs on a shirt, approaches. Nomi nods to the paper
          wedding band.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          You must've loved her a lot.
          Blaze doesn't answer. Just takes the photos and wedding band
          from her, shoves them back in his pack. He pulls out one of
          the postcards, scribbles an address on it.

                         BLAZE
          What time is it?

                         NOMI
          A little after three.

                         BLAZE
          What time, exactly?

                         NOMI
          3:27. Why?
          Blaze ignores her, jots down the time. Licks a stamp and
          puts it on the postcard. Leaves it on the dresser.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          What is it with you and those postcards,
          anyway?

                         BLAZE
          They're just a kind of record.
          (hauling up his pack)
          Let's go.

          INT. PICKUP - DRIVING - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi drive. Outside, the landscape passes, bugs
          twirling and spattering against the windshield like
          snowflakes.

                         MEMORY FLASHES
          Roxanne in the hospital, serene and beautiful. Starke
          handing Blaze the coin.

                         NOMI
          You made a deal.
          Blaze nods.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          So what happened? Did she live?

          Roxanne? Yeah, she's alive. She just
          doesn't know it.
          (off Nomi' s look)
          Coma. Probably never wake up.

                         NOMI
          So he tricked you.

                         BLAZE
          (a tired laugh)
          That's what he does, doesn't he?
          She nods. That's what he does.

                         NOMI
          (almost afraid to ask)
          What about the baby?
          Blaze just shakes his head.

                         BLAZE
          It's funny. That kid was supposed to be
          my second chance. Rox and I used to talk
          about it -- how things'd be different
          after she was born.
          Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability.

                         NOMI
          Maybe that's why we have them

                         BLAZE

                         (NODDING)
          So we can make amends for all the royal
          fuck-ups we've perpetrated on the world.
          God knows I've had my share.
          (beat, pained)
          I just don't want her to have to pay for
          the things I've done. You know?
          Blaze nods. He knows all too well. He and Nomi drive on in
          silence for a beat, their thoughts turning inwards.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          Can I ask you something? Honestly?
          (off Blaze's nod)

          I don't know. How do you beat the Devil?
          Walk up and bitch-slap him? Pretend
          you're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka
          up his hind ass? I'm basically making

          Nomi smiles.

                         NOMI
          I'm sure you'll figure something out.

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

          -- Rain looking out through the truck's moon roof, watching
          stars passing overhead. As the sky above slowly brightens in
          time-lapse, Rain's eyes grow lidded. She sleeps, clutching
          her skeleton toy and --

          INT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - DAY

          -- waking sunlight floods the cabin. New shift. Odell
          drives. Rain rides shotgun. Carrigan and Landsdale are
          sacked out in back. The radio drones, laced with STATIC.
          Tedium. No one slept well. Carrigan stares out at the
          passing plains, expertly cutting a deck of cards one-handed.
          He SEES a scarecrow go by, standing ragged in the middle of
          nowhere. Then his cell phone RINGS. Carrigan flips it open --

                         CARRIGAN
          Yeah?
          Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He
          sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow.

                          CARRIGAN (CONT'D)
           Rodenburg's dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all
           those other inbred losers too.

          So shut your goddamn mouth --

          You can't tell me what to do. You're not

          Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan
          settles back, but he's pissed.

                         CARRIGAN
          You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm
          just the dumb-ass that financed your
          whole fucking life. You and your mother
          both. And what did I get for that
          selfless act of stupidity? She burned
          down the house and gave me something to

          Huddles against the door.

          She's not listening. Her bound hands are secretly pushed

          ON RAIN'S FINGERS
          extending towards A PEN, one inch out of reach, caught
          between the seat mechanism and the door sill.

          levitates, tilts into her outstretched hands.
          The RADIO squeals painfully, pure strident STATIC. Odell
          punches a new station, but the STATIC continues, grows --
          Rain ATTACKS, stabbing the pen into Odell's thigh. He
          SCREAMS, slams the brakes, loses control of the truck --

          EXT. HIGHWAY/CORNFIELD - DAY

          The Hummer barrels off the road, SLAMS down hard into a
          concrete culvert. Without missing a beat, Rain is out and
          away, plunging into the cornfield. Carrigan and Landsdale
          bolt after her, guns drawn --

          ON RAIN,
          weaving between the stalks. She reaches an old farm
          implement, uses one of the rusting blades to saw through her
          taped bindings. Then she's up again, running --

          ON CARRIGAN AND LANDSDALE
          searching high and low. Carrigan SEES movement to his right,
          surges forward --
          -- but Rain jigs left and Carrigan misses her, tripping over
          the farm implement instead. He cuts himself, curses --
          Rain continues, straight ahead now. Carrigan motions to
          Landsdale. The two split up, drifting in different
          directions. They're gaining on her --

          BACK TO RAIN,
          losing ground. She spies a rock, scoops it up -- and SMASHES

          -- Rain extends her hand, concentrating, eyes fluttering --
          WHOOSH! The gun spins away from Carrigan, into Rain's hands.
          She doesn't hesitate for a second -BLAM!-
           First shot wings Carrigan, knocks Rain on her ass. Carrigan
           DIVES for cover.. She FIRES wildly --CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-- but
          then the gun is spent and --
          -- Landsdale emerges through the corn, bagging Rain with his
          coat. As a shaken Carrigan gets to his feet, Landsdale slips
          his belt out of his pants and binds Rain tightly.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          Carrigan and Landsdale return to the Hummer, which is still
          nose down in the culvert. Landsdale carries Rain under his
          arm, tightly wrapped, no longer struggling.
          Odell sits on the hood, daubing the bloody wound in his leg
          with a handkerchief. He SEES Carrigan's wound.

          How `bout up there?
          Landsdale points past Carrigan at a squat group of buildings
          and machinery -- a shut-down ROCK QUARRY in the distance.

          EXT. QUARRY - FRONT GATE - DAY

          From a distance, we watch as Landsdale approaches a
          guardhouse with an empty gas can. A GUARD opens the electric
          gate, steps out to help. Landsdale pistol-whips him, drags
          his limp body in through the gate.

          INT_ QUARRY OFFICE - DUSK
          The Guard slouches in a corner, bound and gagged. Landsdale
          and Odell lounge nearby, keeping a watchful eye on Rain.
          Carrigan paces by a window, nervously cutting his deck of
          cards one-handed. He's watching the shadows lengthen
          outside, the setting sun. He looks to Rain, who matches his
          gaze -- creepy eyes penetrating his brain.

                         CARRIGAN
          (to Landsdale, anxious)
          Where the fuck are those men of yours?

                         LANDSDALE
          Don't worry. They're on their way.
           Carrigan nods, cuts his cards. He j worried.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK/NIGHT

          The abandoned Hummer in the culvert. A gang of CROWS tear a
          lizard apart. Dusk TIME-LAPSES into night. Stars.
          After a time, Nomi's pickup comes racing past. Blaze is
          driving, cranes to see the passing wreck. He pulls over onto
          the shoulder. Blaze and Nomi climb out, approach the
          vehicle.
          Nomi shines a flashlight, SEES blood on the front seat. She
          GASPS. Blaze reaches past her, touches the blood stain --

          FLASH OF THE PAST
          Chaotic and violent. Rain attacking Odell. The Hummer
          crashing. The desperate race through the cornfield.

                         CONTINUED:

          BACK TO THE PRESENT
          as Blaze steps away from the Hummer, into the field.

                         BLAZE
          She's alive.

                         NOMI
          How do you know ---?
          But Blaze isn't listening. His gaze is now fixated on the
          distant lights of the rock quarry.

          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi crest a rise in the field, hunker down:

                         THEIR POV:
          We can see the main compound of the quarry from here.
          Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the guardhouse.

                         NOMI
          You think she's in there?
          Blaze nods.

                          NOMI (CONT'D)
          Then let's go --
          Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back.

                         BLAZE
          No. We'll wait.

                         (POINTEDLY)
          Dawn's less than an hour away.

                         NOMI
          (taking out her gun)
          You wait. I'm heading in.

                         BLAZE
          Look, they're not going anywhere.

                         NOMI
          You don't know that. This is probably
          the best chance we'll get. They're
          sitting ducks. We can do this if you --

                         BLAZE
          If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their
          spirits?

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          You still get it, do you? The Ghost
          Rider whales on whoever's got it coming,
          but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to
          remember their faces. And I Lb remember
          them. Every last one.
          Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES.
          Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up
          the service road on ratted-out Harleys.

                         NOMI
          They know we're coming, don't they?
          Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him.

                         NOMI (CONT'D)
          I'm going in. You with me or not?

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          Landsdale opens the main gate. The bikers THUNDER into the
          compound -- low-rent Hell's Angel types culled form the
          shallow end of the gene pool known as the Gray Gargoyles.
          ARLO SKINNER, the Gargoyle's CEO, climbs off his hog, adjusts
          his nut-sack. As he approaches Landsdale. GUNT and CHESTER
          PULSIFER, his identical twin lieutenants, fall in behind.

                         ARLO

                         (GRINNING)
          I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers,
          Chester and Gunt?

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT

          Blaze and Nomi scramble over a fence, then drop down, crouch-
          running to avoid a security camera. They hug the shadows.
          At least a dozen of the Gargoyles are in view, lounging
          around, shooting the shit.

                         BLAZE
          I'll find her. You stay here.
          Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her.

          If things go South and the Ghost Rider
          takes over, I can't guarantee he won't --

                         NOMI
          I know. I'm on my own.
          (beat, more plaintive now)
          , Just bring her back to me. That's all I
          care about.

                         BLAZE

                         (NODDING)
          Start disabling the bikes. Last thing we
          need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks
          on our tail. Rip out all the coil wires ---
          Blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him. Nomi rolls her
          eyes and pulls out a switchblade, deftly slicing through a
          fuel line. Gasoline leaks onto the ground.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)

                         (CHAGRINED)
          -- or you could do that.
          As Blaze creeps away:

                         NOMI

                         BLAZE --
          (as he turns back)
          Whatever happens --

                         BLAZE
          You're welcome.
          Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes.

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo enters, accompanied by the Pulsifer Brothers. Carrigan
          and Landsdale are waiting to meet them.

                         ARLO
          So you need some contract work?

                         CARRIGAN
          An escort. We're making a delivery first
          thing tomorrow morning.

                         ARLO
          And will there be mayhem involved?

          Yeah, I'd say a certain amount of hijinx
          are likely to ensue.

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Blaze moves around the back of the compound. Up ahead, TWO
          GARGOYLES are lingering by a side entrance.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo takes out a nail clipper, starts trimming his fingernails.

                         ARLO
          Well, I'll tell you, I got nineteen
          brothers out there willing to go the
          distance and enough firepower to give a
          small Balkan nation a fucking titty-
          twister. But we don't come cheap. So
          how many men we going up against?

                         CARRIGAN
          One.

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          WHACK! Blaze elbows Gargoyle #2 in the face. As the biker
          drops, we SEE that Blaze has already disabled Gargoyle #1.
          Blaze quietly slips in through the door.

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          Nomi has worked her way through a half-dozen bikes now and a
          fair amount of gasoline has pooled on the ground around her.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo looks at Carrigan, incredulous.

                         ARLO
          One man?

                         CARRIGAN
          One man.

                         ARLO
          You trying to diddle my nutpurse, Mister?

                         CARRIGAN
          Absolutely not. Lemme clarify things --

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Blaze sidles down the hallway, moving as quietly as he can.
          We can HEAR the men talking in the office just next door.

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          See, this guy's not really a "guy". He's
          more like a demon or something.

          ARLO (0. S.)
          A demon?

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          That's right.

          ARLO (O.S.)
          What, exactly, do you mean by demon?
          Blaze winces, lifting a hand before his face -- BLUE FLAMES
          dance over his fingertips. He leans against the wall for
          support. When he removes his hand, he leaves a singed palm-
          print on the drywall.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo puts the clipper away, starts arranging the fingernails
          on the desk before him into a neat little pile.

                         CARRIGAN
          Like his head's on fire and shit.
          Arlo LAUGHS, the Pulsifers follow suit. Then Arlo turns to
          Landsdale, icy now.

                         ARLO
          Brotherman, what in fuck's name is this
          smooth faggot talking about?

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Blaze exhales a wisp of BLUE FLAME, totally enveloped in a
          bubble of heat. More than anything, he wants to step inside,
          fully aflame. But he forces himself to simply take a peek --

                         BLAZE'S POV;
          The room, the men -- but no Rain.

                         LANDS DALE
          He's telling the truth, Arlo. The guy
          ain't human. Saw him torch Albright and
          Chudacoff with my own eyes.

          BACK IN CORRIDOR
          Blaze presses against the wall, desperately trying to rein
          the Ghost Rider in -- but FOOTSTEPS are coming. A Gargoyle
          is round; c the corner!

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Gunt rips open his shirt, shows a chest covered in tattoos.

                         GUNT
          Well, I say bring him on. You see this
          ink? That's a hundred hours under the
          needle. A motherfucking canvas of pain.
          He and Chester here, we're not afraid of
          fuck-diddly!

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          The Gargoyle passes the doorway, lights up a smoke. Or tries
          to. The flame from his Zippo is bending sideways. He tries
          a couple more times. Same thing. Weird.

                         ON BLAZE
          hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to contain himself. If
          the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him.
          The Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an OPEN WINDOW
          nearby. He shuts it, lights his cigarette, turns back -- b=
          Blaze has moved on.

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Arlo settles back in his chair.

                         ARLO
          If this guy's as lethal as you say he is,
          I want fifty for me, another fifty for the
          club. Only you can't let the boys know
          we're takin' a 50K rake off the top, see?

                         CARRIGAN
          How `bout sixty and I'll throw in a kilo
          of coke?

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Coke? That's like selling snow to
          Eskimos. You think I'm some kind of
          crack-smoking foolio or something?

           Arlo reaches into his shoulder-holster, whipping out a mean
          looking nickel-plated Colt 44 Anaconda.

                         ARLO
          Ninety, and not a nickel less, you
          fucking pillow-biter.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Blaze continues, agitated. Where the fuck is the kid? He
          looks through a doorway, SEES --

          TEN OR MORE
          brutish gargoyles drinking beer and cleaning their weapons.
          Blaze drops back. His snarling face contorts, starts to
          assume that awful skullish quality. The Ghost Rider wants
          out. mow. But Blaze fights, shoves it back down and deep.
          SOMETHING moves to Blaze's right -- a TINY WHITE FIGURE,
          lolling and flopping at the far end of the passage.

          EXT. QUARRY - COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Nomi slices through another fuel line, inadvertently drawing
           the attention of a Gargoyle who was taking a leak. He zips
           up his jeans, starts towards her --

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

           Carrigan grins, trying to calm the situation.

                          CARRIGAN
          E a sy, gentlemen. No need to get all
           truculent on me.

                         ARLO
          Truculent? You get that out of a
          Scrabble dictionary or something? What
          the fuck does "truculent" mean?
          (grabbing Carrigan by his shirt)
          I'll tell you what it means. It means

          FUCK YOU!

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Blaze stares, hypnotised, his face flickering from skull to
          flesh and back again. The tiny figure is Rain's SKELETON
          DOLL, held upright, unsteady, by some unseen force.

          THAT MOMENT, ELSEWHERE - RAIN'S FACE
          Extreme mental concentration. Temples pounding. Her eyes
          are fluttering, rolled to white.

          BACK TO BLAZE
          as he starts towards the toy skeleton. He's in agony now,
          each breath a cough of fire, each footstep igniting the
          floorboards. He SEES a storage room up ahead --

          INT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT

          Carrigan smiles, seemingly unruffled by the gun.

                         CARRIGAN
          Okay, alright -- how about seventy-five
          and we'll smoke the old peace pipe?

                         ARLO
          (cocking the Anaconda)
          How `bout eighty or you're gonna be
          smoking my dick?

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze enters, SEES Rain. He extends a hand to her -- and
          Odell steps out from behind the door where he'd been hiding,
          shotgun in hand.

                         BLAZE
          Shit.

          EXT. QUARRY - COMPOUND - NIGHT

          Nomi tries to fall back into the shadows, but it's too late.
          The Gargoyle has spotted her. He draws a Taurus pistol --

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - OFFICE - NIGHT

          -- and we hear a high-pitched BEEPING. Arlo turns.

                         ARLO
          What is that?

          (wrinkling his noise)
          Smells like somethin's burning.

          What-is this, fucking charades?! It's
          h,jM, you- ass-holes !

          EXT. QUARRY, COMPOUND - NIGHT

           A FIREBALL erupts from the back of the building. The milling
          Gargoyles spring into action.
           Nomi takes advantage of the distraction, STABS the Gargoyle
          nearest her in the thigh, bolts --

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Carrigan and the others race out into the corridor even as
          Odell rushes from the storage room, a WAVE OF FIRE on his
          heels.

          THE GHOST RIDER
          emerges seconds later, Rain cradled in the crook of his arm,
          safe in a cool bubble of air. She looks to Carrigan. The
          meaning in her gaze is implicit: "I told you so".

                         GARGOYLES
          appear from every direction. Guns BLAZE. Bullets turn-to
          slag, vaporizing as they enter the Ghost Rider's aura of
          hellfire.
          Rain drops from the Ghost Rider's arm, runs. The Ghost Rider
          advances. The Gargoyle nearest him empties a machine pistol
          into the Ghost Rider. The Ghost Rider reaches for the
          weapon. At his touch, the pistol becomes RED HOT --
          The Gargoyle CRIES OUT. The Ghost Rider takes the pistol, and
          FIRES BACK. The Gargoyles stumble, clawing at their smoking
          wounds. In seconds, the entire weapon turns WHITE HOT, melting
          apart in the demon's hand, SIZZLING away into nothing --
          The Ghost Rider keeps coming. Men are SMASHED aside,
          incinerated. Bravado turns to terror, to chaotic scramble --

          EXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          FLAMES belch from every window. Panic-stricken Gargoyles try
          to start their bikes -- and the bikes detonate. one after the
          other!
          CRASH! Nomi's pickup barrels through the fence. She slaloms
          through a gauntlet of flames, skidding to a halt. She SEES
          Rain running towards her, throws open the passenger door --

                         NOMI

          RAIN! "
          Rain makes for the pickup, scrambles inside even as --

          THE GHOST RIDER
          strides from the burning ruins of the compound. With a wave
          of his hand, the wall of flame parts like the Red Sea. He
          locks his gaze with Nomi, points a skeletal finger at her.
          His meaning is clear: "You are on the list."
          Nomi floors the gas. The pickup slews and grinds, finds
          purchase, leaps away from the monster as --

          THE PULSIFER BROTHERS
          emerge from the building, burned but howling for blood,
          fueled by a lethal combination of stupidity and crystal mech.
          Carrigan, Landsdale, and Arlo fall in behind.
          The Ghost Rider moves, whipping his red hot chains. Left, he
          lassos a passing gargoyle, BURNS him. Right, another
          Gargoyle, dragged from his bike and reduced to ash.
          Then two more lashes to either side of the brothers. Two
          more victims reeled in -- charred corpses falling at the
          Ghost Rider's feet. The whole thing took three seconds.

                         CHESTER
          (to Gunt, nerves failing)
          Forget it, bro, live to fight another day.
          The Ghost Rider slams his skeletal hand on the tank of a
          nearby bike. The bike glows RED HOT and CHANGES SHAPE,
          getting bigger, nastier, demonically slouched --

                         GUNT
          No fucking way! That's my hog!
          As the Ghost Rider mounts the newly transformed hellcycle,
          Gunt charges forward, infuriated. He OPENS FIRE with his
          mini-â¢un, .er. rounds a second.

                         CONTINUED:
          Moving with uncanny speed, the Ghost Rider grips Gunt by the
          throat and hauls him off his feet, unleashing the full fury
          of his Penance Stare.

          A BLAST-WAVE OF LIGHT
          erupts from the Ghost Rider's eye sockets, engulfing Gunt.
          Gunt SHRIEKS, his cries becoming infant-like ULULATIONS.
          Arlo, Carrigan, Chester, and the others instinctively shield
          their faces, falling back from the infernal glow --

                         CHESTER
          Gunt!

          ON GUNT,
          images from his own subjective hell assault him. Tears
          stream down his cheeks as his body ignites. His corneas are
          burning, melting.
          The Ghost Rider starts to accelerate now, from zero to sixty
          in an eye-blink, hauling Gunt's writhing body along with him
          - straight into the burning building.

          INT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT

          A juggernaut trajectory crashing through wall after blazing
          wall. The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, HURLS Gunt to the
          floor. Senses SOMEONE behind him --

          A FIRE EXTINGUISHER,
          blasting the Ghost Rider's head. The Ghost Rider SQUEALS
          and for a split-second, the demon's flames are actually
          snuffed out. The cloud clears. The Ghost Rider glimpses

                         ODELL
          rushing into another room, SLAMMING a steel door behind.

          INT. QUARRY - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

          Odell pauses in the darkness, hyperventilating. Outside, we
          hear the heavy FOOTFALLS of the Ghost Rider approaching.

          INT. QUARRY - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          The Ghost Rider places a skeletal hand against the steel
          door. His hand GLOWS WHITE HOT, like an acetylene torch.
          The steel door begins to bubble and melt.

          INT. QUARRY - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

          The door to the storage room liquefies, flowing apart like
          molten lava. The Ghost Rider steps through and --
          -- in the light cast by .he demon's owing hand. Odell
           realizes that the room is stacked with high explosives.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Nomi's pickup races into the night. A distant FIREBALL
          ERUPTS hugely, engulfing the quarry, setting off a chain
          reaction of smaller explosions -- BA-BOOM-BOOM-B-B-BOOOOM!

          EXT/INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - NIGHT

          Rain clutches at Nomi, frantic, looking back.

                         RAIN
          What about the Ghost Rider? We have to
          go back for him!

                         NOMI
          Are you crazy?! Sit down!
          Then Nomi glances in the rearview mirror. Oh. My. God.

          THE GHOST RIDER
          is coming after them. HOWLING, plowing through the inferno
          on his hellcycle.
          Nomi floors the gas. But the pickup is already maxed out.
          The Ghost Rider easily gains on the truck, leaving a wake of
          burning asphalt. He lashes out with his chains, snags the
          back bumper. The chain-links slice deep into the steel
          bodywork. The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel --
          Nomi slams on the brakes. The truck fishtails. The Ghost
          Rider rear-ends the pickup. Bike and demon cartwheel crazily
          into the cargo bed, SLAMMING explosively against the back
          window of the cab. Hot glass showers Nomi and Rain --
          The Ghost Rider is pinned, SQUEALING, entangled with his bike.
          Nomi floors it again. The truck leaps ahead --
          -- but the Ghost Rider hangs on as his bike slides backwards.
          He reaches into the cab, clutching at Nomi. The pickup
          thunders up a rise --

          The Ghost Rider's skeletal fingers clamp Nomi's shoulder.
          She HOWLS in pain, her clothing beginning to smoke. Rain
          tries to help, imploring --

          No, no, no --

          EXT/INT. NOMI'S PICKUP - DAY

          The truck makes the rise -- and there's THE SUN, dawning huge
          and white. flaring mightily over the distant horizon.

          THE GHOST RIDER
          recoils, blinded by the dawn. He releases Nomi, collapses
          backwards. His fire extinguishes, his skull-face fades --
          -- and Blaze lies in the pickup bed, shaking. Nomi glances
          back through the shattered cab window, her face a mask of
          fear and sympathy. Blaze looks to Gunt's bike, which has
          also reverted to its original state, then SEES --

                         BLAZE'S POV:
          The bad guys coming on battered bikes -- Arlo, Chester, plus
          FOUR OTHER GARGOYLES. And bringing up the rear, a seven ton
          Mack dumper driven by Carrigan. Landsdale rides shotgun.
          Blaze looks to Nomi, SHOUTS over the wind:

                         BLAZE
          Give me your gun!
          Nomi passes it back. The Gargoyles OPEN FIRE. Bullets zing
          and whine. Blaze shoves Gunt's cycle off the pickup bed
          The heavy wreck CRASHES and bounces, wasting the first
          Gargoyle. The others swerve around the sliding debris

          EXT. INTERSECTION/HIGHWAY - DAY

          Nomi runs a stops sign, slews across a rural intersection,
          pounds the HORN, swerving to avoid the crossing cars --

          AN ONCOMING TANKER TRUCK
          brakes, jack-knifes. Four gargoyles make it past, the fifth
          is flattened. The Mack comes last, SMASHING a passing
          minivan into a spin --

          ANGLE ON A GAS STATION
          A STATE TROOPER, hidden from view, hits his SIREN, gives

                         CHASE --

          BACK TO ARLO AND THE OTHER GARGOYLES
          Gaining, riddling the pickup with BULLETS. Blaze is pinned
          in the bed, can't get off a shot --

          ON CHESTER PULSIFER,
          hanging back and riding one-handed. He hefts a 66mm LAWs
          rocket on his shoulder, LAUNCHES it --
          Near miss. But the impact lifts the pickup's rear axle into
          the air. Nomi SCREAMS. Blaze hangs on for dear life.

          ON CARRIGAN,
          hauling the Mack alongside Chester --

                         CARRIGAN

          Chester aims the launcher again. Carrigan swerves, CRUSHES
          Chester under the Mack's mighty wheels.

          THE TROOPER CAR
          pulls alongside the Mack, SIREN wailing. Carrigan veers
          hard, forcing it into the opposing lane. Up ahead:
          ROADWORKS. The highway narrows to a single lane --

          BACK TO ARLO AND THE GARGOYLES
          Gaining on the pickup, trading shots with Blaze at ninety
          miles and hour.
          Blaze wings one Gargoyle, then plugs another who loses
          control, cartwheels catastrophically, EXPLODES --
           Arlo zigzags the debris, guns his hog, screams closer. Blaze
          fires but -- CLICK, CLICK, CLICK -- he's out!

          tar cooker, spins spumes of molten tar in all directions.
          HIGHWAY WORKERS run for their lives.
          Nomi SMASHES through barricades, leaps a pile of rough
          gravel. Blaze is nearly hurled out the bed, but hangs on,
          shoulder screaming --

          A FOREGROUND WORKER
          operating a jackhammer fails to notice the careening pickup
          racing by, which-is, in turn, followed by Arlo and --

           Arlo rides against Nomi's door, lets rip with his Uzi. Glass
          SHATTERS. Rain and Nomi duck --
          Arlo tries again, sticks his Uzi right into the cab. But
          Nomi forces the gun upwards. Bullets puncture the roof,
          shell casings ricochet-
          In desperation, Nomi reaches for the door latch, kicks her
          foot against the door. The door swings outward, taking Arlo
          along with it.

                         UP AHEAD
          is a concrete divider. Nomi abruptly veers right, clipping

          hauling himself back into the pickup bed even as --

                         THE MACK
          bears down on them. Landsdale jumps from the cab, landing
          alongside Blaze. The two men struggle in the cargo bed, hand
          to hand, exchanging a volley of vicious blows.
          Nomi is desperate, doesn't know what to do. Landsdalp is
          getting the upper hand. He grips Blaze by the throat,
          forcing him over the side of the pickup bed, shoving Blaze's
          head towards the churning wheels of the Mack --

          CRIES OUT, makes a forceful hand gesture --

          pouring from his eyes. Blaze rolls, throws Landsdale over
          his shoulder -- into the wheels of the Mack.

          UP AHEAD, A MASSIVE ROADBLOCK
          Barricades, bulldozers, dozens of state police cars.
          The pickup and the Mack pass over a line of TIRE SPIKES. The

          Hold on to something!
          She brakes. The pickup fishtails. Carrigan also brakes,

          The rolling Mack plows into the roadblock, seven tons of iron
          crushing cruisers and barricades alike.

          Nomi falling out of the cab, finding Rain, unhurt, alive.

          chained, cuffed, struggling with TWO DEPUTIES trying to drag
          him to a cell. Further up, Carrigan is being similarly
          escorted. Blaze looks to the faces of his fellow prisoners,
          dread seizing his body.

                         BLAZE
          I have to talk to the warden. You have
          to put me someplace else --

                         DEPUTY #1
          Should've thought of that before you
          pulled that "Dukes of Hazzard" stunt.

                         BLAZE
          Please, just listen to me. Put me in
          solitary, anywhere but here.

                         DEPUTY #2
           This isn't a fucking hotel, chief.

                         BLAZE
           You don't understand, people will die --
           WHACK! A baton blow to the knee. Blaze CRIES OUT, staggers --

                         DEPUTY
          Easy on the threats, big guy --
          (shouts to door control)

          NUMBER TEN!
          The cell door opens. Blaze struggles even more violently now.

                         BLAZE
          Do not put me in here! Do not leave me
          with these men! They'll die if you do
          this!! !
          The deputies force Blaze inside, using batons, boots. A stun
          gun SPARKS. Blaze falls. The cell door SLAMS. The inmates
          opposite are LAUGHING, waving, bashing their bars with every
          metal implement they've got as we --

          EXT. MOTEL - DAY

          A grimy, little stop, held together with paint. Nomi and
          Rain step off a bus, each carrying a bag of supplies.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Simple and clean. Rain locks the door, goes to the window
          and opens it wide -- a beautiful day outside, hills rolling
          down to a busy town a mile distant.
          Nomi drops her bag, sits wearily on the bed, peels her jacket
          open -- revealing a nasty shoulder wound. Burned to the
          bone, the impression of fingers clearly evident.
          Rain hurries to help, rummages antiseptics and bandages from
          Nomi's bag. Together, they clean the wound. Nomi's pain is
          clear, but she keeps it quiet.

                         RAIN
          Are we safe now?
          Nomi regards her sadly. She's never been one to tell lies.

                         NOMI
          Honey, I don't know if we'll ever be
          safe.
          Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about
          her look -- far too fatalistic for a child her age.

                         RAIN
          He talks to me sometimes.

                         NOMI

          What does he say?
          Rain starts to cry now, suddenly overwhelmed. Despite her
          eerily calm demeanor, she's still a child. And a frightened
          one at that.

                         RAIN
          I don't want to be like him, mom.

          Nomi hugs her, desperate, as if the world were ending.

          On Carrigan, in his cell at the end of the corridor. He's
          nervous, cutting a deck of cards.

          Nomi quietly closes the door. Walks to the far end where the

          Nomi back on the bed, ODing. The SHADOW of Starke falling

          Blaze suddenly CRIES OUT, throwing himself onto the floor.

          The Ghost Rider stands in the center of Blaze's cell, a
          cyclone of hellfire swirling around him -- for there is a
          direct, casual relationship between the amplitude of his rage
          and the number of transgressors in its vicinity.
          He moves forward, melting the cell bars, stepping into --

          THE CORRIDOR BEYOND
          The prisoners are frantic, leaping about like frightened lab
          animals.
          THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost Rider's heavy FOOTFALLS ring out as
          it strides down the corridor, turning his awful gaze on the
          first cell. The Ghost Rider extends a hand, sending a STREAM
          OF HELLFIRE coursing over the prisoner within.
          The Ghost Rider moves on, to the second and third cells,
          swiveling his gaze back and forth, BURNING the occupants
          within. Like shooting fish in a barrel.
          THOOM! THOOM! The Ghost Rider continues its rampage.
          Murderers, rapists, malefactors. Some curse, others plead,
          others simply drop to their knees and pray. For they know,
          instinctively, that the universe is not an arbitrary place,
          that their Day of Judgement has come.
          The entire jail is ablaze now, a roiling extension of the
          Ghost Rider's fury, drowning out the VOICES OF THE DAMNED.

          ON THE FINAL CELL

          melt, flowing to the floor like liquid. He stares down at
          Carrigan, his hollow eve sockets sparking to life.

          AS THE PENANCE STARE
          erupts from the Ghost Rider's eyes, Carrigan reaches for
          something beneath the bed --
          cell wall. He holds it up.
          The effect is catastrophic, like the Medusa having her own
          deadly gaze turned back upon her. The Ghost Rider stumbles
          backwards, SHRIEKING, assaulted by an onslaught of subjective
          images. Visions horrifying enough to drive even a demon mad.

          EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- NIGHT

          The windows of the jail pulse with HELLFIRE, panes of safety

           the onrush that much more unbearable. We INTERCUT --

          radiant at the beach. Flickering sunshine makes her squint.

          Fuck it. He presses the barrel against his forehead.
          Squeezes his eyes tightly shut, compresses the trigger --
          -- but he can't do it. He lowers the gun, weeping with
          frustration and -- freezes, head cocked like he heard a

          My mother is dead.

          Rain looks down at Blaze's hand -- the gun resting there.
          Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed.
          The wind picks up. Rain looks to the graves.

          RAIN (CONT' D)
          What do you think happens when you die?
          Do you think there's a heaven?

                         BLAZE
          I don't know.

                         (INSISTENT)
          But what do you think?
          Blaze studies Rain. This kid is hurting. What she needs
          now, is reassurance. And try as he might, Blaze just can' t
          seem to harden his heart against her.

                         BLAZE
          Yeah, I think there's something. Maybe
          not angels playing harps and stuff, but

                         (SEARCHING)
          -- something.
          Rain wipes her nose with her sleeve, wanting to believe it.

                         RAIN
          He'll keep coming, you know. Unless you
          stop him.

                         BLAZE

                         (TIRED)
          I don't know that I can anymore.

                         RAIN
          But you'll try, right?
          Blaze regards her curiously. Even in grief, she's a
          consummate negotiator.

                         BLAZE
          I don't have anything left to give, kid.
          Blaze stands, starts walking. Rain follows.

                         RAIN
          My mother said you were a good man.

                         BLAZE
          I'm not.

                         RAIN
          She said I could trust you.

                         BLAZE
          You can't.

                         RAIN

                         (PERSISTENT)
          But don't you think there's a reason why
          all of this is happening? Like fate?

                         RAIN
          Maybe it believes in you.
          Blaze stops. Cold. Deja-vu all over again. He looks back
          at Rain. Sighs.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY - DAY

          A battered truck full of MIGRANT FARM-WORKERS grinds to a
          halt. Blaze and rain jump out in a cloud of dust.

                         DRIVER

                         (POINTING)
          Alla! Mision de Sante Lupia!
          High up the mountain: an old adobe building perched on
          stilts, precariously overhung. On top of its bell tower, a
          crucifix stands clear and proud.

                         RAIN
          We're going to a church?

                         BLAZE
          It's not a church. It's a mission. They
          take people in.
          Blaze pays the driver. The truck roars away. Rain looks
          back to the mission, doubtful.

                         RAIN
          Are you going to dump me there?

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE MISSION - DAY

          18th Century Spanish adobe. Chapel and dormitory, currently
          under renovation. VARIOUS TOUGH-LOOKING MEN are at work.
          Picks and hoes clink in the dirt.
          Blaze and Rain make their way towards the main building.
          TOLBEIN (40s, hard, mistrustful) intercepts them.

                         TOLBEIN

                         BLAZE
          Our car broke down a few miles back and
          my daughter and I were wondering if we
          could crash here for the night.
          Tolbein sizes them up -- doesn't like what he sees.

                         TOLBEIN
          Don't think so.

                         BLAZE
          What about a ride, then? Is there a town
          somewhere you could take us to?
          Other men have gathered behind Tolbein -- VISCOTT, WILSON.
          One of them, NUNEZ, nods to the South.

                         NUNEZ
          Why don't you head back to Dawson? They
          got motels there.

                         BLAZE
          That's not really an option.

                         TOLBEIN
          Then I'd say you're out of luck.

                         BLAZE
          Look, you must have a cot, something. The
          kid's hungry --

           RHYMER (O.S. )
          I'm sure we can figure something out.
          JOE RHYMER, 50s, approaches, silences Tolbein with a look.
          He's down to earth, capable, wearing a black shirt, cleric's
          collar, oily jeans, and muddy work boots.

                         RHYMER (CONT'D)
          (offering his hand)
          Joe Rhymer. I'm the Padre.

                         BLAZE
          This is Rain.

                         RHYMER
          Rain? That's a pretty name.

                         (TO RAIN)
          You hungry, Rain? Would you like
          something to eat?
          Rain nods. Rhymer ushers them inside. As he moves to
          follow, Tolbein stops him.

          Bottom line, Father. There's something
          wrong with those two. Especially the
          kid.

                         RHYMER
          Duly noted, Richard.

                         (POINTEDLY)
          And overruled.

          ANGLE ON A RAGGEDY FIGURE
          jutting into frame in the foreground. Blaze pauses at the
          threshold of the chapel, looks back, uneasy -- but it's just
          a SCARECROW being buffeted about by the wind.

          INT. MISSION - CHAPEL - DAY

          Rhymer leads Blaze down the central aisle. The chapel is
          dark, lit by candle-light, crowded with scaffolding and drop-
          sheets. As Blaze walks, the flames of the candles bend in
          his direction -- as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force.

                         BLAZE
          Those men outside --

                         RHYMER
          Most of them are on a work-release
          program. We're a halfway house for ex-
          offenders. We try to get people on their
          feet, reintegrate them into society.
          Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive.

                          RHYMER (CONT'D)
           (misreading Blaze's look)
           Don't worry, you're perfectly safe here.
           But of course, that's not what Blaze is thinking.

          INT. MISSION - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

          Rain sits at the table, spooning her soup. Tolbein, Nunez
          and a few others watch them. Blaze watches them back,
          nonchalant in the face of their obvious hostility.

          EXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

          BUILDERS working. Men carrying provisions. There's a small
          vegetable garden in the center of the courtyard. Rain helps
          the GARDENER pull carrots.

          Blaze watches from a distance, cleaned up, clothes laundered--
          Rhymer approaches, gestures to the garden.

                         RHYMER
          It's turned out beautiful, hasn't it? We
          try to be as self sufficient as we can,
          back to the earth and all that.
          He notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun.

                         RHYMER (CONT'D)
          You any good with diesel engines?

                         BLAZE
          I know my way around a flywheel housing.

                         RHYMER
          Well I've got a generator out back that's
          been on life support the last few weeks.
          Mind helping me try to resuscitate it?
          Blaze looks at him curiously.

                         BLAZE
          Sure.

          INT. BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Blaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old
          generator. There are a number of vehicles stored around
          them, including a pair of dusty motorcycles.

                         RHYMER
          So how long have you been running?

                         BLAZE
          What do you mean?

                         RHYMER
          You know what I mean. You spend as much
          time around lost souls as I have, you
          learn how to read a man's face.

                         (NODDING)
          You want to hand me that crescent wrench?
          Blaze hands Rhymer the wrench, who then makes an adjustment.

                         RHYMER (CONT'D)
          Take the girl, for instance. She's not
          your daughter, is she?

          She's dead.

          Did you kill her?

          No.
          Rhymer studies Blaze, decides he believes him.

          BLAZE (CONT' D)

                         (ELABORATING)
          She doesn't have anyone else. I'm just
          trying to protect her.

                         RHYMER
          And who's protecting you?

          MOMENTS LATER,
          Blaze and Rhymer are cleaning up.

                         BLAZE
          Listen, I appreciate what you're trying
          to do, but I've never really been a come
          to Jesus kind of guy.

                         RHYMER
          I wasn't talking about Jesus, I was
          talking about a little healthy
          introspection. Working here, staying in
          one place for a while, seeing what
          surfaces. I've found that people tend to
          arrive on our doorstep for a reason.
          Blaze considers this formidable man, a yearning moment
          then he shakes his head.

                         BLAZE
          I can't stay. I'm sorry.

                         RHYMER
          What about the girl, then? Whatever
          you're involved in, I can't imagine it's
          good for her well-being.
          (beat, gentle)
          We can find a home for her.

           I'd have to leave tonight --
           Rhymer nods, understanding, he motions towards a beautiful
           motorcycle parked back in the shadows -- a `71 Norton
          Commando 850. Black, with gold pin-striping.

                         RHYMER
          You can take the Norton.

                         BLAZE
          I don't have any money.

                         RHYMER
          So send us some when you do.
          Blaze is moved by this man's simple humanity -- but he's also
          wrestling with the idea of abandoning Rain.

          EXT. MISSION - DUSK/NIGHT

          TIME-LAPSING SHADOWS cross the mission buildings and the
          surrounding wilderness landscape. The lonely scarecrow
          stares button-eyed and blank.

          INT. MISSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze gazes into a bathroom mirror. Been here so many times
          before. SOUNDS intrude upon his solitude.
          He bows his head, studies the coin, turning it over in his
          shaking fingers. The malicious coyote, the soaring eagle.
          Still the SOUNDS come, stronger, more insistent --
          Cars CRASHING. Police SIRENS wailing. SCREAMS. GUNFIRE.

          FLAMES.
          Blaze looks up once more. His eyes are shadowed sockets.
          This is the real PENANCE STARE, and Blaze is feeling its
          awful, mournful ache.

                         NOMI'S VOICE
          He wants to know if you're a bad man.
          He wants to know -- if the Ghost Rider
          turned its penance stare on you, would
          you burn?
          Blaze clenches his fist around the coin, spins on his heels.

          INT. MISSION - DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Blaze pauses in the doorway, looking in on Rain, who sleeps,
          dead to the world. Blaze sets the coyote coin on the bed
          table next to her, turns and leaves.
          We HOLD ON Rain's sleeping face for a beat, then she stirs,
          opening her eyes. She SEES the coin nearby, sits up.

          INT. MISSION - STORM CELLAR - NIGHT

          The Norton Commando ROARS into life, blasting webs from the
          exhaust. Blaze guides the bike up the coal ramp and out
          through the open cellar doors.

          EXT. MISSION - NIGHT

          A STORM FRONT is moving in, huge thunderheads gathering and
          roiling. Blaze pulls a dusty skid, pauses with the engine
          RUMBLING. Looks back forlornly at the mission. Then he
          wrings the throttle and hauls away into the night as we --

          ANGLE ON A DORM ROOM WINDOW

          rising outside, gathering in strength.

                         RHYMER
          That which was from the beginning, which
          we have heard, which we have seen with
          our eyes, which we have looked upon, and
          our hands have handled, of the Word of
          life."

          INT. MISSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          MOVING WITH Rain down a moonlit corridor- She clutches the
          coyote coin like a talisman, then ---

                         SEES SOMETHING

          it's just the scarecrow out in the field, flapping wildly.

          UP AHEAD,
          the land falls sharply away, spilling down into a wide
          expanse of moonlit ocean pregnant with the promise of

          Rhymer and his men eat. Rain is there too. Nunez peers out
          into the darkness. Wind and debris are scratching at the
          window panes. We hear THUNDER now, too.

                         NUNEZ
          Padre. You'd better take a look at this.
          Rhymer joins him. SEES what he SEES: COYOTES gathering. Six
          or more. They creep malevolently towards the mission.

                         NUNEZ (CONT'D)

          She's acutely conscious of the men staring at her now, still
          clutching the coin like a rabbit's foot.

                         TOLBEIN
          It's her -- she's the one doing this.

                         RHYMER
          That's enough, Richard.

                         TOLBEIN
          I'm telling you, Father, there's
          something wrong with --
          CRASH! One of the windows SLAMS open, startling everyone.
          Rhymer moves to it, latches it shut again.

          INT. MISSION - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

          LIGHTNING flashes. An eerie HOWLING arises. Tolbein and
          Nunez lead some men to the front door. Tolbein unbars the
          door, pulls it open, can't believe his eyes: THREE DOZEN
          HOWLING COYOTES, approaching the entrance.

                         TOLBEIN
          What is this?!
           SCARE! A snarling coyote comes out of left field, just
          misses his throat --
           Tolbein leaps backward, SLAMS the door. The men start
           SHOUTING. Rain backs away. She knows what's happening.
           WHAM! An animal rams the door. Then another. And another --

          INT. MISSION - RHYMER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Rhymer breaks out a shotgun, shells, hears the men SHOUTING.

          INT. MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rhymer rushes in. The men are confused, afraid. WHAM!
          WHAM! GROWLING coyotes are hurling themselves repeatedly
          against the windows, cracking the panes.

                         RHYMER
          Get away from the windows!

                         (TO WILSON)

          I ain't going nowhere with her.
          All the men are giving Rain a wide berth now. WHAM! Another
          snarling coyote hits the glass.

                         RHYMER
          One of you, please, just take the kid to
          the chapel.

                         TOLBEIN
          Father, that's the last place she should
          be.
          CRUNCH! Something strikes the room a massive blow.
          Something MUCH BIGGER than a coyote. Viscott starts praying.

                         NUNEZ
          Quiet, Viscott!
          THUMP! CRUMP! More heavy blows. Like the Fist of God.
          Making the floorboards beneath their feet vibrate. SOMETHING
          shambles past the window. What in God's name was that?

                         TOLBEIN
          (looking at Rain, accusing)
          I knEw we should've sent them away!
          THOOM! Another impact. THOOM!THOOM! Plaster cracks. Dust
          falls. Viscott wails, praying even more stridently. Nunez
          is losing it_

                         NUNEZ

          SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN!

          She's the one they want, I'm telling you!
          -- and the lights abruptly go ou The storm bellows and
           blusters. The men huddle together, fear thick and sour.

           CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          Raainn -- Raaaaiinnn --

           (to Rhymer, hissing)
          I told you --
          Even Rhymer is shaken now. He moves to investigate, presses
          up against a cracked window --

          RHYMER'S POV (THROUGH WINDOW)
          Carrigan stands outside, lurching between patterns of
          moonlight and shadow. But the movement is all wrong. And in
          our momentary glimpses of him, we get the sense that he's
          been horribly changed -- as if his body had been torn apart,
          then haphazardly reassembled into something else.
          CRUNCH! The wall fractures. Rhymer staggers back. WHUMP!
          CRUNCH! A row of impacts moves along the wall --
          Tolbein and Nunez scramble to reach the dining room door.
          They close it, turning the locks.
          WHANG! Carrigan slams against the other side of the heavy,
          steel door. WHANG!WHANG! Again and again and again. The
          men are terrified, SHOUTING at each other. The door is
          buckling inward, the hinges bending and GROANING --
          Then the pummelling stops. Just the sound of BREATHING,
          halting and phlegmatic. No one moves, not a whisper.
          CORROSION starts to spread across the metal door.

                         NUNEZ
          What the fuck --?!
           Rhymer edges close to the decaying door, peering through a gap
          in the frame --
          Carrigan peers back, moonlight illuminating his face. There
          are buttons where his eyes should 12P. He BELLOWS:

                         CARRIGAN

          PRIEST! GIVE ME THE GIRL!
          The POUNDING begins anew, harder now. The weakened door is
          surely about to give way. Rain is terrified.

                         TOLBEIN
          Do what he says! Put her out!

                         RHYMER
          Get back with the others!

          We don't do what it says, that thing
          outside there's gonna kill us all.
          Rhymer steps in front of Rain, levels his shotgun at
          Tolbein's chest.

                         RHYMER
          God as my witness, Richard, lay a hand on
          that girl and I will pull this trigger.
          Tolbein hesitates -- then grabs at the shotgun. He twists it
          from Rhymer's hands, SMASHES the butt across Rhymer's jaw.
          Rhymer sinks to the floor.
          Tolbein grabs Rain, drags her SCREAMING to the door. He
          waves the shotgun at the others --

                         TOLBEIN
          Open the fucking door! DO IT!
          Nunez fumbles with the lock. Rhymer recovers, throws himself
          at Nunez, tries stop him from opening it. The pounding
          ceases. All eyes sweep to the door --

                         TWO BUTTONS
          roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the
          floor, coming to rest at Rhymer's feet -- immediately oottina
          the floorboards beneath them.

          CARRIGAN (O.S.)
          (a skin-crawling whisper)
          I can see you, Priest. I can see every
          last one of you.

          THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN,
          knocking Tolbein, Rain, Rhymer and Nunez on their asses. All
          eyes bug as Carrigan shoulders his way inside. Only he's n..t
          Carrigan anymore. Now he's --

                         THE SCARECROW
          A golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and
          sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and razor wire.
          Button-socket eyes. Jagged bone teeth. Beetle-black chitin
          for fingers and nails.
          His very existence is an affront to nature. Everything the
          Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays. Floorboards
          rot, metal rusts. Every movement, every spastic shudder and
          twitch is a source of incalculable pain.

          The Scarecrow thrusts his hand out and a STORM OF DEMONIC
          CROWS explodes from his chest, whirling about like a cyclone
          of knives.
          Now the coyotes enter too. Dozens of them, SNARLING, DIVING
          at the men, sinking their jaws into flesh.
           The men are trapped. Some try to flee. Others fight back,
          swinging chairs and planks --

                         THE SCARECROW
          stalks into their midst, snaring victims left and right,
          HURLING bodies or pulling them apart --
          He snatches Viscott up by his throat. Bugs swarm over the
          SCREAMING parolee's face as it rots and decays. In seconds,
          Viscott's entire body decomposes, putrefies, falls apart --

          RHYMER AND RAIN
          back up towards the kitchen. SCREECH! A crow-thing comes
          flapping. Rhymer FIRES. The creature SHRIEKS and flops --
          Nunez claws another from his face, SEES it's not a crow at
          all, but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a
          deformed razor beak, matted feathers, bony talons --
          Wilson, trapped under a bench, BEATS desperately at a
          gnashing coyote. Lands a real blow. The beast falls back
          then stands up like a man?

                         VARIOUS ANGLES
          as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise. The coyotes are changing
          shape, enlarging, canine skeletons CRACKING and re-arranging
          themselves into --

                         JAW-BEASTS
          The same half-glimpsed horrors we glimpsed accompanying
          Starke. All muscle and gnashing fangs and bloody, ripping
          claws.

          Blaze rolls the Norton to a stop. Kills the engine. Sits
          back in the saddle and drinks in the night.
          The moonlit landscape is profoundly silent, the starry sky
          clear and awesome. Nothing stirs.

                         BLAZE'S POV
          Distant thunderheads. LIGHTNING flickering.
          CLOSE ON Blaze, trying to drive Rain from his mind. We can
          SEE on his face that it's a losing battle -- for poor, cursed
          Johnny Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth.

          INT. MISSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Claws and jaws and razor-beaks tearing frenziedly through
          wood and plaster and lathe. Rhymer, Rain, Nunez and Tolbein
          struggle to repel the monsters, beating them back with
          whatever is at hand --
          -- but the jaw-beasts and razor birds are winning, forcing
          their way into the kitchen --
          Nunz is snagged. Slashing claws swarm all over him. The
          others try to pull him free --
          Rhymer wastes two more precious SHOTS, but Nunez is lost.
          Dragged SCREAMING into the storm of mouths and claws. The
          survivors fall back as the door gives and --

                         THE SCARECROW
          pitches through the opening, lurching forward. Jaw-beasts
          fall in behind him. Razor birds whirl around his head.
          The survivors scramble for the far exit. Rain opens every
          gas burner on the grill as she passes by -- but the far exit
          is locked. And Rhymer doesn't have the key!
          BOOM! Rhymer shotguns the lock! The lock fractures, but the
          exit still won't open. Tolbein starts kicking. Rhymer aims

          reels. Burning jaw-beasts writhe and howl.

           Blaze. Coming back. Ninety_ One hundred. Wind tears
           wildly at his hair, jacket. The bike shudders. The
          tachometer edges upwards --
          One twenty. One twenty-five. Nitrous booster. The Norton
          SCREAMS. One thirty. One forty. One fifty --
          HEAT streams off Blaze. FLAMES wisp from his nostrils. One
          sixty. One seventy.
          The tachometer SHATTERS. The engine smokes. The bike
          SHRIEKS, pushing the edge of mechanical reason.
          FLAMES explode from Blaze's mouth and eyes. His hands
          ignite. He CRIES OUT in agony. His body alters violently.
          His face warps. Bones crack and shift. Flesh shrinks and
          tightens as the skull-visage emerges.
          The bike changes too, red heat spreading throughout.
          Tortured metal SCREECHES. Straining machinery pops and
          bulges. Shafts lengthen into skeletal "bones". The saddle
          slouches. The tank distends --
          WHOOMPF! The wheels ignite, then the whole bike. HELLFIRE
          streams, an extension of Blaze's rage.
          Blaze SCREAMS from the pit of his soul as the Ghost Rider
          claws itself into being, more manifest that ever before --

          -- the Scarecrow, savagely burnt by the blast, but
          unstoppable. He rises, cocks his head, hears something --

          VARIOUS ANGLES - DINING ROOM, KITCHEN, STAIRCASE
          The jaw-beasts_ The razor birds. All pause. All listen.
          They know something's coming. Something fast. Something bad.
          We hear it now too -- the WHINE of an APPROACHING ENGINE.

          ON THE COYOTE COIN
          wobbling to a stop, coyote side up.
          Realizing what's about to happen, the Scarecrow lets loose a
          GHASTLY WAIL and --

          THE GHOST RIDER
          erupts through the wall in DEEP SLOW MOTION, sending forth a
          majestic tsunami of fire and debris. The monster bike skids,
          carves floorboards like matchwood --

          JAW-BEASTS AND RAZOR BIRDS
          hurl themselves out of its scorching path --
          The Ghost Rider vaults from the saddle, sends the bike
          spinning at the scurrying monsters. It ninepins a few, takes
          out the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke --

                         THE CROW-THINGS
          are vanquished, squealing and flopping like living cinders.

          BUT THE JAW-BEASTS RECOVER,
          still aflame but very much alive. If anything, they seem
          emboldened by the fire. They circle the Ghost Rider, more
          and more of them joining the pack.

          THE GHOST RIDER

          horrors pouncing and GNASHING. The Ghost Rider takes them.-
          Chains, flames, sheer power and force --
          Spines snap. Lupine skulls burn. The Ghost Rider tears the
          monsters limb from limb. The room becomes the Seventh Circle
          of Hell, and at the heart of the Inferno, the Ghost Rider
          exults in the slaughter --
          The whole mission is ablaze now, fire and churning smoke
          consuming everything in its path. Rhymer, Rain, and Tolbein
          run for their lives.

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          Rain, Rhymer and Tolbein are trapped. Fire has cut them off.
          They back their way towards the rear of the building, peer
          out the windows --

                         THEIR POV:
          a hundred foot drop straight down to the highway.

          There's no way down from here!
          CRACK! The door behind them splinters. The Scarecrow's
          found them once again.

          INT. MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          The Ghost Rider is having difficulty with the jaw-beasts.
          His fire burns them but they just keep coming -- blackened
          skeletal demons, possessed of an unstoppable ferocity --
          For every one he throws aside, two more seem to take its
          place. He can wound them, sear the flesh from their bones,
          but still they pile on, sinking their teeth into his skeletal
          flesh, CRUNCHING through his hollow rib-cage --
          The Ghost Rider SHRIEKS in pain, TEARS one from his back,
          SNAPS another's spine, PUNCHES a fist through a third's
          gnashing muzzle. He falls back through a doorway, onto --

                         A STAIRCASE
          And still, they attack. And now the Ghost Rider is
          weakening. He stumbles on the steps, falls to his knees.

          Summoning all his power, the Ghost Rider emits a SHOCKWAVE OF
          FLAME, a HEAT-BOMB that blasts the creatures clean off him.

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          The SHOCKWAVE shakes the room. FIRE belches through the
          splintered doorway --
          -- but the Scarecrow scarcely notices. He's flinging dorm
          beds left and right, HOWLING and GROANING as he hunts for --

                         RAIN
          huddled beneath a flimsy bed-frame.

                         SCARECROW

          RAAAAINNN! RAAINN!
          The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds Tolbein. He
          reaches for the man, sinking his spindly finger's into
           Tolbein's chest. Tolbein SCREAMS, instantly shrivelling,
          corroding into dust --
           The Scarecrow hurls aside yet another bed and finds --

                         RHYMER
          aiming his shotgun, point-blank range! BLAM! The BLAST
          Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrow's face.

          INT. MISSION - THE STAIRS - THAT MOMENT

          All Hell breaks loose. The Ghost Rider unleashes wave after
          wave of HELLFIRE, incinerating the hounds as they leap
          towards him, fighting his way up and up the steps --

          INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

          BLAM! Another BLAST chews apart the Scarecrow's neck. The
          monstrosity staggers, then lurches forward, grabbing the
          barrel of the shotgun, instantly corroding it --
          The wave of corrosion swarms up the stock while towards
          Rhymer's hands and he drops the gun, rolling away, scooping
          up Rain as he runs towards the bathroom --

          BACK TO THE SCARECROW,
          recovering, his makeshift flesh knitting itself back together.
          Flames kiss his body, causing sodden particles on his frame to
          SIZZLE and POP -- but because his decayed flesh is so wet, he
          never ignites.

                         THE BATHROOM
          A claustrophobic box of stalls and urinals. Rhymer and Rain
          are nowhere to be seen. Enraged, the Scarecrow tears into
           the stalls, ripping them aside one by one --

          The Scarecrow rends the last stall asunder, finds Rain and
          Rhymer cowering like bugs. He looms above Rain, beetle-
          fingers clutching, flashing a rotted rictus-grin --

                         RED-HOT CHAINS
          whip viciously around the Scarecrow's sodden head and torso.
          He's wrenched backwards, hauled out of the bathroom and
          SLAMMED across the dormitory into the opposite wall --

          The wall fractures. Debris falls, tumbling hundreds of feet
          down to the highway below.

          doorway to --

          THE GHOST RIDER
          At the other end of the chains. More accurately,

          GHOST BLAZE,
          battered and weakened, staggering. His flames are barely
          flickering, his bony flesh has become chalky and brittle.
          He's holding a jaw-beast skeleton, drops it to the floor --
          The Scarecrow attacks. Hand-to-hand combat. Massive blows
          and blocks. The burning room SHUDDERS with each impact --

          Ghost Blaze HOWLS, in agony as the Scarecrow's superior evil
          dominates. He feebly extends a hand towards the flames
          nearby, trying to compel the fire to him. The flames twist,
          briefly bend in his direction. The Ghost Rider HOWLS with
          frustration. He needs the flames. He will die without them.
          He tries again, reaching, reaching --

          Nuclear silence.
          An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch --
          An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom --
          Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now he's more than the
          Ghost Rider. He's a white-hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating
          with volcanic heat.
          And he DETONATES. An apocalyptic release that --

           It slows to a stop at the end of the drive, ENGINE RUMBLING.
           Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey.
           Blaze braces himself. A silent inhalation of breath. Rain

          The driver's door opens. A hulking silhouette steps out.

          -- and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame
          from within himself. He takes a long drag. In the pits of
          his eyes, something glows there -- a kind of lambent
          darkness.

                         BLAZE (CONT'D)
          -- but you'll have to go through me if
          you want her.
          Starke stares into Blaze's eyes. Doesn't like what he SEES.

                         STARKE
          Don't be a fool, Blaze. I'm offering you
          your life back.

                         BLAZE
          That's not a life. And least now one I'm
          interested in living.

                         STARKE
          You think you can control it. You can't.

                         BLAZE
          Guess I'm willing to take my chances.
          Starke nods, accepting defeat. For now. He looks down at
          Rain, a bitter smile creeping across his face --

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         STARKE
          You have your mother's eyes.
          -- and walks away.
          Blaze and Rain watch him retreat. Presently, a coyote slips
          from shadows, joining him on the road. It--lopes along beside
          him. We watch them disappear over a rise. Then they're
          gone.
          Beat. Rain studies Blaze, reaches for his hand.

                         RAIN
          He'll be back.

                         BLAZE
          Yeah.

          BACK AMONGST THE SMOKING RUINS
          We pass broken concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake
          constricting a mouse, an industry of beetles dissecting a
          bird's carcass. Finally, we come to a small, deep cavity --
          and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find --

          WOMAN (V.0.)
          And that's how it ended. With another
          beginning. A kind of balance struck
          between the flame and the fury.

                         BLAZE'S COIN
          balanced perfectly on it's edge. How it fell like that, at
          the heart of the wreckage, is a mystery that will probably
          never be solved.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          A NURSE brings a postcard to a sleeping patient's bedside.
          The patient is ROXANNE, sleeping peacefully, bathed in
          sunlight. The nurse tacks the card to a wall filled with
          many -- dozens and dozens of postcards charting Blaze's
          journey back and forth across the country.
          And we realize now, that Roxanne is the woman who has been
          narrating our tale.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CONTINUED:

          ROXANNE (V.O.)
          And me? I still sleep. Wandering.
          Waiting. Listening to the whispers of
          the dead.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY/NIGHT

          On Blaze, riding hard, as a scorching desert noon TIME-LAPSES
          into night.

          ROXANNE (V.O.)
          The world turns around without me. There
          are sharks. And there are doves. And
          nighttime holds far darker terrors than
          death. But I am never afraid because I
          know that he is out there, somewhere.
          And that someday, somehow --
          Blaze ignites, SCREAMS, hurls back his head --

          ROXANNE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          -- he will return to me.
          -- and the Ghost Rider rockets headlong into black.

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

				GREER
		I bet you did.

				MURPHY
		Candy?

				EPPS
		It's my pen name.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

				GREER
		Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

				MURPHY
		Red sky in morning, sailor take 
		warning.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
	under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS
			(lying)
		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

				MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
		Yeah.

				GREER
		There's a large vessel out about ten 
		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an 
		hour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
		raise it on the radio either. Makes 
		me think it might be in trouble.

				MURPHY
		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright 
	point of light in the middle of nowhere.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north.

	Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge 
	standing back.

				MURPHY
		This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner 
		two. Over.

	Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio 
	speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Merchant vessel at one seven four 
		one five west, five seven seven five 
		north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior 
		whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero 
		niner two. Over.

	Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on 
	the screen.

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be 
		doing up here? It's way out of the 
		lanes. There's not a port for 800 
		miles.

				DODGE
		Smugglers maybe.

				GREER
		Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

	A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

				MURPHY
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north, this is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Do you copy? Over.

	Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.

				GREER
		Call the Coastguard?

				MURPHY
		Steer to one eight five. Let's check 
		her out.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

	Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

				MURPHY
		How she got out here is one hell of 
		a good question.
			(a long beat, then)

	Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
	other end.

				GREER
		What is it?

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy.

	No answer.

		Sorry.

	Another beat in silence.

				GREER

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million 
		bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
		more. Could be a lot more.
			(a beat)
		What I'm proposing is... we split it 
		four ways.

	A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

				MURPHY
		Think about it. A million bucks a 
		piece.
			(a beat)
		You want to spend the rest of your

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally)
		Hit it!

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills 
	out of the anchor alley before Epps.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat 
	toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and 
	stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek 
	dangerously close to his face, until...

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor 
	alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A

		Dodge? You alright?

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

	Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down 
	into the water and come up again from the water to the tow 
	anchor on the tug's stern.

		More.

	The tug slows still more.

				MURPHY
		With a little extra fuel, weather

				DODGE
		Sounds reasonable.

		Hypothetically speaking, what if we

		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

		Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have 
		been lost at sea fifty years ago. 
		You don't think that's just a little 
		freaky?

				EPPS
		If this thing turns out to be a ship 
		everybody thought sank a long time 
		ago, we just hit the jackpot.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well how the hell you get 
		something like that wrong? That's a 
		damn big boat. It's either sunk or 
		it ain't.

				MURPHY
		We all want to get outa here, Dodge. 
		Especially me. With that boat in 
		tow. You got three days.  Make the 
		most of it.

	A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming 
	to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates 
	to Dubayy.

	Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows 
	the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz 
	into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as 
	he looks on at it.

	He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He 
	empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts 
	from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks 
	over the passenger manifest.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY

	Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last 
	night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of 
	the papers inside.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads 
	in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he 
	skins his knuckles.

				DODGE
		Fucker!

				GREER
		Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a 
		piece of metal.

				DODGE
			(inspecting his skinned 
			knuckles)
		Damn mind of it's own.

				GREER
			(seeing Murphy)
		Morning, skipper.

	Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.

				MURPHY
		Morning.

				GREER
		You're up late.

				MURPHY
		Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. 
		Where's Epps?

				DODGE
		Went aboard.

				MURPHY
		She take a radio?

				GREER
		Yeah.

	Murphy nods. A beat.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
	into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
	steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
	about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
	CAN BE HEARD.

	A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
	sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
	TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
	her, now silent.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door 
	where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through 
	it.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port 
	holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming 
	pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating 
	bizarre patterns.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs 
	there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie 
	on the floor.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

	INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment 
	circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine 
	ball.

	She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
	4' stack of gold ingots.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		What the fuck we gonna do with it?

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
		ours.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

				MURPHY
		The sooner we get under way, the 
		sooner we are to spending what's 
		ours.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum 
	fitting over one of the open turbines.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space 
	beyond the twisted hatch.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
			(as Epps stacks the 
			last one)
		Two twenty two.

	Greer makes a note.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty two kilograms of 
		solid gold.

				EPPS
		That's what I call a payday.

				GREER
		Hell yeah.

	They slap hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
	on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
	curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, this is 
		tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha 
		sierra bravo four zero niner two. 
		Radio check. Over.

	A moment, then:

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic 
		Warrior. This is United States 
		Coastguard Station North Island. 
		Your radio check is affirmative. 
		Over.

				MURPHY
		Roger that, North Island. Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over and out.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and 
	takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under 
	the stark light of a gas lantern.

				GREER
		Fifty million four ways. That's twelve 
		million and change a piece.  What 
		you gonna do with your share, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Not much at all, I guess. Retire.  
		Live out my golden years and all 
		that.

				DODGE
		I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.  
		Spend my time hauling rich Seattle 
		business men through the Puget.

				MURPHY
		How about you Epps?

				EPPS
		Guess I'll just keep working.

				DODGE
		What're you crazy?

				EPPS
		I like my job.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

				GREER
		Moving to Sweden.

				DODGE
		What's so great about Sweden?

				GREER
		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

				EPPS
		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder 
		the better.

				DODGE
		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish 
		girls you only gonna dream about.

				GREER
		We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
		doing if we don't get this boat 
		running.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

				MURPHY
		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

				GREER
		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.

		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Hard to say.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	No response.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner

		Chimera. Over.

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

			 THE END

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS

		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS

		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

		Yeah.

		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an

		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge 
	standing back.

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

		How she got out here is one hell of

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million 
		bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
		more. Could be a lot more.
			(a beat)
		What I'm proposing is... we split it 
		four ways.

	A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

				MURPHY
		Think about it. A million bucks a

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	AT THE PURSERS DESK

	Epps looks through a file cabinet behind a heavy wood counter 
	as Greer and Murphy approach.

				EPPS
		Everything's still here. Ticket 
		records, receipts, books of account.

	Greer picks one up.

				GREER
		One first class passage. Elizabeth 
		James. Dubayy to Halifax. January 
		29th 1953.

	Murphy takes it, looking it over.

				MURPHY
		Chimera. Flag ship of the Dobbins 
		Kirk Line. Nova Scotia.

	INT. CHIMERA - "B" DECK - DAY

	Murphy, Epps, and Greer top a staircase out onto a long, 
	darkened corridor. They move down. Some of the doors are 
	open, faint light from port holes showing small cabins with 
	beds, desks, a few chairs.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - FORWARD PASSAGE - DAY

	Murphy, Epps, and Greer come to a hatchway marked "BRIDGE."

	INT. CHIMERA - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before 
	them and the rusting foredeck about 150 feet below. Light 
	from the windows illuminates the bridge as Murphy, Greer and 
	Epps look around. Despite a little corrosion and a layer of 
	dirt, everything seems in its place.

				MURPHY
			(looking through 
			scattered charts and 
			papers)
		I'd sure like to get my hands on the 
		general log.

	Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.

				GREER
		That must be the old man right there.

	The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man 
	from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.

				EPPS
		Looks like one hell of a stick up 
		his ass.

				GREER
		He'd let you off at the nearest port, 
		that's for sure.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - NIGHT

	A dimming purple horizon is giving way to night as the tug 
	floats under the bow of the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

	Dodge works up to his elbows in turbine 1 as Greer monitors 
	a pressure gauge.

				DODGE
		How about now?

				GREER
		Sixty pounds.

				DODGE
		What? You sure?

				GREER
		That's what it says.

				DODGE
			(geting up to have a 
			look)
		Lemme see.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera 
	disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights.  
	Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

				EPPS
		Coffee?

				MURPHY
			(sitting up)
		Yeah. Thanks.

	She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back 
	from the Chimera.

				EPPS
			(taking a seat)
		What'd you find up there?

				MURPHY
		Some charts. A crew manifest.
			(looking them over)
		Looks like her last voyage was January 
		1953. The question is where the hell's 
		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane 
	hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.  
	Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

				MURPHY
		What's this?

				DODGE
		Turbine rotor's shot.

				MURPHY
		I thought you said it was just a 
		blade.

				DODGE
		Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace 
		the whole deal.

				MURPHY
		How much longer's that gonna take?

				DODGE
		Like I always say --

				MURPHY
		I know I know, two ways to do anything --

				DODGE
		The right way and the wrong way.

				MURPHY
		But how long?

				DODGE
		Hard to say.

				MURPHY
		We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A 
		storm blows up and we're history.

				DODGE
		I'm telling you, you don't want to 
		be running that fan like it is.

				MURPHY
		What about running number two by 
		itself?

				DODGE
		It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
		couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
		ice with it.

				MURPHY
		How long, then?

				DODGE
		I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
		everything in a new rotor -- .

				MURPHY
		How long?

				DODGE
		Three, four days.

				MURPHY
		Goddamit, Dodge.

				DODGE
		What do you want me to tell you, 
		that we can throw this sucker back 
		in and start pulling her like nothing 
		happened? Can't do it, skipper.

	A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right.

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (O.S RADIO)

	Murphy enters the pilothouse as the distance-warped VOICE 
	comes back on the radio.

	After a moment, the same professional, distance-warped voice 
	comes back.

				MURPHY
		North Island, have you got any 
		additional information? Over.

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The

	A long beat as the static of the open channel comes back.

				MURPHY
		Roger, North Island. I am tied to 
		the passenger vessel Chimera. And 
		she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. 
		Over.

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is 
		United States Coast Guard North Island 
		Station. Over and out.

	A beat as they hold there, thinking about it.

				MURPHY
		Obviously it's some kind of screw 
		up. The shipping records aren't a 
		hundred percent accurate.

				DODGE
		Man, it gives me the creeps. We got 
		no business towing a ship that size 
		anyway. I say we fix the turbines 
		and hit the highway.

				GREER
		Are you crazy? Do you realize we got 
		ourselves a ship? We own a ship, 
		Dodge.

				DODGE
		Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have 
		been lost at sea fifty years ago. 
		You don't think that's just a little 
		freaky?

				EPPS
		If this thing turns out to be a ship 
		everybody thought sank a long time 
		ago, we just hit the jackpot.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well how the hell you get 
		something like that wrong? That's a 
		damn big boat. It's either sunk or 
		it ain't.

				MURPHY
		We all want to get outa here, Dodge. 
		Especially me. With that boat in 
		tow. You got three days.  Make the 
		most of it.

	A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming 
	to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates 
	to Dubayy.

	Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows 
	the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz 
	into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as 
	he looks on at it.

	He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He 
	empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts 
	from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks 
	over the passenger manifest.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY

	Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last 
	night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of 
	the papers inside.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads 
	in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he 
	skins his knuckles.

				DODGE
		Fucker!

				GREER
		Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a 
		piece of metal.

				DODGE
			(inspecting his skinned 
			knuckles)
		Damn mind of it's own.

				GREER
			(seeing Murphy)
		Morning, skipper.

	Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.

				MURPHY
		Morning.

				GREER
		You're up late.

				MURPHY
		Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. 
		Where's Epps?

				DODGE
		Went aboard.

				MURPHY
		She take a radio?

				GREER
		Yeah.

	Murphy nods. A beat.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
	into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
	steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
	about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
	CAN BE HEARD.

	A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
	sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
	TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
	her, now silent.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door 
	where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through 
	it.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port 
	holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming 
	pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating 
	bizarre patterns.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs 
	there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie 
	on the floor.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

	INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment 
	circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine 
	ball.

	She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
	4' stack of gold ingots.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		What the fuck we gonna do with it?

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
		ours.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

				MURPHY
		The sooner we get under way, the 
		sooner we are to spending what's 
		ours.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum 
	fitting over one of the open turbines.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space 
	beyond the twisted hatch.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
			(as Epps stacks the 
			last one)
		Two twenty two.

	Greer makes a note.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty two kilograms of 
		solid gold.

				EPPS
		That's what I call a payday.

				GREER
		Hell yeah.

	They slap hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
	on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
	curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, this is 
		tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha 
		sierra bravo four zero niner two. 
		Radio check. Over.

	A moment, then:

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic 
		Warrior. This is United States 
		Coastguard Station North Island. 
		Your radio check is affirmative. 
		Over.

				MURPHY
		Roger that, North Island. Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over and out.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and 
	takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under 
	the stark light of a gas lantern.

				GREER
		Fifty million four ways. That's twelve 
		million and change a piece.  What 
		you gonna do with your share, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Not much at all, I guess. Retire.  
		Live out my golden years and all 
		that.

				DODGE
		I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.  
		Spend my time hauling rich Seattle 
		business men through the Puget.

				MURPHY
		How about you Epps?

				EPPS
		Guess I'll just keep working.

				DODGE
		What're you crazy?

				EPPS
		I like my job.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

				GREER
		Moving to Sweden.

				DODGE
		What's so great about Sweden?

				GREER
		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

				EPPS
		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder 
		the better.

				DODGE
		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish 
		girls you only gonna dream about.

				GREER
		We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
		doing if we don't get this boat 
		running.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

				MURPHY
		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

				GREER
		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	No response.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner 
		two. Last known position one seven 
		four west, five seven north. I am 
		afloat and drifting.  Require 
		immediate medical assistance for one 
		person, possibly comatose. I am a 
		one hundred twenty foot civilian 
		tug, hove to at port bow of disabled 
		passenger liner Chimera. I repeat, 
		Chimera. Over.

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

			 THE END
